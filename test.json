Whatcha gonna do, right?  \n  \nI guess I won’t quite start off at the beginning – but I’ll get there just as quickly as I can. Many of the powerful testimonies you’ll here involve drugs, sex, (maybe) rock ‘n’ roll, and this miraculous, love-crazed savior (which indeed he is) that dragged up the poor, overwhelmed sinner from his pit. Mine’s a bit like that – but God didn’t save me from drugs – he saved me from pride. He didn’t save me from sex either – just ignorance. He certainly didn’t save me from rock ‘n’ roll – but he saved me from the only individual who can tell me a perfect lie that I’ll always believe – myself. No fireworks, just the great heart of an unrelenting God that would never give up on me.  \n<!--more-->  \n  \nRomans 3:23 – For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  \n  \nI was born a child of privilege. I’ve come to accept that to be a simple, over-riding truth of my life. Not that my parents were wealthy – far from it, my needs were met and we never went hungry, but we didn’t do too much more than make ends meet either. No, when I say privilege – I mean that I had every opportunity to succeed, and very few chances to fail. My father was an elder in the church, my mother sang in the choir. Dad is one of my best friends – always has been, always will be – and I can honestly say the wisest man I know – no hyperbole, no exaggeration, and many would agree with me. Mom is an artist, a marathoner, disciplined, musical, and carried a 4.0 all the way through college – she stayed at home through my whole school career. Dad instilled in me a love of true beauty and a search for truth, mom a drive and confidence that few other people could bestow upon another. Are they perfect? Not quite – but they are far more a blessing than any person deserves or would ever think to ask for. With very few exceptions, anything good or strong in my character came directly from them, anything dark or weak – that lies solely on my shoulders, promise. So, if they were that active and involved, I’m automatically a Christian, right? Not so fast – the answer is absolutely not. I remember my childhood – praying over and over that God would save me - most nights, in fact, as my dad prayed with me. He just let it go on and on, until one day, I stopped – I was finally confident that I’d prayed it enough and I was good to go. As time went on – I lived well. I usually did the right thing, despite a penchant and talent for lying; I was the good, quiet kid who knew all the answers. I was a leader in the youth group – even in junior high – I’d been instrumental in a few other kids’ belief in Christ. Sunday school teachers were glad to have me, church leaders enjoyed visiting with me, I was “one of the most steadfast young me to grow up in the church.” And once I was old enough to feel encumbered by “the rules,” and recognize it… I was miserable.  \n  \nRomans 6:23 – The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.  \n  \nI went to a tiny Christian school right up until high school. Now, depending on your background, that could lead you to believe I’m talking about a high-powered, money wielding private school. I’m not. Practically volunteer teachers, borrowed text books, a church that put us up in an old, rickety house they had on their land, and never more than 50 kids, and only about 6 in any given class. Regardless, one more situation where I was surrounded by good people who genuinely cared for me (seems to be a recurring theme). At the end of my seventh grade year, the school didn’t have enough staff to add on any eighth graders – our public junior high didn’t have many marks in its favor – and mom decided to home-school me… that poor, poor woman. Little did she know that in this home-school year, everything that I had been up to this point would come crashing down – beautiful how life works like that, isn’t it? I didn’t know it at the time, but I was miserable, depressed, sick of living by rules and regulations that meant not a thing to me. I cried most days, slammed an algebra or Spanish book into a wall some others. Convinced myself that my mother hated me – that she didn’t want me to have friends, didn’t want to let me grow up, who knows what else. But a year of this was not what anybody wanted, that much I know for sure. As time progressed, my depression deepened – everything bothered me, and perhaps more importantly – everything bothered me more than it should. Suicide was at least a weekly thought, I’ve always been a little dark, so at first it was something that had some pleasure to it – just an emotional release. But it grew. Looking back, I clearly remember a day when everything had gone badly and I wanted no part of it. I convinced myself that Mom hated me and would be happy, that Dad would be sad for a bit, but I was just another mouth to feed in the end – he’d be better off, and my little brother would never remember me except through the cold looks in my parents eyes when the crossed a particular patch of our concrete drive way below the apex of our roof line. Death was all I wanted, all I deserved.  \n  \nRomans 5:8 – God demonstrates his own love for us in this, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.  \n  \nI bent my knees, just slightly, standing on the edge – snot dripping down my face, tears falling to the concrete – just a regular day, right? Mom walked out the door, and saw me on the roof, crying. She let me know she loved me, and told me lunch was inside whenever I was ready. I cried a bit more, climbed down and went on in – I’m not sure that she knew my intention, but she was there for a reason. School went on – I was a little less of a roller coaster, but the world isn’t that much better when it’s all dull, grey, and lifeless – so I can hardly say I’d improved. Even then though, looking back, God was beginning to call to me. I started writing songs then – which has continued until this day, in fact. I started recognizing the beauty in people, in things – which was a step up from where I’d been. I was looking forward to a retreat our youth group was going on that was coming up in April – in retrospect, I was looking forward to it with very good reason.  \n  \nRomans 10:13 - Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.  \n  \nFalls Creek – the name of the retreat – perhaps you’ve been there, who knows. My best friend’s father was speaking that year, he has a tendency to recycle sermons – I’d heard and could quote about half of the ones he was giving us at the retreat. “Sermon 4 with a twist into 7 there at the end” was the running joke for me. Yet, he is a very gifted speaker, and a very deep and intellectual Christian – despite my misgivings about his “green sermons.” Regardless, as he spoke, he eventually said something that rang true with me, something I had been patiently waiting for since that first time I’d been convinced I’d prayed enough to become a Christian. Something I’d been striving towards and fighting for without ever knowing it. In his big, excited, yelling pastoral voice, he pronounced that “Guys, if you’re a Christian, and you’re not living right, you’re going to be miserable” – it was sermon 6, not one of his overly evangelical ones, a little more geared towards discipleship. But suddenly, I realized the reality of my predicament – I was living by the rules. I should be at least somewhat happy. I was miserable. The truth finally came out – I wasn’t a Christian, it was the only solution that made sense. I was bound, gagged, and beaten by my own false belief in my Christianity. “The rules” weren’t rules at all – not to constrict as I had known them at least. The rules were freedom – they gave me the ability to do what was right, the ability to connect to my creator, the ability to finally become who I’d thought I was and been meant to be all along. My soul cried out for this, and despite all the lies I’d accepted, the truths I’d denied – the moment had come: I was called. Wanted. Loved.  \n  \nRomans 10:9,10 - If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, you shall be saved; for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.  \n  \nThat night, my world changed. All the things I’d used to fill the blackness inside were rendered completely and utterly irrelevant and insignificant. Grades, friends, girls, athleticism, rugged good looks – all useless and stripped bare for what they were – a poor substitute for what really mattered. Those things bring happiness – sure, but they don’t bring joy. They don’t bring the unerring knowledge that whatever happens, an infinite being cares for you. God took me in his hands that day and revolutionized me. My good days – he makes great. My mediocre days – he gives direction. My bad days – he gives purpose. One man died that all might live, and I have found my life, my true life, in him – and it is only the beginning of the story."},"url":{"en-US":"of-salvation"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/of-salvation/"}}},

Like in a fairytale, my princess is stuck in _that_ specific tower. I’ll slay the dragon, kiss the girl, we’ll get married and the people rejoice! No, life is much more confusing. I’ll likely fall in love with the dragon instead, realizing my mistake only after she bites my legs off.  \n  \nThe truth is… I’m incredibly scared of a bad marriage. Looking at relationships around me, I’ve got a 50/50 chance of having my own marriage spiral down into deceit, bitterness, and hatred. I know marriage is tough, and it requires a lot of work from both parties. At this point in my life, I think part of preparing for the right marriage is figuring out who the right woman is to pursue.  \n<!--more-->  \n  \n**A woman that is constantly seeking after God**   \n  \nThere is comfort in knowing that my wife will not find her worth in me. I’m imperfect and selfish and will fall short of providing her what she truly needs in life. I can feel secure about my marriage knowing her strength and joy comes from a loving and perfect God.  \n  \nAt the end of his [message](http://theporchdallas.com/media/) on James, JP proudly told us how his wife’s pursuit of God’s heart turned a financial burden into blessings for him and the people in their life. How powerful is the wisdom of a woman who pursues God with her whole heart? She can become the great rescuer of a man’s sanity, a future marriage and family. A wife of noble character is her husband’s crown, but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones (Proverbs 12:4).  \n  \nIn the book of Genesis we see Potiphar act on the false accusations of his jealous and unfaithful wife. By throwing Joseph into prison, we know he loses his most trusted servant and the blessings that followed the future COO of Egypt. I know my wife will have a huge influence on my decisions and my actions. To ensure I’m being the man I should be, I need her biggest influence to come from the ultimate source of love and wisdom.  \n  \n**A woman that will help me be a better man**  \n  \nIn a recent [post](http://donmilleris.com/2010/06/24/in-response-to-mike-adams/), Donald Miller recounted a story of a successful business man that had to call his wife to tell her they were going to go bankrupt. He was distraught and a mental wreck. It wasn’t her voice on the other line that brought him peace. It was her wisdom. She told him not to worry, that their eternal life was secure, and to go read Ecclesiastes. He did, and was able to sleep in peace.  \n  \nLooking to historical figures, Abigail was the biggest influence in the life of John Adams. She acted as his political advisor and was his intellectual equal in all their conversations and correspondence. A total of 1,160 letters have survived out of their abundant exchanges over the years. No other person would be able to access the heart and mind of John Adams as Abigail could. This powerful friendship was recognized and respected by all those that surrounded them.  \n  \nMany successful men have relied incredibly on their wives to get through trials and to guide their path. The right woman will inspire you to be a better man and help you achieve greater heights that you couldn’t otherwise do alone.  \n  \n**A woman I know I’ll have to wait for**  \n  \nIt takes time to learn someone. Far too many men have fallen for the beauty of Helen of Troy or have been lured by the seductive melody of [enchanted sirens](http://www.greek-gods.info/ancient-greek-gods/sirens/). Flashes of loneliness and impatience can lead anyone to quit the waiting game and commit solitary suicide on the wrong pretenses and for the wrong woman.  \n  \nAs I set my sights on God and follow after Him, I know He will open my eyes to the right woman when the time is right."},"url":{"en-US":"the-woman-to-pursue"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-woman-to-pursue/"}}},

If you're familiar with Ezekiel, you might recall that it can be a little bit hard on the brain with all the imagery, visions, and prophecies that the Lord gives Ezekiel while he is in exile (in Babylon). The first nine verses of Ezekiel 33, though, are a like a clear pane in an otherwise frosted or stained-glass window.  \n  \nIn short, the Lord is telling Ezekiel that he is a watchman for Israel. The watchman's role is to be on the alert, eyes open, scanning for impending danger. When the watchman sees danger coming, it is his job to warn the people so that they might be saved/delivered/protected. The Lord tells Ezekiel that he is the spiritual watchman for the people of Israel and that when the Lord gives words of warning to Ezekiel, he must tell them to the people or else the Lord will hold him (Ezekiel) responsible for the people's failure to repent.  \n<!--more-->  \nAs men and women redeemed by Christ, we are watchmen with so much more of the Word of God than even Ezekiel had. And it is our calling--yea, God's will for us--to warn those around us of danger we see coming to their lives, whether that be from the trappings of the world, damaging relationships, or anything else about which the Lord has spoken in His Word. We are around folks every day and week who are heading toward destruction. I pray that the Lord opens all of our eyes (mine included) to see this and to stir a desperation within us to \"hold them back\".  \n  \n\"Deliver those who are being taken away to death,  \n  \nAnd those who are staggering to slaughter, Oh hold them back.\"  \n  \n~Proverbs 24:11 (NASB)"},"url":{"en-US":"oh-hold-them-back"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/oh-hold-them-back/"}}},

Romans 12:2 puts it plain and simple: Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.  \n  \nMy life this year has been just that. I’ve literally pulled up to bars/clubs, only to apologize to the valet that I've changed my mind, drive off, and head back home because my desire has completely changed from before. I now know there is no life found there. Only temptation, brokenness, and regret. Instead of entering into or staying in relationships that I know are not right because of co-dependency and loneliness or even the fear of forever being single… I've been able to walk away and trust not in my deceitful heart or selfish desires, but completely trust in the Lord and his perfect plan for my life.  \n<!--more-->  \nI’ve been able to be transparent, admit mistakes, ask for forgiveness, forgive others, and handle situations completely different than before. Moments when dealing with situations about relationships, friendships, and job decisions I’ve literally in my head reminded myself “BE TRANSFORMED…Do not handle things they way you’ve always done or make decisions selfishly. Do things in a way that is most glorifying to the Lord.”  \n  \nI sit in awe of the lessons I am learning through these situations and complete amazement at the work he has done in me and in my life. I have had no regrets when handling things in a way honoring to the Lord, only excitement at knowing that when we come near to God, he comes near to us (James 4:8). HE IS FAITHFUL. He has changed my desires, changed my heart, and I am forever changed by the Gospel. I pray that my life be a reflection of this and ask for forgiveness when it’s not.  \n  \nSo I ask you the same question Patrick asked Tuesday, “In what ways are you living opposite of the world?”  \n  \nHow do you handle your money, time, relationships, authority, and decisions?

Found after the book of Hebrews and before 1 Peter. He wrote to give Jewish Christians facing persecution instruction on how to prepare and get through trials when they come.  \n  \nKey word above: WHEN. Looking at the verbiage of the text, it doesn't say 'if' trials happen, but 'when'. JP even pointed out that they are not just promised to come, but come in all shapes, sizes, color, and style. Awesome. - ok, sarcasm in the awesome aside, it really is awesome. You're probably thinking, what? This girl is nuts. Now let me expand.  \n<!--more-->  \nSo here's the deal. James says that trials will happen; that there will be some horrible things in life that come your way. You might have never thought you would have to deal with the death of a loved one, the divorce, the miscarriage, the betrayal, the cancer, the addiction, the disease, the loneliness, the unemployment, the unforeseen happenstances of life. However, throughout the text he gives us instruction on how to persevere through these trials and how ultimately they are for our good. …. Hold that thought. We will come full circle here in a second on how they are for our good.  \n  \nJames first shows that our attitude in trails needs to be that of all encompassing joy. Not misery, complaining, self-pity in the midst of it - and joy once you have weathered the storm, but joy throughout!  \n  \nSecondly, James shows us the advantage of trials. As a runner, I was able to relate to the analogy of training for a marathon. You must push yourself to see improvement. You must try to run the set distance faster, or go for a longer run. The pain that is felt during the training will be outweighed by the joy of knowing that you are becoming a better, faster, stronger runner and that it will show in the race. Now convert that to our race analogy to your life. Take a second to think about how \\_\\_(trial)\\_\\_ is making you \\_\\_(positive word)\\_\\_.  \n  \nThe third tool James gives us is what to use as assistance during trials. He is clear. Ask God to help us, to help us learn what we need to become that better/faster/stronger/... Christ follower. Also, we are to live in Christian fellowship so that we can have honest and open friends to pray for us, encourage us, and speak God's truth into our lives when we are in the midst of trials.  \n  \nNow rewind to that thought I said hold onto and we will come back to. Now is the time to revisit the crazy statement I made above that That these trials are or our ultimate good. So how are these trials for our good?  \n  \nWhy do we even need the tools above, if we could get by without having to endure trials at all? God doesn't desire us to be mediocre people. He wants me to be the best me, and for you to be the best you. So God, in his sovereign, all knowing, power, allows situations to arise that he knows will make us grow into more complete people. Let’s revist vs 12: “Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.” It all comes back to Hope."},"url":{"en-US":"joy-in-the-midst-of-trials"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/joy-in-the-midst-of-trials/"}}},

The words Jesus speaks in Matthew, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?” The beginning of the next chapter continues to say, “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.”  \n  \nThe Lord has shown me over the last six years or so that my plans are in vain. He knows me. I am his child. He knows that He had to make many of my plans go up in smoke or become virtually impossible, so that I must look to him for guidance and to see where he wants me and what he has in store. The more I have learned to listen and follow, the more I can truly say that God knows what he is doing, as he leads me down roads I never could have imagined, yet how sweet they are.  \n<!--more-->  \nI love keeping a prayer journal because sometimes I look back through and see how faithful the Lord was in all things – big and small. How he distinctly answers some of my prayers, as I ask, or as he creatively answers in a different and better way.  \n  \nI never had planned to move to Dallas, but God was tugging on my heart, and I was feeling led here. As I started to earnestly pray about what was next and where to go, Dallas just kept coming back. Then the way He so graciously opened all doors, a job that is perfect for me and able to live with my best friend. As I was preparing to come down here I loved the preceding words in Matthew, as I knew the Lord would take care of me. I prayed, and still do, that he would go before me and prepare my way. That we would open up a great living situation, and great friends. That he would lead me to amazing community and a place that I feel like I can just be me. I know I have only been here for about two weeks, but I have to say he has answered those prayers better than I ever could have imagined. The friends he has brought into my life, the living situation, the job, church, everything. I am so thankful to my loving Father who truly does take care of his children."},"url":{"en-US":"many-are-mine-perfect-is-his"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/many-are-mine-perfect-is-his/"}}},

We love, because He first loved us. If someone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also.\" ~1 John 4:18-21  \n  \nIn relationships, romantic primarily but also platonic, we often have an element of fear entwined, which leads us to the anxiety, butterflies, and other similar apprehension so common to insecure situations. We fear that if we misspeak or fail to act in an expected manner, the other person will reject us. Although this is more of a secondary application of the above passage from 1 John, I believe that the other person's rejection is the punishment linked to our fear. Consequently, we do not have perfect love, because we are convinced that their love is in some way conditional. And it may be.  \n<!--more-->  \nI want this to be different in my life. To engage with others regardless of motivation (friendship, romance, ministry) in order to bless and love them, this is my desire. But I fear that without the reciprocal, I will find myself a mile or two down the road, stranded and hurt. Can I find my security and hope firmly in the Lord such that I may say, \"The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord\" (Job 1:21b)? In all honesty? No, I'm not there yet.  \n  \n\"Yet.\" It is a word that indicates an unfulfilled, but eventual hope. Though the journey is ongoing, the destination has not been abandoned. By the grace of God and through the sanctification of the saints (Philippians 1:6), we can arrive at perfect love, which is anchored in God's love for us (1 John 4:10-11). Then, fear will be no more. My security will not be in human hands, but in the Father, who is the essence of love. Then, I will be truly free to love without concern for someone's response.  \n  \nSo what does this mean for today, tomorrow, and those in our lives? First and foremost, we must seek a supreme pleasure and joy in God. Our love for Him must outpace all others, and our sense of worth should be based on what He says of us, rather than anything else. I have to preach this to myself daily, even hourly, or else I will be swayed by my emotions, feelings and the world around me. Then, encourage one another with the same message and seek to love them with perfect love--fearless love. If God's love lives in us, we will not fear uncertain situations. Rather, we will embrace them with His love and know that He holds all time and all people in His hands.\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"fear-love-in-relationships"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/fear-love-in-relationships/"}}},

We often think of sinning as something we do…not things we say. Many times we even shrink “bad words” to just cursing…instead of any that are not glorifying the Lord. Praying about what to send out today really made me evaluate my own life.  \n  \nI loved when JP said “There’s something rotten inside so something rotten comes out…Wanna know what’s going on with someone? Listen to how they speak.”  \n  \nLuke 6: 45 The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.  \n  \nOften we use some of these excuses when we talk about others who aren’t around: “Well I’d say this to his/her face so it’s ok for me to say it to you”, or “It’s just a funny story it’s not a big deal”, or “She/he would tell you about it so it’s ok that I do”. I also realized that a lot of times it’s our own insecurities that cause us to put others down. If we say something bad about someone else, it might somehow make us look better/feel better. Those situations never turn out that way though.  \n  \nWhen I got divorced a lot of people were surprised that my ex-husband’s affair didn’t hurt me near as bad as realizing all the lies he had told me. JP was right when he said “the only way to cover up a lie is with another lie” and my ex got really good at that. It took a long time and a lot of prayer to forgive him for all the lies and cheating, but I also had to confess to him and ask him for forgiveness for talking poorly about him and his family after our divorce.  \n<!--more-->  \n  \nIt’s a hard thing to go to people you’ve talked poorly about or people you’ve lied to and ask for forgiveness. By doing so though you are allowing for the Lord to give you peace, restore you, and be glorified. I can’t begin to express the peace that finally came from forgiving my ex-husband for his lies, and asking him for forgiveness for gossiping about him and his family. Then through that God provided opportunity for me to share the Gospel with my ex-husband (amazing!). Praise God for his unending mercy, grace, and love.  \n  \nIs there anyone you have gossiped or talked poorly about? Have you seeked forgiveness? Is there anyone who has hurt you with words? Have you spoken to them about it and forgiven them? Are there times where you get frustrated and curse/yell, or tell a joke/story that would have been just as good without the cursing? Are you working on your speech?  \n  \nJames 3:9-10 With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness. Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers, this should not be.  \n  \nFather I pray for my friends reading this that we will never lose sight of the cross and the price you paid for our sins. I pray that we will seek forgiveness from those who we have hurt with our words, and forgive those who have hurt us. I pray that we will walk in the light and that the words of our mouth and meditation of our heart will be pleasing in your sight O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer (Psalm 19:14).  \n  \nPraying for you all~"},"url":{"en-US":"the-truth-is-always-good-enough"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-truth-is-always-good-enough/"}}},

Have you ever experienced something so beautiful with the Lord that words cannot describe, yet you want to tell the whole world? Today was another one of those days. What I love about it, is that these moments are always so unexpected. I had to run home to write, because I can't afford to forget these gifts that the Lord provides of experiencing His love. I am officially wooed. So, I'll start from the beginning of how this morning played out.  \n  \nI woke up this morning at 7am. Rested, but with a distracted mind. This is actually how I've been all week. Distracted and anxious in thought through different events..work, personal, etc. All self-centered, all self-consuming. I feel when I start to get spiritually dry..my Heart starts to cry out for the Lord.  \n  \nI called out to Him this morning- asked Him to please rid me of myself. To blanket me with His love and to forgive me for my self-centerdness. To guide me, use me for His will. For my actions to reflect His image and not my own. My Heart cried out this morning and He responded.  \n<!--more-->  \nI went to the Homeless Soup kitchen at 8:30, which I often go to on Saturdays. Today, However was a special day. I spoke to two people -- Ruben and Phillip. For today, I want to focus on my conversation with Phillip.  \n  \nI met Phillip at the gates of the World Impact Center. Young, black man - mid 30s. I was standing with Pastor John when he approached us and asked us \"So, why are ya'll here..? What is the purpose of all of this.\" He asked this, not in a rude way, but in a genuine way, as if he was trying to figure out what the catch was. Pastor John said \"We are here to love on people.\" Phillips face seemed confused. He said, \"Ive been to these things before. It's like a trick.. a trap. I almost gave my life to Christ once, and everything made sense, up until the point that they asked people to stand up and roll on the floor if they wanted to accept Christ into their hearts.\"  \n  \nSometime later, I happened to run into Phillip again. He was sitting on one of the benches. He asked me, \"So, people come here for the free coffee and the breakfast, huh?\" This is a good draw to get people to come. That's smart.\" Again, in an observant type of tone.  \n  \nI smiled at him and told him..\"People don't come here for the coffee\" They come because of the relationships that are built here. For the healing that occurs. For the Love that is offered without strings attached. Unlike anything they have ever experienced. Unlike anything I have ever experienced.  \n  \nYou see, homeless people have a list of options to go to on Saturday mornings for food. There are different government, religious organizations that reach out to them on the weekends. More so, than during the week. This is when they get a chance to really get a good meal.  \n  \nHowever, more and more people come to Solomon's Porch..not for the coffee or the food - but because they know there is something different about this place. Something is happening here. They cant put their finger on it - but they feel it.  \n  \nI felt this. When I first walked into Solomon's Porch as a volunteer, I had no idea what to expect. I had no idea how my heart would be transformed and how much the Lord would use me to speak truth into these people's lives as long as I would allow Him to. I explained this to Phillip.  \n  \nHe began to tell me about his life. His hurts, his mistakes, his regrets, and his doubt in this concept of God. Everything he was saying I could completely connect with. I shared my story with him. He was so scared to let go and let God. He still is.  \n  \nThere are so many things that we touched on that I really cant believe it was all in one morning. I literally saw the Lord soften his heart. Tugging at his heart. Calling out to him. I see so much potential in Phillip. He is smart, introspective, and observes everything. He wants to understand everything.  \n  \nHe said \"This is weird.. I came here for coffee, I never expected this.\" He told me that he didn't know what to do. Part of him wanted so bad to surrender his life to Christ, but then another side couldn't do it. He kept saying that he couldnt believe that people came out and did this for no reason at all, other than to show love to one another.  \n  \nPhillip is my brother in Christ. He shared his heart with me today, and the Lord used me to speak to him about His magnificent love and healing power. I could see a change in Phillip. Thinking, processing. He told me he had a strong desire to one day be able to speak truth to others and share his story as I had shared mine. Through our stories we are able to share HIS story...what a beautiful connection this is.

James 2:14-26. The message was about faith and deeds and how each of these directly effects our individual spiritual growth and witness to a watching world.  \n  \nJames 2:17 “In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.”  \n  \n2:18 “…Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.”  \n  \n2:22 “You see that his faith and his action were working together.”  \n  \nWhen is the last time you put your belief (faith) into action? Would you say that you take what you read in God’s word and actually apply it, you act on it in reality? One of the most convicting verses for me last week was James 2:19 “You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that – and shudder.” Think about that. It’s really not that hard to say you believe in God. We have knowledge of him, we read about His work in the bible and we’ve seen His work in the lives of those around us. Even the demons of hell know and believe that too! The thought of possibly being compared to one of them makes me shudder. I pray we all do more than just give lip service to our King.  \n<!--more-->  \n  \nHebrews 11 showcases the faithful servants who understood faith and action working together. It is titled “Faith in Action.” You must read it! They all DID things to back up their faith. “Abraham offered Isaac,” “Noah built an ark,” “Rahab, because she welcomed the spies,” on and on they believed and so they acted. They are described as righteous, friend of God, heirs to the inheritance.  \n  \nTrusting in the knowledge of God is faith. How are you and your friends doing in this? Are you helping each other make tough choices? From last week’s message, are you intentionally helping the poor or those that can do nothing for you? Do you believe that God wants more for you, so you’ll ACT to stop going to bars to get drunk? Do you believe that God loves you, with a pure love (1 John 3:1), so you’ll ACT to stop giving yourself away to unhealthy relationships? I pray you trust what you read, therefore following through in doing it.  \n  \nI encourage you to read James 1-3 in preparation for tomorrow. Look forward to seeing you and diving back in.  \n  \nPraying for each of you!"},"url":{"en-US":"faith-that-does"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/faith-that-does/"}}},

I encourage you all to go back and read through those verses as well as Matthew 25:31-46.  \n  \nJP spoke on FAVORITISM...  \n  \nJames 2:1 My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism.  \n  \nRomans 2:11 For God does not show favoritism.  \n  \nWhether we like to admit it or not we all have favorites, those that we give our best...our A-Game too. In our lives we either run to people like ourselves or we run to people we want to become like. The problem with this is: WE ARE CALLED TO LOVE EVERYONE, INCLUDING THOSE WHO CAN DO NOTHING FOR US IN RETURN.  \n<!--more-->  \n  \nCheck out Matthew 5:46-47  \n  \nIf you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?  \n  \nIt's not just what you do FOR others, but also what you have DONE to others. My heart sinks just thinking about that. There have been many times I've been hurt, used, and ignored by others...I think we all know that feeling, and times I've hurt and ignored not just strangers...but friends.  \n  \nMatthew 25: 40 & 45 \"The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'...\"He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'  \n  \nWho are the people you are only doing things for to get something in return? If they all the sudden could do nothing for you, would you continue to be around them? Are you doing things out of love or selfish ambition? Who are the people around you that need your help? Where/how are you giving to and serving others? I pray that we will become givers...instead of consumers, host...instead of guest, and do all things out of love for our Father...who has already given us everything.  \n  \n1 John 3:16-18 This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers. If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him? Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.  \n  \nPraying for you all~"},"url":{"en-US":"who-gets-your-a-game"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/who-gets-your-a-game/"}}},

They pull you in and place the whole world on front of you. You don’t realize this yet, but it becomes a shackle, a sort of ball and chain”  \n  \nHe brought his hands up to my neckline and closed an imaginary shackle around my throat. I looked down and envisioned an iron chain that connected to a small cannon ball on the floor.  \n  \n“As time goes on they throw in some nice promotions, pay increases, bonuses. You feel good and you want more. So they give it to you. Soon, you’re married and have kids so you need to throw that into the mix as well. You have obligations, responsibility and it begins to weigh heavy on your shoulders. You don’t notice it at first, but your ball and chain begins to grow…  \n\n**It gets bigger** (wow, I can afford that BMW I’ve always wanted)…\n\n  \n\n**and bigger** (my wife wants to move into a five bedroom house)…\n\n  \n\n**and bigger** (the VP position is open and they’re considering _me!_)…\n\n  \nBefore you know it you’re grasping with your arms and legs, you’re holding onto this gigantic ball for dear life, and you’re praying to god no one takes it away from you.”  \n  \nDriving home I began looking back on my life. I knew I grew up with popularity issues. A character flaw that had me climbing up the ladder, reaching a certain point, and finding myself wanting more. It was a vicious cycle of [favoritism](http://theporchdallas.com/who-gets-your-a-game/). There was this desire in me to be viewed as one of the few on the inside with everyone on the outside looking in. I spent money on things I didn’t need to impress people I didn’t even like.  \n<!--more-->  \nIn the corporate world there are multiple ladders and inner circles. As you work your way into one inner ring you find that it’s in fact the fringe of something even bigger, something even better, and you want in. I realized this was my reality. The pursuit of wealth and power was not specifically for those things, but how it played into the bigger picture. The chain that was slowly wrapping itself around my neck was a mindset that I had been suffering from since middle school.  \n  \n  \nIn his Memorial Lecture at King’s College, C.S. Lewis described this as the phenomenon of the inner ring.  \n  \n_To a young person, just entering on adult life, the world seems full of Insides, full of delightful intimacies and confidentialities, and he desires to enter them. But if he follows that desire he will reach no “inside” that is worth reaching. As long as you are governed by that desire you will never get what you want. You are trying to peel an onion: if you succeed there will be nothing left._   \n  \nThe things we pursue in life shape the world around us. To a certain extent, the desires we choose will determine if our time on earth transforms into a region in Hell or becomes a reflection of Heaven itself. The focus of my desires was creating a sort of “hell on earth” within me. I was constantly envious and never satisfied. My mind was spiraling down a mental gauntlet that obstructed me from fully engaging in relationships and appreciating life as it is.  \n  \nRealizing where my heart truly was, I began the painful struggle of letting go of my ambitions and my pride. I began a slow evolution. I was now looking towards and pursuing a God with plans to prosper me, not to harm me, plans that gave me hope and a future. In many ways, it was a [great divorce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Divorce) of some sort… But, it has been in this new pursuit that I’ve begun to see God changing something within me and opening my eyes to a world that I know He truly intended.  \n  \n“I think earth, if chosen instead of Heaven, will turn out to have been, all along, only a region in Hell: and earth, if put second to Heaven, to have been from the beginning a part of Heaven itself.” – C.S. Lewis in The Great Divorce"},"url":{"en-US":"climbing-up-the-popularity-i-mean-corporate-ladder"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/climbing-up-the-popularity-i-mean-corporate-ladder/"}}},

We camped out in James 3:13-18 speaking of 'Two Kinds of Wisdom.' James makes us take a hard look at our pride, what we believe is and is not wise and how we are living out wisdom.  \n  \nJP asked “Who is God to you?” So…Is he Creator? Is He a big mean ruler? Is He a fun killer? Is He your lucky charm that you call on only in emergencies? Is He your loving Father, yearning for a relationship with you so He can set you free from the gripes of sin?  \n  \nWhen you really ponder that question, it is challenging.  \nProverbs 1:7 “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.”  \nProverbs 9:10 “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.”  \nDo you live your life like you actually believe God? Would others say about me, “She shows her good life by deeds done in humility that come from wisdom” (James 3:13)? What would they say about you?  \n<!--more-->  \n  \nTrue wisdom comes from knowledge and understanding that there is a God, by having a relationship with Him through Jesus Christ, to live with Him forever in eternity. Reluctantly I admit that I am facing a situation right now where others are speaking into my life about an area that I’m struggling. I realize I have been looking through my own lens, my own perspective and “wisdom” (AKA Alicia’s justification), not at all through God’s lens of heavenly wisdom. No wonder there is disorder and division in my relationship – it’s because I am selfishly fighting for my own agenda (James 3:16). I have not asked God to show me His perspective or to provide me with His wisdom. If I do ask, then actually BELIEVE He will provide, wisdom will be given to me (James 1:5-6).  \n  \nJust like JP mentioned Shaq and Kobe’s conflict - think of someone at work you compete with (potentially in an unhealthy way), a boyfriend/girlfriend/friend/parent/sibling you fight with often. Are you prideful in your perspective, fighting anyone else’s perspective in order to keep your agenda? Is it not out of our own selfish ambition or envy that there is disorder and evil practice? The bible says heavenly wisdom is first – pure. It is also peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere (James 3:17). Those are radical descriptives to consider when relating to each other. I have not been submissive, pure or peace-loving in this conflict as my friends – based on GOD’S TRUTH – speak into my struggle. I pray that as I focus on who God is, the loving, faithful, sovereign Father, I will slowly begin to loosen my gripe on this sin so that my sinful perspective gets smaller and smaller. As I study God’s word to gain wisdom, truly trust in God’s character, it is then that by His grace I accept humility in action and deed. Through these experiences I fully come to trust in the God I say I believe.  \n  \nI am praying we are all transformed by our belief in God towards heavenly wisdom.  \n  \nPraying for you guys!"},"url":{"en-US":"who-do-you-believe-god-is"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/who-do-you-believe-god-is/"}}},

Mission trip, vacation, work. Most recently it's been for work. With this comes airport lines, flight delays, people who take forever in the security line...all leaving you silently murmuring ..\" Amazing Grace..how sweet the sound..\" Well, at least that's what I'd like to think! However, I don't always extend that grace..unfortunately. How quickly I turn it on and off.  \n  \nMission trip=on  \nWork trip= off  \n  \nI have to constantly check myself. The reason I say this is because I caught myself with it \"off\" this morning. I'm checking my bag at La Guardia in NY and there are some people in front of me who are \"inconveniencing me\" by taking forever, blocking my path, and overall little concern that _I have somewhere to be._ (sarcasm has been inserted here)  \n  \nMy thought process is like this \"This weekend was terrible. Ive been working non-stop since I got here and throughout the weekend and have to show up to work on Monday with a pile of things I missed while out of the office. I just want to go home...puleassseeee.\"  \n  \nThe lady who checked my bag noticed my frustration and made a rude comment. ouch. Negativity breeds negativity. Now, this type of thing would usually not bother me as it happened so fast , a split second that I had a frustrated, negative reaction. Within the next moment I look down at my silver bracelet. The one with the cross and [John 3:16](http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=10150223627120043&h=86dc98394b3e70815a0b4cf03904b2f3&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblegateway.com%2Fpassage%2F%3Fsearch%3DJohn%2B3%253A16%26version%3DNIV \"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=NIV\")verse.  \n  \nSo, a little back story...Three years ago, I lived in NYC. I developed a very NY state of mind after a while, all about taking care of number one. Having little time for people..where smiling was an inconvenience and southern hospitality ..is just plain \"weird.\" I became a New Yorker avoiding eye contact as I walked the busy streets, not stopping to look at the world around me, the people - God's people.  \n<!--more-->  \nOh, how things have changed! ..or have they? I look down at my bracelet and remember that I can't turn it on and off when it's convenient. I am a brand ambassador for Christ - no matter how tired, frustrated, stressed I may be. His people come first and my selfish desires, frustrations must be put to the side.  \n  \nYou see..you never know who is watching you and God is going to use you whenever **He desires.** Your heart shows its true colors in these situations. Christ extends grace to me daily..minute by minute, even during those milliseconds when I feel I _deserve_ to \"turn it off.\"  \n  \nNow, this next part is Great....because when my heart is NOT in the right place - the Lord brings it back to a much better place....  \n  \nI'm finally at the gate, pull out my laptop to catch up on emails. There is a girl behind me on her cell, and suddenly I hear the words **\"Guatemala, mission trip, and Antigua.\"** Its rare to hear these words so randomly in New York..unexpected place, unexpected time. However, I am intrigued. I tap her on her shoulder and say \"excuse me, I'm sorry for eavesdropping, but I overheard you say you are traveling to Guatemala?\"  \n  \nShe began to tell me how upset she was because she had planned this mission trip with one of her friends. However, her friend had a mild seizure at 2 am this morning, was currently at the hospital and obviously had to skip out on the trip. The issue was that her friend had planned the trip and had all the information of where they were to go -- so, she was left with a plane ticket, 100 pounds of children's clothes to take to orphanages which she did not know where they were located. In addition, she had no plans for the next 10 days beyond Antigua as she was leaning on her friend for the details and logistics. hmm..interesting.  \n  \nI began to tell her about my yearly mission trip to Guatemala and the village that I go to and the missionaries there. I told her that if she were interested I could connect her with them so that she could visit the village. She was ecstatic because that is exactly the sort of thing she had been wanting to do! We exchanged facebook info.  \n  \nThe great thing as I found is that she speaks Spanish & has also traveled quite a bit in her lifetime. Two VERY good things when you go to a third-world country with no set plans. Eased my immediate worry for this girl...Oh..but p.s. God always has a plan :)  \n  \nWe were called to begin boarding the plane and (surprise!) our seats were right next to each other. We continued to talk and she shared with me how much she enjoyed doing volunteer work and just recently started doing mission trips. She also told me that she stepped into a church for the first time two months ago, gave her life to Christ and hasn't been the same since..awesome.  \n  \nShortly after, we began to strike a conversation with the girl sitting next to me on my left. Grad student at Yale, studying ancient Christianity. Traveled all over the world and was most recently studying up on [monks.](http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=10150223627120043&h=ccf74d7b3674c2c8952ccc7e52856b9f&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMonk \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk\") Most of what she studied was so above my head that I was left with....\"wow, very interesting\" I had trouble deciphering parts of our conversation (I'm simple minded folk) and really understanding where exactly her faith was, so I just asked her.  \n  \nShe told me she was a \"non-believer\" hmm... interesting. \"So..are you an atheist?\" \"Yep, I was raised Lutheran, but you know, it just wasn't for me..\" However, she likes the study of religions from a historical perspective and she liked the philosphy of it all, she said.  \n  \nTo tell you the truth..atheist scare me. Not because they are scary people, but because usually they are so much smarter than me..:) They are very good at proving their arguments and many have dedicated countless hours proving this argument. If we're speaking battle of intellect, I will lose. If we are speaking matters of the heart...well, that's different. She was such a delight to talk to and so we engaged in a great conversation.  \n  \nAfter a while, I lay my head down on my tray table. As I'm sitting there, the girl to my right who has just discovered Christ is reading \"the Shack\" while the \"non-believer\" on my left is reading up on ancient religion.

Transportation, both of things and information, has indeed developed. Healthcare has progressed by leaps and bounds, too. But one area that remains mostly unchanged in its essence is religion. Of course, from the eye and even ear, the spiritual element of society appears vastly superior to temple- and idol-based worship of millennia past. Yet most of this is merely skin deep.  \n  \nDrawing from the book of Acts, we see the decadent lifestyles of many Roman cities. Antioch of Syria maintained the temple of Apollo at which worshippers reenacted Apollo's pursuit of Daphne by chasing and catching temple prostitutes in the surrounding park and forest. Ephesus held similar sexually-oriented rites in service to Diana (also known as \"Artemis\"), a goddess of fertility. Corinth, the melting pot of the Roman world due to shipping and trade, was known as one of the most luxuriant and debauched cities of its time. To be \"Corinthian\" meant to be loose, promiscuous, and openly immoral. And here, too, was another temple focused on faux worship.  \n  \nHow many of these so-called worshippers performed their religious \"duties\" out of a genuine urge to be more pleasing to their god(s)? Is it not more likely that for many the temples were an excuse to carry out their sensual desires under the guise of religion? Worship of sex rather than any specific god?  \n<!--more-->  \n  \nThus today the name of the god has changed, and the places of \"worship\" have grown more convenient. The god, Sex, can be served at a host of bars and clubs and in numerous magazines. And the newest frontier where more than a million new altars are erected each day is the Internet.  \n  \nThe nations of the past would be amazed at the level of depravity that goes from camera to hard drive and then streams through wire and airwave. The world has not changed. The Gospel of Jesus Christ remains the same as it did two thousand years ago: repent of your sins, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ that His sinless life and innocent, sacrificial, substitutionary death has made you pleasing to God, and be saved. Conversely, the hell-bound alternatives from the past several thousand years are alive and well today--with new names and more acceptable temples--satisfying the flesh and leading the soul to an eternity of darkness.  \n  \n\"What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.\" ~Ecclesiastes 1:9 NIV"},"url":{"en-US":"modern-day-temples"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/modern-day-temples/"}}},

Maybe I ask too many questions. I just can’t rest in the moment. Around the beginning of April I was in a pretty good place. There were still problems in my life because, well, that is life. But I could feel God moving and working in me. Then I basically shut down. In my head I had expected everything to suddenly get easier after April 15. I would no longer be working 65 hours a week. I’d have time to read, write, see my friends and just relax.  \n  \nIt didn’t turn out that way. I found out on April 15 that my grandmother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. My firm let several people go, including one of my few friends at the office. These things, added with a lot of other little things, led me to a spinning realm of chaos.  \n  \nI tried to figure out how to deal with it. I knew I should turn to God, but instead I began to fall back on old habits. I turned inward and tried to rely on myself. I shut myself off as much as I could. I didn’t want to open up to my community group, I didn’t want to read my Bible or journal. I gave in to my selfish sinful desires. Because of that, I felt like I couldn’t go back to God. I struggled to make myself pray – I would manage to find time to pray for friends and family, but I wouldn’t talk with God about me. Which is so silly, because it’s not like avoiding the subject will keep God from knowing about what is going on. You can’t hide your thoughts and feelings from him. Yet I tried. I could feel my heart hardening yet again. This is a cycle I’ve been through before.  \n<!--more-->  \n  \nI posted that song a couple weeks ago by Josh Wilson, \"Savior, Please\". That song broke through the callous shell I had put up – maybe that sounds trite, but it is true. That no matter how good I try to be, no matter how strong I think I am, no matter what I do, I am not enough. I need God. I need him to hold me up, to save me from myself.  \n  \n  \n  \nSavior, please take my hand  \n  \nI work so hard, I live so fast  \n  \nThis life begins, and then it ends  \n  \nAnd I do the best that I can, but I don’t know how long I’ll last  \n  \n  \n  \nI try to be so tough  \n  \nBut **I’m just not strong enough**  \n  \n**I can’t do this alone** , God I need You to hold on to me  \n  \n**I try to be good enough**  \n  \n**But I’m nothing without Your love**  \n  \nSavior, please keep saving me  \n  \n  \n  \nSavior, please help me stand  \n  \n**I fall so hard, I fade so fast**  \n  \nWill You begin right where I end  \n  \nAnd be the God of all I am because **You’re all I have**  \n  \n  \n  \nHallelujah  \n  \nEverything You are to me  \n  \nIs everything I’ll ever need  \n  \nAnd I am learning to believe  \n  \nThat I don’t have to prove a thing  \n  \n‘Cause You’re the one who’s saving me  \n  \n  \n  \n- Josh Wilson (emphasis mine)"},"url":{"en-US":"restless"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/restless/"}}},

I encourage you all to read back through those verses. He spoke on the battles we are going through: 1. The War Within You 2. The War Around You and 3. Victory Comes Through Brokenness.  \n  \nThere came a point in my life where the world around me seemed to have fallen apart. Everything I once had and thought of as needed for happiness had been taken from me within a two year time period. A head-on collision had left me changed physically, I was working a job that I didn’t enjoy, and my marriage was over. The war was within me. I tried to go to church, but would leave when the songs came on because I didn’t want anyone to see me cry. I had to be strong, being weak in my eyes would mean that my ex \"won\".  \n  \nI quickly made new friends that seemed to have everything going for them, and everything this world had to offer. I bought into it. I thought of myself as strong and in control. I got this. I didn’t need anyone. I loved this world and all that it had to offer. The more I was “living the life” as the world would say, the more temptations came, and the more it consumed me. The war was around me. I was an enemy of God.  \n<!--more-->  \n  \nJames 4:4 You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.  \n  \nIt got to a point where I felt so worthless. I knew what I was doing was wrong, but what hope did I have? Where do I even begin? I was too far gone… or so I thought.  \n  \nThere came a day where I couldn’t be “strong” anymore, I was tired of faking it and living only for this world, hiding any insecurity and pain I had. I was hopeless and broken…and I finally prayed. I prayed to God, even though I had turned my back on him time and time before. The difference was I now understood the Gospel and amazing grace that comes from surrendering my life to him and having a real relationship with my heavenly Father. (Romans 12:1-2) I understood the cross and that Jesus paid it ALL...and all to HIM I owe.  \n  \nJames 4: 6&10 God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble… Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.  \n  \nI asked for his forgiveness and humbled myself before him. I didn’t know what my life would start to look like, but I didn’t care. I wanted (and still do) Jesus more than I wanted anything else in this world. I finally admitted... “Hey God I can’t fight, but will you fight for me?” and HE HAS BEEN SO FAITHFUL.  \n  \nJames 4:8 Come near to God and he will come near to you.  \n  \nI can’t begin to describe how sweet life’s been since I’ve decided to join God’s team! It’s not always easy, but I’ve got the best player in the league on my team! He’s a veteran, who’s written the playbook, knows all the rules, and is undefeated. I’d also like to think of the team colors as orange and blue…like Auburn of course :)  \n  \nWhat team are you playing for? God's or the world's? You can't be on both.  \n  \nPraying for you all~"},"url":{"en-US":"victory-comes-through-brokenness"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/victory-comes-through-brokenness/"}}},

He did a great job of teaching the word, challenging our desires and making people hungry (or was that just me) with all his food analogies! I need a Mi Cocina fix now, anybody else?  \n  \nThis message really struck me concerning my desires, where my delight is and how that shows through my use of time. Ryan started off with Psalm 1:  \n<!--more-->  \n1 Blessed is the man  \nwho does not walk in the counsel of the wicked  \nor stand in the way of sinners  \nor sit in the seat of mockers.  \n2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD,  \nand on his law he meditates day and night.  \n3 He is like a tree planted by streams of water,  \nwhich yields its fruit in season  \nand whose leaf does not wither.  \nWhatever he does prospers.  \n4 Not so the wicked!  \nThey are like chaff  \nthat the wind blows away.  \n5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,  \nnor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.  \n6 For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous,  \nbut the way of the wicked will perish.  \n  \nVerse 2 describes the psalmist meditating on the law (the word of God) day and night. He yields fruit because he continues to be nourished like a tree rooted near water; his spiritual roots are strong because he fills his mind with God’s truth. Is my time used this way? Not consistently enough. What do you mediate on or what fills your time? Is it friends, food, work, hanging out at restaurants & bars, TV, movies, God’s word, running from event to event (living on someone’s schedule)? We fill our lives with things of this world. And how often are we stopping, meditating on God’s word to fill us, sustain us and genuinely trying to KNOW God? I love when Ryan said, “What you run with is what you become one with.” Isn’t that so true?  \n  \nThe biggest take away for me is seeking God alone to know Him personally and His truth. Not 2nd hand through sermons, podcasts or Christian books but allowing the Holy Spirit to work inside me through God’s word, 1st hand teaching me. God wants us to pursue Him and be totally satisfied in Him alone. Consume heavily!! Get full with Christ, feeding your spirit. A friend once told me, just like you can’t build deep friendships if you never talk to them, you can’t build a relationship with Christ if you never talk to him.  \n  \nJeremiah 29:13 “You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all of your heart.”  \n  \nPsalm 16:11 “You have made known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.”  \n  \nIf you are feeling spiritually anorexic, I pray you are asking the Lord to show you His face, teach you His ways, fill your hunger. Sit with Him, spend time with Him as you would a friend. You will find He is not only a friend; He is a lover, a Savior, a Father, a counselor, a Prince of Peace. Sit at His table with clasped hands, an open heart and the word of truth. I pray we all find satisfaction in the one true God whose “words are sweet to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!” (Psalm 119:103)  \n  \nPraying for y’all and our time tomorrow night!  \n  \nAlicia  \n  \n"},"url":{"en-US":"spiritual-anorexia"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/spiritual-anorexia/"}}},

In 2006, he released his first album _ **Speak** _, but it was his sophomore album, **_Not Without Love_** , in 2008 that really introduced Jimmy to the music scene. **_Not Without Love_** is full of bluesy-jazz sounds and beautifully-written lyrics. He wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the CD, and they all seem to tie into the idea that love is the essential factor in the Christian faith. You may have heard his song \"Forgiven and Loved\" on the radio or around Watermark; Jimmy wrote that song in response to his legalistic tendencies. In it, he speaks of trying to earn God's favor, being a Bible-beater, and focusing just on the do's and don'ts of Christianity. He realized that what he was missing from his faith was love. On his [website](http://www.jimmyneedham.com/bio.php) he states, “There is something so appealing when we love like Jesus did. I missed out on that for so long. No more. That’s what **_Not Without Love_** is all about.”  \n  \nJimmy's newest album, **_Night Lights_** , was released earlier this year and has a grittier feel to it. It is more diverse than his prior albums, even including spoken word tracks which showcase his amazing, insightful writing. While he has been compared to John Mayer and Jason Mraz, Jimmy Needham is very much his own man. He is talented in a multitude of ways and uses his talents to bring glory to God. Jimmy will definitely bless the Launch Retreat this weekend.

I hope to soak in some of that wisdom to help me with the small leaps of faith in my life.  \n  \n**Learn and Reflect**   \n  \nI’m bringing the Kindle and ditching the BlackBerry. I’ll be starting with a 4-hour car ride from Wichita Falls, and I hope to step away for some more alone time while I’m at the retreat as well.

I keep hearing about how I’m going to meet sooooo many people at this retreat.  \n  \nI want to be fully present in my conversations and hopefully make a new friend that I’ll remember hanging out with years from now.  \n  \nSee you at the Launch Retreat 2010!!"},"url":{"en-US":"launch-retreat-newbie"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/launch-retreat-newbie/"}}},

A big problem—literally! Once again the Philistines had invaded Israel, and King Saul had led the Israelite army to meet the invaders. As often happened in ancient times, a champion from one army would challenge the champion from another to decide the fate of the battle rather than have the whole armies fight and many people die. Only this time, the Philistine challenger was a giant anywhere from seven to nine feet tall! Not only that, but nobody from the Israelite army would stand up to face Goliath of Gath, even as he taunted the Israelite army and her God every day and every night for forty days. Instead they shrank back in fear.<!--more-->  \n  \nThis was not the first time that Israel had faced giants. In fact, up to this point Israel had been plagued by a fear of these giant warriors for the several hundred years since Moses led the nation out of exile in Egypt. In the 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> chapters of Numbers, we see an Israel ready to enter the Promised Land and begin the conquest of the territory that God had promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob over 400 years earlier. But before invading the land, Moses sent out twelve spies, each a leader of one of the twelve tribes of Israel, to spy out the land. When they returned, all but two of the spies gave a bad report. ![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//Facing-Your-Giants2.jpg \"Facing Your Giants2\")Yes, the land was a good land, flowing with milk, honey, wine, olive oil, and had fertile soil for farming, but they reported that the inhabitants were very strong, especially the Anakim, a race of giants and fierce warriors who lived in fortified cities. The ten spies discouraged the people, telling them that they did not think that the Israelites could win. Only Joshua and Caleb contradicted their report, saying that if God was with them they could defeat any of their enemies. The people, however, refused to heed their advice and began a rebellion against Moses, wishing to appoint a new leader to lead them back to Egypt, and to stone Moses, Joshua, and Caleb. Because of their disobedience and lack of faith in God, the Israelites were condemned to wander in the wilderness for 40 years until that generation of rebels died. Israel had failed the test and had been living in fear of giants ever since. Now several hundred years later, they were facing a similar test of faith in confronting a giant—and failing miserably.  \n  \nIsrael's problem wasn't really the giant; it was their focus. They were focused on Goliath and the Philistine army, instead of on the One who promised them victory if they were faithful to the LORD. True, Goliath was a big and daunting problem, but God and His promise of provision should have been their chief focus.  \n  \nAfter forty days of the taunting from Goliath, David, a young shepherd boy at this time, arrived on an errand from his father to deliver food to his older brothers who were fighting with the army. He heard Goliath’s taunts and mocking of Israel and her God and was furious. David finally convinced King Saul to let him fight Goliath, telling Saul “The LORD who delivered me from the lion and the bear will also deliver me from the hand of this Philistine!” (1 Sam. 17:37, NET) David had the right focus. He saw the giant just like everyone else, but was focused on the God whom that giant was taunting. As he approached Goliath with merely a sling, some stones, and a staff, the giant mocked him. David’s reply is one of the most famous in all of Scripture and plainly shows that he had a proper focus:   \n> You are coming against me with sword and spear and javelin. But I am coming against you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel’s armies, whom you have defied. This very day the Lord will deliver you into my hand! I will strike you down and cut off your head. This day I will give the corpses of the Philistine army to the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the land. Then all the land will realize that Israel has a God and all this assembly will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves! For the battle is the Lord’s, and he will deliver you into our hand. (1 Sam. 17:45-47)  \nDavid did not wait for the problem to come to him; he actively and quickly sought it out. The account in 1 Samuel 17 tells us that David ran quickly toward Goliath, slung a stone in to his sling, and nailed the giant right in the forehead. David then took Goliath’s huge sword from its sheath and, after killing him with it, cut off the giant’s head as a trophy, ending the shame he had heaped upon Israel’s army and the scorn directed at her God.  \n  \nWhat are your giants that you are facing today? Everyone has them. Everyone has skeletons in the closet that they refuse to deal with. God loves you enough that He will make you face them until you are ready to fully surrender them, and your fear of them, over to Him. It may be an addiction, a particular sin that you struggle with, or a hard relationship. Israel had always been afraid of giants and had run from them, even after God had promised them victory. God also promises you victory over temptation (1 Cor. 10:13) and that He will never leave you or forsake you (Heb. 13:5). I would encourage you to face your giants just like David did. He kept his focus on God, not the giant, and he ran quickly to confront it. Focus on Christ, not the giant in your life that you face. And run quickly to do battle with that giant, trusting the Lord to give you the victory, which, after all, will bring glory to His name.  \n  \n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"facing-your-giants"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/facing-your-giants/"}}},

After this weekend I felt really convicted of both the message last Tuesday and what we heard from Afshin. My take away in a nutshell is found in the lyrics of a song we sang this weekend…  \n  \nYOU CAN HAVE ALL THIS WORLD. JUST GIVE ME JESUS.  \n  \nWhether it’s your chase of your big boy report card (aka your paycheck)…chase of the next bigger, better, faster things this world has to offer…chase of finding that special someone so you can change your Facebook status to \"in a relationship\", \"engaged\", or \"married\"...chase of making sure you are wearing all the name-brand clothes and have the most popular friends…at the end of the day none of that matters.<!--more-->  \n  \nWhat matters is your right relationship with Christ. What matters is your understanding of the Gospel- that is the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ- and how that completely changes the way you life your life tonight, tomorrow, and all the days to come. What matters is that when you believe this truth in your heart and confess it with your mouth you are saved, and you get to leverage everything in your life for God. Your life should reflect this belief...that's what matters.  \n  \nHere are some big questions from this past week. I encourage you to spend some time really reflecting on these:  \n\n  \n- What are you doing with the things God has already entrusted you with?\n  \n- Are you living out your faith so that you do not undercut your ability to witness?\n  \n- Are you being influenced by this world or influencing this world?\n  \n- What are you doing in your life that people see and say “man he must really believe”?\n  \n  \nI 100% agree with what JP said last Tuesday “You will never feel so alive then when you allow Christ to use you.” Then Afshin said this weekend, “So often we bail out on God and we miss seeing what God has planned.” God is our greatest reward and we don’t need whatever it is that continues to take our eyes off of Him.  \n  \nTherefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

By age 18, ten of my friends had passed away. At 21, I graduated from Auburn University, and at 22 I ended up with a walker after surviving a horrific head-on collision. Married at 23, I was divorced at 24. I’d always considered myself a Christian because I grew up in a Christian home, went to church, attended camps, led Young Life, and prayed often. But just before my 26th birthday — exhausted from living on my own terms — I realized I had this ‘Christian’ thing all wrong.<!--more-->  \n  \nUntil that point I trusted in everything except the Lord: my friends, relationships, and mostly in myself. I depended on my education, physical appearance, money, guys, and social status for my self-worth (the opposite of Proverbs 3:5). That left me feeling lost, broken, numb, exhausted, and hopeless. Finally, just 18 months ago, I realized I didn’t need to make more money, get more friends, or meet another man. I needed a SAVIOR. I needed this Jesus I’d heard about my whole life. Nothing else would complete or satisfy me.  \n  \nMuch of my pain has come from me and others in my life turning our backs on God and doing what we wanted instead. Proverbs 14:12 says, “There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.” Since surrendering my life to Christ, I’ve never felt more alive, peaceful, joyful, or hopeful. I know that I am not defined by my divorce, my sins, or even anything good I’ve done; I’m defined by Christ (Ephesians 2:1-13) and what He did for me. Even when I’ve been faithless, He has been faithful (2 Timothy 2:13). God continually amazes me with His faithfulness, providing opportunities to share my story with friends, family, people in the Amazon jungle, and even my ex-husband. I’ve learned that it isn’t enough for me to just say I’m a Christian. My life must reflect that I believe in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. I’m humbled that God uses sinners like me (1 Timothy 1:12-17).  \n  \nToday, the Lord has restored and redeemed me. I was never meant to carry the bitterness, guilt, and insecurity. I’ve learned I not only can forgive others, but I can embrace the forgiveness Christ offers me as well. I’m forgiven and set free through Christ. “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come” (2 Corinthians 5:17)."},"url":{"en-US":"allys-story"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/allys-story/"}}},

Recently, I was engaged in a conversation about growth at Watermark and the need to make physical room for more people and the \"next 100\", as we like to call them, who will walk through the doors and be directed toward Christ.  \n  \nThe discussion was discouraging, to say the least, and essentially presented two negative angles. First, since the resources to build physical room for people haven't been given, why is that? Implied: Should that be taken as a sign not to proceed? Second, even if we finish out the buildings and enable our body to nearly double in the current location, what happens when we fill up again? Doesn't it seem futile since we're just going to have this problem again in the future?<!--more-->  \n  \nThose question present biblical and logical fallacies, which I can hopefully quickly address before hitting the real point. First, if we look at Scripture and particularly the Old Testament where God ordained a number of buildings, we see times where the structure stood incomplete due to lack of will and/or funds (2 Kings 12:4ff; Haggai 1:2ff). When this happened, the answer wasn't to give up or resign, but rather to redouble the people's action and call them to wholehearted commitment. Second, if we follow the logic of eventually maximizing our current location, we would never have started in the first place. Yes, the project is big. Yes, the structure is large. But so is the city we are striving to reach with the live-saving truth of Christ! We will spread out; we will end up in other locations; but let us not abandon potential where we have it...  \n  \nNow for the real point. Perhaps this is more about my generation (X/Y) or maybe it's the 21st century church as a whole, but we have a split-brain dilemma in our attachments to the local body (a.k.a. our home churches). I'm the first to confess that up until this week, I was the chief of this inconsistency. I've poured my life (read: time) into Watermark for the past 14 months, but my financial commitment has been token--the safe, 10% tithe that soothes the conscience. Week in, week out, I'll burn the midnight oil, over-commit, and literally use every waking hour in the service of ministries I believe in at Watermark. Yet the roof under which I spend so much time, and which is often the source of problems (capacity or traffic-flow), I neglect.  \n  \nHow did I get away with this flawed, inconsistent commitment for so long? If I go to Acts (2:42ff; 4:32ff; 6:3ff), the Word tells me of a church wholly invested with both time and resources--they were continually devoting themselves (time) and not claiming anything as their own (resources). So what was my hang up? Well, I'm an analyst and critic by nature and I saw deficiencies at Watermark, places where I believe things should be done differently or where I think they do not aspire high enough. So what was my response? Hold back part of my heart. Give my time, sure, but save those precious dollars for that perfect ministry in the future where it'll be clear that I should go \"all in\" for God. That's ridiculous--there are no perfect ministries. And if I see room for growth, why not strive to make it happen? But that was me.  \n  \nSo here I stand. On top of my own brokenness, I say, \"Go all in!\" If you regularly feed at a local body of believers (read: the place you go each Sunday), don't hold back your heart. Maybe you're the opposite--you write a generous check every month, but your time goes elsewhere. Reconcile your balance sheet. If a place is worth your money, it's probably worth your time (and vice versa). If it isn't, put your resources in a place worthy of the life God's given you. If you see problems at your church, welcome to the club and step in further. This club isn't for passive critics; it's for those who see (and are) imperfect people running toward a perfect God and who need each other in the race. Paul didn't \"fight the good fight\" and \"finish the course\" of his life by holding back in his commitment to the church (2 Tim. 4:7). He poured himself out as a \"drink offering\" and suffered much for individual churches (2 Tim. 4:6; 1 Thess. 2).  \n  \nWherever you are, in whatever church you are in, be all there. It's worth it. Pray, serve, give. Go all in."},"url":{"en-US":"thanks-for-wait-theres-no-room-for-me"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/thanks-for-wait-theres-no-room-for-me/"}}},

It was a tough day to say the least. Two years prior to that, the doctors had found early traces of the cancer and we all thought that it had been found early enough and that everything would be OK. Unfortunately, they gave him medicine that sped up the growth of the cancer instead of killing it in its infancy. In his mid 70's my grandpa was a very strong guy (how many men that age do you know that are still building churches with their bare hands?) and was about 6'1\". When we came up to visit him that Thanksgiving, the cancer had attacked him so severely that he had shriveled up to less than 5' and probably weighed around 100 lbs. It was hard to look at him and not shudder in horror at what cancer can do to the human body, not to mention someone in your family.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy grandpa was an amazing man. He fits the description perfectly of a \"Greatest Generation\" guy: he grew up in the Depression with his dad abandoning him, his siblings and mom, joined the Navy at 18 to fight the Japanese in the South Pacific in WWII, went to college on the GI Bill after the War, was an all star 3rd baseman, and would have gone pro had he not blown out his knee. Instead, he spent the rest of his career defending the U.S. from the Soviet Union in missile defense and space technology. More importantly he was also a devoted follower of Jesus for most of his adult life, having come to know Christ at one of Billy Graham’s earlier Crusades out in Oregon in the early ‘50’s. I was very close with him and had a tremendous amount of respect for him personally, as well as for his walk with Christ and knowledge of the Bible.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat Thanksgiving we went to the hospice building where he had been staying for the last several months or so. Anyone who is familiar with the hospice system knows that several months is a pretty long time to be there, because it's a place you go for a short time to die comfortably. We were there visiting with him and my grandma for most of the day. As we were heading out to go back to the airport, my grandma yelled for us to come back because he was praying. We all were standing around the bedside and were straining to hear what he was saying because he could really only mumble due to the fact that the cancer had basically destroyed all the muscles in his throat. Then, all of a sudden as clear as day, his voice returned to normal for one sentence of the prayer: \"I pray that Kyle and Conner (my younger brother) would grow strong in the Lord.\" After that he went right back to mumbling. At the same instant we all looked up at each other wide-eyed and in shock at what had just happened. At that moment it felt like I hit a brick wall and we all started crying our eyes out. In fact, it was the first time I had ever seen my Dad cry. I think I was dragged out of the room because I was such a wreck.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen we got to the car and started driving back to the airport, I lost it. I was so angry with God, that I started yelling at Him. How could such a good God allow someone to die in this terrible way, especially one who had dedicated most of his life to following him?! How could He do this to my family? After a little bit I calmed down and started to process it all. I started thinking about my grandpa, how, even going through this horrible dying experience, never complained once, yet actually thanked God every day for everything that He had given him and for giving him strength to honor Him in this last part of his life. He even was telling the nurses at the facility about Jesus! My grandpa had such peace, and it was incomprehensible to me. I then asked myself the question, \"If that was me in his position, would I have the peace and trust in God that he had?\" The answer was \"obviously not\". Though I had come to know Jesus when I was 5 years old, I did not really know who He was and certainly didn't have any interest to pursue Him further. I went to church every Sunday but was missing the whole point. God didn't want my attendance; He wanted my whole heart and a personal relationship. As I thought about this, it was as if God was saying to me, \"Kyle, I have given you so much and I even died on the cross for you. What are you doing? You call yourself a Christian and yet what is so different about your life from someone else's who doesn't know Me?\" Obviously I didn't hear an audible voice from God, but it might as well have been a megaphone right next to my ear. I recognized right there that I was not walking with the Lord and confessed that to Him and rededicated my life to Him and told Him I wanted the peace and the relationship with Him that my grandpa had.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt's been almost 12 years since that happened and I look back on that day as one of the toughest, yet sweetest days of my life. Nothing magical happened at that moment like angels singing or anything like that, but God did start working on my heart immediately. I had never had a desire to read the Bible, yet somehow I couldn't put it down. I had never had a desire to tell others about Jesus, yet I had this desire all of a sudden to tell people about Jesus' love for them. Though that was over a decade ago, the beautiful thing about a relationship with the living God is that the story doesn’t end when you come to know Him; it just begins. I'm living proof that if you humbly come to God and seek to know Him, He will reveal Himself to you and that you too can have a personal relationship with Him."},"url":{"en-US":"kyles-testimony"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/kyles-testimony/"}}},

Watermark Young Adults ([www.theporchdallas.com](http://theporch.wpengine.com/)) just got home from an amazing three-day weekend of worship, fellowship, prayer, praise, and many fun activities. Afshin Ziafat, the pastor for the weekend, shared the story of Abraham and Isaac. Abraham had a promise made to him by God that his descendants would outnumber the stars and that his people would be blessed through these descendants, well…Abraham was reaching an age that he and his wife were not going to have children (in their 90’s), so Abraham takes it upon himself to “help” God out when he decided to sleep with his maidservant and have a child (because God obviously forgot his promise to him, right?). Long story short, God blessed Abraham and Sarah with a son named Isaac, and through Abraham and Isaac we have the lineage of our Savior Jesus Christ.<!--more-->  \n  \nMy favorite part of the sermon was where Afshin helped me realize that we mimic Abraham to some degree. We make a conscious decision that God is clueless to His blessings for us, so we proceed to take matters into our own hands. Whether it’s a job, a relationship, a marriage…or fill in the blank! Well, about seven years ago, I was a soon-to-be-graduate of college; I had an amazing girlfriend at that time, and I decided to take matters into my own hands and ask for her hand in marriage. (Side-note: I knew God was semi-involved or I would not have proceeded.) I was convicted to share this story because I was reading in Nehemiah 2 this morning and found the brilliance in the prayer that paves the way for a decision, especially a big decision. The King noticed that something was wrong with Nehemiah, and upon questioning he found out Nehemiah was sad because Nehemiah himself was a leader in the Persian Empire, but his family’s homeland (Jerusalem) was desolate. So when the King asked Nehemiah what he wanted…Nehemiah THEN prayed before answering the King. What if we followed suit and realized that sometimes OUR KING wants us to pray before we make a decision, big or small. Unlike Abraham, who took matters into his own hands before God fulfilled His own promises via Abraham and Sarah’s true son Isaac. I’ve noticed myself weighing the pros and cons of a decision without consulting God; have you? I encourage you to find Scripture to base your decision on, then get with wise counsel and seek out wisdom on that decision.  \n  \nGod can still bless a broken path that you made for yourself. I know this because I ended up marrying the young lady I spoke of earlier. We were married a short one-and-a-half years before my life was rocked by the confession of an affair. I did not know what to do, except to love her. Marital love forgives, it understands, it does not easily anger, and it presses on in difficult times. Was I perfect in my love to her? By no means could I claim that. I learned a lot about “love languages” post-affair and tried to emulate what the book taught me, but I was a little too late. I learned about making more deposits in a love bank than debits. I learned of the “platinum” rule…a leap beyond what the golden rule states. The platinum rule says that I will treat others the way that THEY WANT to be treated. I might not understand why a certain love language speaks love to someone, but by all means…I will sacrifice my own understanding in order to demonstrate a love that the other person understands. Another year and a multitude of circumstances out of my control led my ex-wife to leave our home and start over on her own with a new person. It was devastating. I didn’t know how to cope, except to turn to family and friends and ultimately God.  \n  \nI knew as time went by that God was in control. I continued my prayers for my ex-wife because I knew her heart was out of control during our divorce. She was openly apologetic and sought my forgiveness – which she had from day one. It was a blessing to see her get back on track in her walk with Christ and another blessing for her to let me know that she was refocusing on the woman she was the day I asked her to marry me (ultimately a sign that seeds planted during our divorce were coming to fruition). I cannot say that I regret my circumstances because I have learned more in those 2.5 years than I would have learned otherwise. God has readied my heart to follow closely to Him, seek Him, love Him, and keep Him at the center of my focus. My life, at the end of the day, revolves around Christ and the power of His resurrection and forgiveness of my sins. Much like Abraham felt the glory of God when he and Sarah bore Isaac to the world, I feel the glory of God as I passionately pursue Him and bear Christ to the world. I hope you know that it is difficult to passionately pursue God until you realize that He is passionately pursing you!  \n  \nThanks for reading into my heart at a deeper level. I know that many people, unfortunately, have been through a divorce or some other heartache that can and should be used as a stepping stone towards the cross and the abundant life promised by our creator. Never forget that God has your best interest at heart, and that is something to be joyful about. That being said…  \n  \n\" **<sup>2</sup>** Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, **<sup>3</sup>** because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. **<sup>4</sup>** Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.\" ~James 1:2-4 (NIV)  \n  \n\" **<sup>6</sup>** Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. **<sup>7</sup>** And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\" ~Philippians 4:6-7 (NIV)"},"url":{"en-US":"consider-it-joy"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/consider-it-joy/"}}},

The trip was more than I ever imagined it could be! Below are some brief notes about the incredible journey through Manaus and the Amazon:  \n  \n[![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//Amazon-1.jpg \"Amazon 1\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/2010/09/best-trip-of-my-life-amazon-2010/amazon-1/)  \n  \n\\*MANAUS (the city)- The outdoor markets in Manaus were filled with culture. There was music, dance contests… and I bought a coconut to drink while shopping. :)  \n  \n\\*OUR PARTNER CHURCH- The Presbyterian Church in Manaus was packed with believers singing worship and praise in Portuguese. It was moving to see people worshiping our same God in another part of the world and in another language! (Revelation 7:9-17)  \n<!--more-->  \n[![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//Amazon-2.jpg \"Amazon 2\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/2010/09/best-trip-of-my-life-amazon-2010/amazon-2/)  \n  \n\\*OUR BOAT- was 3 stories with the kitchen and a few rooms on the bottom level (mine was there). Our dining room/hangout/guy's bedroom was on the second level along with a few more rooms for the girls. The top level was just an open hang out area where we could watch the MOST BEAUTIFUL sunsets and sunrises I have ever seen in my life. The stars at night would completely cover the sky in a way I’ve never seen and because of our location the moon would disappear.  \n  \n[![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//Amazon-3.jpg \"Amazon 3\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/2010/09/best-trip-of-my-life-amazon-2010/amazon-3/)  \n  \n\\*LONG JOURNEY- It took us 18 hours on the boat to get to our first village. Hints why they call the people of the Amazon the “Forgotten People” because it takes so long for anyone to get out to where they live.  \n  \n[![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//Amazon-4.jpg \"Amazon 4\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/2010/09/best-trip-of-my-life-amazon-2010/amazon-4/)  \n  \n\\*THE RIVER- We were on the Rio Negro River. The water was like glass…wake boarders/skiers seriously the smoothest water I have ever seen in my life. The water created a perfect reflection of the land, clouds, sunsets/rises, and even lightning. It was breathtaking.  \n  \n\\*THE VILLAGES- The villages we went to were small, around 10-30 families in each. Women on average have 3 children by the time they are 25-27 years old (my age). Men fished and hunted; one even speared a jaguar a couple days before we reached their village. Women would work in fields and take care of the children. Many children also attended a small school in their village.  \n  \n[![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//Amazon-5.jpg \"Amazon 5\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/2010/09/best-trip-of-my-life-amazon-2010/amazon-5/)  \n  \n\\*OUR TEAMS- We had a medical team, women’s team, men’s team, and children’s team. The people would line up to get medical help and even medicine from a pharmacy we had on our boat. The women’s team would paint nails to open conversation, go to their homes to help cook or just meet them, and have afternoon meetings to share testimonies, share the Gospel, pray, and give them goody bags with everyday toiletries. The men played soccer, went on jungle tours, got to know the men, and shared testimonies, etc. The children’s team would play games, do a VBS, sing songs, and act out skits of Bible stories, etc. They worked so hard! At the end of the day we would have a church service where one or two of us would share our testimonies and then one of the leaders would give a message. We also were lucky that a guy on our team, Justin, brought his guitar with him so we did worship on our boat during devos and in the villages as well!  \n  \n [![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//Amazon-6.jpg \"Amazon 6\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/2010/09/best-trip-of-my-life-amazon-2010/amazon-6/)  \n  \n\\*RESULTS- I am not sure how many people were “saved”, but seeds were definitely planted and we left encouraged. Many had a wrong view of the Gospel, so we had the opportunity to share with them the TRUTH and the Good News! We shared a lot, prayed a lot, smiled a lot, and even cried. Lives were changed…both theirs and ours.  \n  \n\\*FUN FUN FUN- Some fun things we got to experience: jungle hikes, picking pineapples, canoe tours, swimming with dolphins in the river, an alligator hunt(!), fishing, touring incredible hotels in Manaus (including one with a zoo), and eating amazing Brazilian food!  \n  \n [![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//Amazon-7.jpg \"Amazon 7\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/2010/09/best-trip-of-my-life-amazon-2010/amazon-7/)  \n  \n\\*THANK YOU GOD- Three of us actually got baptized on this trip. Kylea, Kiersti, and myself. I was actually baptized as a baby, but this was different. I truly understand and believe the Gospel now, and the fact that in being reconciled to Christ I am a new creation. The old has gone, the new has come! (2 Corinthians 5, Romans 6, Matthew 28, Acts 2:38) JP, our young adults pastor, did all three of our baptisms. God has used him in all our walks, and he has spoken so much truth to us that we all were so grateful he would agree to baptize us in the Amazon River. It was INCREDIBLE! Thankfully none of us were bitten by anything during the process! :)  \n  \n[![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//Amazon-8.jpg \"Amazon 8\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/2010/09/best-trip-of-my-life-amazon-2010/amazon-8/)  \n  \n\\*REFLECTION- I learned so much about sharing the Gospel and praying for people in the moment. You know how people tell you something and you tell them you will pray for them? I’ve learned not to wait, but to pray right then. It’s amazing. The people taught me so much about living simply, being content, and realizing I already have more than I ever need. The joy of the Brazilians that served with us was contagious, I pray that I can be that way! To many of us the trip made God seem so huge that He could reach so far and so many languages, but at the same time be so small that He wants each and every one of us. I am truly humbled at the opportunity I was given to serve HIM and make HIM known.  \n  \n[![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//Amazon-9.jpg \"Amazon 9\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/2010/09/best-trip-of-my-life-amazon-2010/amazon-9/)"},"url":{"en-US":"best-trip-of-my-life-amazon-2010"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/best-trip-of-my-life-amazon-2010/"}}},

YOU CAN HOPE IN ME. AND I LOVE YOU. ~God  \n  \nAndrew from Broken Voices gave an awesome message last week (9/7) about Christ being the center of our lives. Definitely go back and [listen online](http://www.watermarkradio.com/index.php?id=153&channel=543&series=174&message=0) if you missed it.  \n  \n“So many of us are never all in on anything because of situations we’ve been through. We all have this trust problem, and so we often become one foot in and one foot out” (Revelation 3:15-17). How silly is it that we would even begin to compare the faithfulness of people in our lives to that of our God (Leviticus 19), our Creator (Psalm 139), our Savior (1 Timothy 4)? Of course people in our lives are going to let us down. We are all a little broken , a little selfish, and a lot sinful. Heck, we even let ourselves down. There are times where the more we try to control situations because of our own desires the more out of control things get. We add stress and carry burdens that we were never meant to have. <!--more-->  \n  \nMatthew 11:28-30, \"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\"  \n  \nI love when Andrew said, “When the center is off, it’s only a matter of time before everything falls apart.” There was a moment in my life where I had everything I thought I needed to be happy. I had the job, the car, the home, the husband, and the dog. The only thing missing was Christ at the center of my life. In just a short amount of time all of that was gone. Everything I had hoped and prayed for and thought to be the most important things in life were gone. The problem the whole time was that I did the same thing Romans 1:25 speaks on: “They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.” Thankfully God is mighty to save, restore, and redeem. He rescued me from myself and drew me close to Him.  \n  \nMy desire is now isn't for the car, home, husband, or job. My desire is that \"when I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have one single bit of talent left and could say... I used everything you gave me\". You see my life and your life isn’t meant to get as much as we can, it’s meant to give as much as we can, and to serve our Savior who has given his life for us so that we may have eternal life(John 3:16)!!!  \n  \n“Our lives were meant to move an off-centered world closer to being back on center.” ~Andrew (Broken Voices)  \n  \nWhat is at the center of your life?

They would be getting ahead in the career game while I would have to squat for the next six weeks when going to the bathroom. Despite my attitude, my time in Asia was a huge growing experience and my flight home was definitely different than my flight over. So what did I learn in between those flights and where does that leave me now four years later? Read on to find out…  \n  \n<!--more--> **Finding a New Worldview**  \n  \nThere comes a point when you spend enough time with someone that differences fade away, the awkwardness dissipates, and you begin to understand who they are. As I spent days, weeks, and months with the people in that city I started to see their world view and the similarities in our walks of life. It was in those similarities that we began to build our relationships.  \n  \nI started there as a foreigner. I soon found myself as a guest. And I left as a brother. I think people have so much in common in this broken world. If we just look past our [differences](http://donmilleris.com/2010/08/12/does-church-teach-us-to-view-peoples-differences/), we can begin a relationship on a common ground. God created us to be in community, and sometimes we just need to get out of our own way to find it.  \n  \n**Changing My Lenses**  \n  \nIn Asia I made the distinction for the first time that I needed to change the direction of my ambition and drive. Being plucked out of the business school bubble opened my eyes to a world I was completely ignoring in my pursuit of the American Dream. Seeing poverty, corruption, and a suicide 10 feet from where I stood shocked me out of my inward thinking.  \n  \nMy time in Asia forced me to look at the world around me. I found a lot of pain everywhere I went and with everyone I talked to. We live in a world where we’re starving for examples of real love. I think many of us are starving emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually because we don’t express and experience what love truly is. On my flight back across the ocean, I had a renewed sense of the heart of Christ and how He modeled a way to lay down our lives in the service of others.  \n  \n**Reverse Culture Shock**  \n  \nComing home was weird. I developed an acute sense of living standards by just sitting on a toilet. Unfortunately, the thing about shock is that it goes away. Over time, the things that I found almost repulsive slowly became part of the norm of my everyday life. I became numb to it.  \n  \nWriting this post was a good reminder for me. What did I learn? [Does it still apply?](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/2010/08/climbing-up-the-popularity-i-mean-corporate-ladder/) How can I re-orient my life based on the life-lessons that God taught me back then? A [mentor](http://www.theendofreligion.org/About_Bruxy.html) of mine once made the distinction between head-memory and life-memory. I may not remember all the details of what happened in Asia, but what I do in my life should reflect the wisdom I gained in those six weeks. As I'm thinking through lessons learned, I should accompany that with some kind of action within my life.  \n  \nWhen I meet someone, am I looking past our differences to find a common ground to build a meaningful relationship? Am I seeking out opportunities to emulate the love that Jesus modeled for me? Am I spending less on myself in order to give more to those in need? The next steps for me are not really to continue remembering what happened in Asia, but to continually adapt my life to reflect that memory and the lessons I learned.  \n  \nGoing on missions is just as beneficial to you as the people you go to serve. I would encourage anyone that is interested in checking out more about missions to attend one of the following info sessions at Watermark. Even now, I'm still taking away lessons from what I learned four years ago on the other side of the world.  \n  \n• Tuesday, September 28th @ 8:30-9:15 PM (after Porch in West Community Room)  \n• Tuesday, October 5th @ 8:30-9:15 PM (after Porch in West Community Room)"},"url":{"en-US":"mission-trip-to-asia"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/mission-trip-to-asia/"}}},

I have been going to Guatemala for the past three years to the same village of Rio Hondo with a team of 60 people to help put together a week-long vacation Bible study for about 500 kids, teenagers, and adults. This is the one week of the year that these kids look forward to. It’s like Christmas to them. For the first two years I have been a leader for the smaller children, led them in different activities and enjoyed their smiling faces, their hugs and sweet affection. Pictures are taken and serve as reminders of their smiling faces until I return.  \n  \nSince I am one of the few that speaks Spanish in the group, I really wanted to work with the teenagers this year and be able to speak to the girls who are at such a crucial age in their lives. As I talked to them I could see there was so much more there than just a smiling face. Most had experienced things that many adults will never see or experience.<!--more-->  \n  \nEven though most of them are constantly making jokes, laughing and making fun of each other, I could still see the wall and the mask that they each wear. Easily retracting if there was even a hint of talking about anything personal or serious. I felt at times that they were not listening to me, they were easily distracted. I could see so much of myself within them.  \n  \nWhat I discovered this year was the pain behind each of those beautiful smiles. There is major poverty in Guatemala that can easily be seen as you walk through the village. However, beyond the poverty, this year the Lord showed me more of the bondage of sin that exists here. My heart truly broke as I stared at the ugly face of sin and the bondage that these children, teenagers, adults are under. However, I know that this does not only exist here but all over the world – in our daily lives.  \n  \nThis verse kept coming to mind more and more throughout the week:   \n  \n _“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms” Ephesians 6:12_  \n  \nI have been building these relationships that have grown over the last three years. Each year, I’ve learned more and more of their individual stories – proving to be more shocking and eye-opening than the last. This year, I also gave my testimony in front of the entire village and it was an amazing experience. With the sharing of my testimony I had several teenagers come to me afterward and in separate occasions share their life stories with me.  \n  \nThese next things that I am going to share are what broke my heart the most during my time in Rio Hondo. They are hard to write and to read but I’m including because it is the reality of what these kids face – what people all over the world face. We often times forget these things in our comforts, our busy lives, our distractions. There are so many people suffering, and we (I) so easily forget…  \n  \nI received a beautiful hand written note from one of the teenage girls. In it she wrote how much she appreciated that I taught them about forgiveness and Christ’s love. She said she carried a lot of anger and resentment in her heart from the murder of her brother.    \n  \nThere was a teenage boy that came up to me shortly after I spoke on Friday night. He told me that he had experienced some pretty terrible things in his life and that he has so much hate and depression as a result and that he often times thought about killing himself. He proceeded to tell me that he had been sexually abused by not just one person but a group of older guys. Guys that were currently in the crowd and whom I had just spoken to. He had his head in his hands and said he was so ashamed.  \n  \nI received a call from another teenager a few days later who told me that he often times thought about killing himself and was planning on doing so the Friday before we got there. He told me that he used to break bottles and cut himself.  \n  \nLord, what do I do with all of this? How can I hear these things and just leave now? The face of Sin is so ugly and the brokenness is so rampant. When it is exposed we see the true death that it causes. You see, we often times measure sin by how big or small _we_ think it is, without realizing that it all goes to the same pot… adding more and more to the world’s sin that continues through generations.  \n  \nA lot to process in such a short amount of time. I’m left feeling like I just woke up from a dream that is unfortunately reality. I know that I must continue to arm myself with His word because times are only getting worse. There is an urgency to save those who are lost, to share hope in this fallen world. We live in a blessed nation and with this we have the responsibility to share His love and bind up the brokenhearted one village at a time.  \n  \n_\"The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that He might be glorified.\"_  \n  \n  \n<object id=\"vp14S0iA\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"432\" height=\"240\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\">\n<param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\">\n<param name=\"src\" value=\"http://static.animoto.com/swf/w.swf?w=swf/vp1&amp;e=1279869400&amp;f=4S0iACp9PdDM6xmEa3QkjQ&amp;d=302&amp;m=b&amp;r=w&amp;i=m&amp;options=\">\n<param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\">\n<embed id=\"vp14S0iA\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"432\" height=\"240\" src=\"http://static.animoto.com/swf/w.swf?w=swf/vp1&amp;e=1279869400&amp;f=4S0iACp9PdDM6xmEa3QkjQ&amp;d=302&amp;m=b&amp;r=w&amp;i=m&amp;options=\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>"},"url":{"en-US":"thoughts-from-guatemala-basking-in-his-presence"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/thoughts-from-guatemala-basking-in-his-presence/"}}},

HE WANTS YOU TO BE A WONDER TO A WORLD THAT WATCHES DEATH RULE EVERYWHERE, BUT LIFE INCREASE IN YOU.”  \n  \nHave you ever felt like you had one foot in the world and one foot with Christ? Maybe going out and partying on the weekend, but showing up for church Sunday? Possibly going to The Porch Tuesday, and then dating someone you know you shouldn’t or having inappropriate relationships? Or maybe it’s even going to church, and then doing whatever it takes to make more money, more success, more popularity including lying, backstabbing, cheating, and joining into inappropriate conversations throughout the week? During this time did you ever get frustrated because it seemed like relationships with friends, dating, co-workers were more difficult? Did life seem confusing, hard, and painful?<!--more-->  \n  \nTodd gave an awesome message last Tuesday and shared with us Matthew 6:19-24. I encourage you to go back and listen as well as reflect on these verses. Scripture clearly tells us “No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money (you can enter anything you constantly think about here).” –Matthew 6:24  \n  \nI loved when Todd said, “Judgments of sin is just the fruits of sin. God doesn’t bring chaos into your life because you chose to sin…sin is the chaos.”  \n  \nFor a while I would get mad at God when bad things happened in my life. I just didn’t understand why he would allow bad things to happen if he loved me. Now living in the light and having “good eyes” I can clearly see that the pain and hurt in my life came from the sin, not from God. It came from me or someone else disobeying the Lord, and often from me pushing my agenda instead of trusting in the Lords. It came from me and/or others not being fully surrendered to Christ. God is trying to rip us off from happiness, he is trying to set us free and protect us. I agree with Todd saying, “I have never listened to Him & followed Him where I lived to regret it.”  \n  \n\"Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.\" –Romans 8:1-2  \n  \nMy other idol in life besides God was relationships. I’d knowingly settle just to have that attention from a guy, but God has restored that area of my life. He has redeemed me. A guy is no longer my desire or treasure, the Lord is and He has my heart.  \n  \nQuotes from Todd: “If you attract a guy with looks, you’ll lose him the same way.” “Scripture encourages you to find someone who is not just professing the love of Christ, but showing you.” Proverbs 31:30  \n  \nUndone ~ [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z8Efykeiis&NR=1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z8Efykeiis&NR=1)"},"url":{"en-US":"be-a-wonder-to-the-world"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/be-a-wonder-to-the-world/"}}},

JP made a good point, where should God start then? Should he start with murderers, liars, cheaters, or maybe even with us?

Then tears of joy come when I think of how the Lord loves us, is patient with us, forgives us, and even wants to use us to help build his kingdom. We are called to be ambassadors for Christ (2 Corinthians 5:20), bearing witness to those around us. Sharing what we know to be true and the good news that HE IS COMING BACK! We know how this is going to end.  \n  \nIf you’ve met me you know how much I love football, Auburn football more specifically, but as silly as this seems I’ve been asking myself this question and want to ask you as well….I plan my weekends around when Auburn is playing, have my jersey on, chat with everyone who will listen to me about the game, learn stats, and cheer way too much, but am I that way about Christ? Do I plan for His coming again, share with everyone who will listen, know and share his Word that is Truth, and give God all the glory and praise for everything in my life? Am I more excited about football than Christ? Are you? Or maybe it’s something else you’re passionate about, but why aren't we that much more excited and passionate about the Gospel and truth that Christ is coming again?  \n  \nI was at lunch not too long ago and overheard a child in a booth next to me talking about Jesus to his family. He said... \"I want to be alive when he comes back!...We've got to tell everybody he's coming!\" He was so excited. Those two little sentences from a child were such a great reminder for me.

There were a couple times he even called us out saying, “we are takers, we can’t see past ourselves…it’s all about ‘me’.” I hate even thinking about that because I know how painfully true that statement is.

All these situations are little experiments seeing what I can do for myself. Most of the time I’ve done this because it’s things that I want and has nothing to do with God’s plan for my life or in any way trusting in Him. During these times I am also not following what God has said is true and am not believing that these truth’s are written to protect us because He loves us.

Reflect on your life, how much time are you spending trying to make your will happen? How much time are you spending getting to know your Creator, your Savior, your Heavenly Father?

Maybe it's even the simple question of asking the person sitting next to you now, or the next person you see...\"Hey, how are you doing today? Is there anything I can pray for you about?\" Then listen and pray. Try it and I'd love to hear how God uses those small gestures of love and kindness.  \n  \nI pray that we not be selfish young adults here in Dallas, but we would be selfless.  \n  \nI encourage you all to spend some quiet time today reflecting on these verses: 1 John 3:16-20, Romans 12:1-3, Philippians 2:1-11."},"url":{"en-US":"its-all-about-me"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/its-all-about-me/"}}},

I’d read his book ([Crazy Love](http://www.crazylovebook.com/)), even heard bits and pieces of audio from him, but I held my skepticism. It wasn’t that I didn’t think he loved the Lord.

I felt cautious of jumping onto the [Francis Chan](http://www.catalystspace.com/catablog/full/francis_chan_is_stepping_out_in_faith/) crazy bandwagon.

I like it when I hear a man speak from a deep place of truth that is not dependent upon himself, but in the rawest sense of the Lord’s strength. He had no magic pill or formulaic answers to life. He just read what we all have access to every day of our lives and shared of how he is learning to live it. He lost his place, forgot what he was going to say, and yet still continued to speak with power.  \n  \n**At the end he spoke of how this was not about him.** This was not about what people said or didn’t say about him. This wasn’t what we thought or didn’t think about him. This was simply about the Bible, and what the Bible said of loving the lost and poor and orphaned and widowed. And then he sat down.  \n  \nAs the program was wrapping up the closer of the night said a quick shout out thanking Francis for sharing, and asked that we thank him. People clapped. And then they kept clapping… and clapping…. and standing and clapping… and I did a slow cringe inside my soul.  \n  \n**We’d missed it. The minute we stood to stand and clap for Francis Chan, we missed it.** We missed everything he had said. We were applauding the message, and the speaker. We were living in that moment of feel good and I want to change the world and feed the homeless. But we weren’t living outside of this moment. We weren’t stopping to see God in it and what he was calling to us. We were applauding a man and his message, and a little part of my heart died at our human depravity.  \n  \nWe miss it all too easily.  \n  \n**We miss the maker of this earth and instead choose to praise the made in front of us.**   \n  \nWe miss it every day, and I’m tired of missing it.  \n  \n**What have you been missing lately?** "},"url":{"en-US":"missing-the-moment"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/missing-the-moment/"}}},

Lack of communication can cause so much pain and confusion in our lives whether at work, with family/friends, and in relationships. Recently I was thinking about how lack of communication can hurt more than just hearing the truth. I can only imagine how God must feel when we continually chose to ignore him and not communicate. Maybe you don’t feel like you can pray to God because you aren’t sure he’s really there and listening or you don’t know what or how to pray. I’ve been there.  \n  \nThere was a point in my life where I wasn’t honestly communicating with anyone. I didn’t let anyone know the truth about how sad and broken I was, including God. The Lord used JP to share with me the Gospel, and used him to encourage me about how our Father wants a relationship with us no matter how broken we are, or how many times we’ve turned our backs on Him. I remembering not really knowing what or how to pray, but just praying to God that I needed help, I need Jesus Christ as my Savior, and wanted a relationship with Him. The Lord totally answered, and has continued to as I've been in relationship with Him.  \n  \nYou see God is faithful even when we are faithless.(2 Timothy 2:13) God doesn’t ignore us, even though we’ve ignore Him and others (Matthew 22:37-39). A relationship with Christ gives you more than any other relationship can. The Lord saves! Restores! Redeems! Gives you peace, mercy, joy, and grace! I love when JP said, “Sometimes people don't have a right relationship with God, but want him to be their magician” and just fix things or give things. True faith is the belief in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and having a relationship with Him. Trusting that even when things may not make sense, He may be doing something bigger than you. Praising Him in good times and bad, and giving Him all the glory.  \n  \nHow’s your prayer life? Your Father loves you and would love to chat :)  \n  \nPraying you will know the Lord and that He will know you.

The area of my life I’ve struggled with the most to be honest. As much as I hate to admit it, I have settled many times in my life because of the desire to have someone around. (2 Corinthians 6:14) I can tell you first-hand that it is far better to be single than in an unhealthy relationship/marriage. My loneliest time, in fact, was being in a marriage that was not Christ-centered and was completely broken.  \n  \nI loved it when JP talked about how our time of singleness can be either a waste of time, or the most productive time. It’s hard to even think about the amount of time I’ve wasted in my life worrying about dating. Since surrendering my life to Christ, it has been amazing to see how God has worked in that area of my life. By focusing more on my relationship with God and less on relationships with guys, I’ve been able to build great relationships with my girl friends, serve here at The Porch, take Bible studies to work through areas of my life that I needed to deal with, and even go to the Amazon Jungle on a mission trip! This time of singleness has allowed God to restore me, sharpen me, and better prepare me for a relationship, if that is in His will. God has blessed my life more than any boyfriend ever could! (1 Corinthians 7:35)  \n  \nSpending time with the Lord in my singleness has definitely helped to make purity a priority, greatly increased my discernment, and has shown me that when things don’t work out with someone, I can have peace knowing that I have no regrets and the Lord has something greater planned for my life (Romans 8:28). I am not defined by the guy I am with or if I have one at all, I am defined by Jesus Christ. I pray that my faithfulness marks me.  \n  \nLadies:  \n\"She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue… Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.\" ~Proverbs 31:25-26, 30  \n  \nGentlemen:  \n\"Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 3not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money… (They) are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.

It seems simple enough. It even seems logical. Once you believe there is a God and start to understand who He is, why wouldn’t you follow the Lord? He has so much to offer. Love, provisions, comfort, rest, peace, and lots of blessings.  \n  \nBlessings and blessing and blessings.  \n  \nBeing a girly girl, I have those moments of turning on my “daughter” charm and wanting to figure out ways to ask my earthly father for things he can give that I want. Wish I could say this has never happened with the Lord but, let's be honest, it happens much more with Him!  \n  \nHow often I will sit there and think, “oh, and God if You could do that too, that would be great!” “Speaking of blessings, I would love for You to provide this opportunity.” I mean isn’t there that verse that says, \"Ask and you will receive?\"<!--more-->  \n  \nRecently, though, I have been shocked how my mentality can so easily get skewed just a little, but enough to have a huge impact on my approach to the Lord. I have developed an “if I do this….then You will give me that…” mentality. Part of that is how much of life around us works. Newton said it best, “for every action there is a reaction.”  \n  \nBut when Newton said that I don’t think he was thinking of God. God has managed to remain outside the laws of physics…but then I shouldn’t be surprised by that. God provides blessings because He can, not because I did something. Too often I take ownership and think it is my doing that the Lord blesses me. This theology on God is all well when everything is going good in life. The blessings are then a self-righteous way for me to applaud myself for “doing good” and that is why these blessings have happened.  \n  \nBut what happens when everything turns south? God even promises hard times, so then what? Did I do something wrong? Possibly…but not necessarily. Remember the story of Job? So, now I’ve developed this self-worth not on who God is, but on what I did. I measured my self-worth in blessings. I pursued the Lord because of what He could give me.  \n  \nI have stopped running after God, and instead run after what having God in my life can give me.  \n  \nI find myself starting to strive to find the perfect combination to take me back to all those blessings. If I read my Bible every day. If I start to memorize verses. If I feed the homeless. If I serve at church. If I give money away.  \n  \nSometimes it is in visible ways, but then other times it is in those internal ways no one can really see.  \n  \nIf I “love” the Lord more. If I pray harder. If I become humble. If I confess my sins…  \n  \n…then, surely things will get back to normal. Then, I will get what I’ve always wanted…a new job, more financial security, a husband, a full life with no pain and according to my will and plan.  \n  \nMy desire to change the inside has passed the Lord all together. He has become a means of getting what I want, and to where I believe I will find true happiness. God has become the padlock that is holding my blessings, and I am desperate to figure out the combination.  \n  \nI recognize my need to stop seeing a padlock, but see God. Stop thinking He is holding things from me, but that He is enough for me…more than enough…all I need… Not only is there nothing I can do to make Him love me more or less, but the Lord wants what we all want: To be loved for who He is, not for what He can give.  \n  \nHow do you see God? As a reluctant giver? Or as the loving, perfect Father who runs to His children? Maybe somewhere in between?

These were the days when cancer stricken clouds of smoke were magically halted from coming over the half-wall at your favorite restaurant, protecting you from the plume of doom? Well, it’s a great example of our utter impatience. Even at the expense of our impending demise, we are impatient! We have microwaves that can cook turkeys now!! We have cars that can go 0-60 in less than 4 seconds. We want what we want RIGHT NOW! The detriment of this impatience comes when we do not learn from our very own past mistakes, or even the mistakes of others that derived from our hearts natural (fleshly) desire to take control!<!--more-->  \n  \n“A wise man learns from his mistakes, a wiser man learns from someone else’s mistakes” – Unknown  \n  \nKnowing that God is in control of the details of our lives is a comforting realization that everything will be alright. Therefore, patience should be a byproduct of such knowledge. Sometimes we want to move ahead of God’s provision in our life when we are called to wait. What does waiting mean? Do we sit under the tree on the bench at the park and wait? Or are we called to obedience in our waiting? We should be überly encouraged by the work that can be in progress while we wait! Abundant life is available through Jesus Christ, our ALL sufficient King, who has our best interest at His center. Although we fail, epically at times, to position him at our center, He will never leave us nor forsake us!  \n  \n\"Keep your lives free from the love of money and BE CONTENT with what you have, because God has said, 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.' So we say with confidence, 'The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?'\" ~Hebrews 13:5-6 (NIV)  \n  \nLearning how to love, give, and serve obediently while waiting for that next promotion, that next job, that special someone, or that answer from God on your life’s next steps is precious! The blessings from this waiting are some of your prized moments in your life that you will NOT want to live without once you obtain the resilience to face the waiting while focusing, not on the object of your waiting, but on God and your neighbor!  \n  \n\"Jesus replied: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' ALL the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\" ~Matthew 22:37-40 (NIV)  \n  \nWhenever I am not working on a Saturday morning, I spend time with “the least of these” (Matthew 25:40) in South Dallas with Solomon’s Porch. This is small example of actively waiting. Rick Warren reminds us in the first few words of “The Purpose Driven Life” --- It’s NOT about you! South Dallas has men and women that have forgotten about the God they once loved. They sometimes meet God for the first time through a salvation experience, or maybe receive a reminder through encouraging words of love from those that are able to volunteer their time. After all, I think LOVE is spelled T-I-M-E. Where do you spend your time?  \n  \nPersonally, I cannot articulate in words the abundant life that comes from following Christ in obedience. Sometimes it is tears of joy, or it can be a peace that passes all understanding (Philippians 4:6-7). JP hears Watermark missionaries account for “never feeling so alive” when returning from pursuing the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20). It’s a blessing guys and gals to Love, Give, and Serve WHILE WAITING! I can promise you that I have not had an ounce of regret when I have chosen to follow Christ instead of myself. God is constantly blessing His children, and I know God desires to bless you beyond your imagination! He knows you, He made you, and He has your best interests at heart.

JP has done just what last week's message was about...He has pointed each of us to truth in love.<!--more-->  \n  \nHere is a TOP 10 List of things JP has taught us this year:  \n  \n10. I’ve learned that being single is a time to fully leverage myself for the Lord and grow in Him, preparing myself for however God chooses to use me during the rest of my life. (James 5:8) -Kyle Bourne-  \n  \n9. I’ve learned what it means to walk in the light (1 John 1:7), grateful for your friendship and your countless sit downs full of encouragement. (Hebrews 10:24-25) -Jarid Ghaffari-  \n  \n8. I’ve learned \"It's not about YOU! It's about GOD.\" (JP) This life is not about me and my desires. It is about living only to glorify GOD. So, those whose are lost can see my eternal joy from the works Christ Jesus is doing in my life. (Galatians 2:20) –Nick Chilton-  \n  \n7. I’ve learned not to pray that God will remove all the trials in my life. Rather to be joyful in spirit, as such trials can bring a new closeness with and understanding of Christ’s character when I persevere well in Him. (James 1:12) -Nathan Harness-  \n  \n6. I’ve learned what patiently bearing with one another looks like, as JP has borne with me in my weakness (Ephesians 4:2-3). –Chris Gurley-  \n  \n5. I've learned to trust and obey the Lord. To not rely on my own judgment, but to pray and trust in my Savior for everything. (Proverbs 3:5-7) –Jennifer Bryant-  \n  \n4. I’ve learned that my 20's aren't just life's waiting room between my teenage years and marriage but rather a time to throw myself whole-heartedly into the service of God while there are no distractions. (1 Corinthians 7:25-35) –DeAndrea Harris-  \n  \n3. I've learned to be set apart in faith AND action and to be able to give an account for my lack of conformity to this world the way Dallas sees it. Giving an answer to the hope that I've found in Christ Jesus (James 2:18; Romans 12:1-2; 1 Peter 3:15). -Chris Landry-  \n  \n2. I’ve learned to trust and believe in the Gospel. My life is no longer my own, and should look completely different because of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. (Mark 8:34-36) –Allyson Black-  \n  \n1. We’ve learned that although JP is a great friend and leader who loves all of us of, he is just a shadow of the greatest love of all.  \n  \n\"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\" (Romans 5:8)  \n  \n\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\" (John 3:16)  \n  \nThank you, JP, for pointing us to the greatest love of all...Jesus Christ.

I truly enjoyed learning about Islam and the differences in Muslim and Christian beliefs. I left filled with joy that we serve a loving and just God. It was great to be reminded that our faith has historical facts to validate what we believe. And that our salvation is not based on a weighted scale, but based on grace through faith.<!--more-->  \n  \n“Our good works are a proof of our salvation, not to earn it.” (Ephesians 2:8-9)  \n  \n“If righteousness could be earned through works, Jesus died in vain.” (Galatians 2:21)  \n  \n“You stand on what you have done, or what Christ has done.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, Romans 5:8)  \n  \nJust earlier this morning I was on a plane back to Dallas and pulled out my notes journal to write today’s Porch News. The man sitting next to me asked if I was a student, and I replied, “No sir, I am working on a devotional for my church group. We actually had this incredible speaker come and share with us about Islam last Tuesday...” I got so excited about the opportunity God was providing. After a few minutes of chatting he finally said, “Yeah I sort of believe that all religions could be correct and lead to the same god.” OH BOY!!! PERFECT lay-up for conversation. I opened my notes from the past two weeks and went through them sharing about Islam, Universalism, Pluralism, Inclusivism, Exclusivism, and we continued chatting. It was awesome! God is so good! He is LORD. He is the great I AM! His Word is truth. O praise Him!  \n  \n\"Jesus answered, 'I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me, but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.'\" (John 10:25-30)  \n  \nThe truth is when I got on the plane I couldn’t wait to talk about all the football games this weekend, but the man next to me wasn’t interested in football. Praise God I didn’t waste time trying to talk to him about stuff that really doesn’t matter, when that time was obviously meant to be used for the glory of God. O praise Him!  \n  \n“Love by its very nature must be freely given. If you love someone for what they give you, you don’t love them, you love what they do.”"},"url":{"en-US":"the-greatest-motivator-in-life-is-love"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-greatest-motivator-in-life-is-love/"}}},

Do we have a relationship that when He comes back…Christ will invite us to come with Him? (Isaiah 66:2, Matthew 5:6-7, Luke 14:27)  \n  \nDo we have a LOVE that SEEKS out the needy, SERVES them not by what they deserve but by what they need, and SENDS others towards Christ- compelling them to want to know our God? (James 1:27, Hebrews 13:2, Matthew 25)  \n  \nIt is sad to me that the same excuses Jesus talks about in Luke 14, that they used to not come to his banqueting table, are the same we use today. We have misplaced priorities because of our possessions, professions, and people in our lives. So often we let the good things in our life distract us from the ultimate. I pray that we stop filling our lives with stuff, and start filling our lives with Christ.<!--more-->  \n  \nI felt convicted about how selfish I often can be, and how I have had the attitude of what is going to happen to me if I stop and help someone? Maybe I’ll be late to where I am going. Compared to the attitude of the Samaritan, what will happen to them if I do not stop to help? It truly concerns me that selflessness is so uncommon that it seems crazy. I pray that we would live selflessly, generously, and show mercy to others.  \n  \nWhy do we look at others and ourselves in terms of what we deserve? We deserve nothing, yet have been given everything. We have been given grace, upon grace, upon grace...why do we not love others this way? Like JP said, there are a lot of people doing good in this world (see Oprah), but if it is not done in the name of the Gospel we are just building this world…instead of the eternal kingdom. (Titus 3:4-7) I pray that we would never forget what Christ has done for us, and that we would continue sharing the Good News with all those we meet. I pray that our good deeds would be out of love for Christ and always point back to Him.  \n  \nI know these are a lot of thoughts, but we seem to often forget the greatest commandments: love God and love others. (Matthew 22:37-39)  \n  \n\"Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble.\" (1 Peter 3:8)"},"url":{"en-US":"love-that-does"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/love-that-does/"}}},

Van Beckwith, a leader of the Watermark Justice team and the Watermark Operations team, didn’t imagine he would be packing his things and traveling to one of the most dangerous places in the world to buy a group of African lawyers dinner. But in the fall of 2006, he was boarding a plane with a group of Watermark elders with plans to do just that.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nIn the months before the trip, Van had spoken with a friend about issues of justice and Christianity, and was pointed to a book by Gary Haugen, founder of the [International Justice Mission](http://www.ijm.org/), entitled _[The Good News About Injustice](https://secure3.convio.net/ijm/site/Ecommerce/1528637136?VIEW_PRODUCT=true&product_id=1241&store_id=1101)_. IJM’s focus is on working with local governments to seek justice for those who have fallen victim to slavery, sexual exploitation and other forms of violent oppression.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n“I started reading about how God is a God of justice, and I immediately began seeing the parallels between that principle and being a lawyer,” he said. “Gary talks about the fact that God doesn’t have another plan other than us being here on this earth. There is no Plan B. We have to be the hands and feet of justice.”  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nWhen invited to accompany a group of elders going to Goma, Congo, on an exploratory trip, Van did not accept immediately. The team’s purpose was to see the needs in Goma and to pray about how and if Watermark should be working with the leadership of the country. He didn’t know much about the region, so he did some research.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n“It seemed like a very far off, mysterious kind of place,” he said. “I went to the U.N. and State Department websites and found out that Goma was not really a place you should be going. At the time, the largest U.N. peacekeeping force was there. 17,000 of what they call ‘blue helmets.’”  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nAfter his research, and despite the danger involved, Van accepted the invitation to travel to Goma – on one condition. He wanted to meet with judges and lawyers there to talk about what they could do to improve the justice system in their country.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n“It seemed like a very lawless place,” he said. “And it seemed very logical that if there were Christian lawyers and judges – or even nonbelievers – that would stand up and be about justice, it would make a huge impact. It would perhaps make a bigger impact than anything else.”  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nWith the help of ALARM (African Leadership and Reconciliation Ministry), a group of local lawyers and judges gathered for dinner. Van’s hope was to encourage them to take a stand to right the injustices occurring in their country, and to let them know they were not alone.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nHe didn’t know what to expect when he walked into a room of about 40 young Africans looking at him with eyes full of discomfort and skepticism.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n“They had their arms crossed and were just looking at me like, ‘What’s he trying to sell?’ or ‘What’s he trying to take?’” he said. “I told them flat out, ‘I don’t have a book. I don’t have a video. I don’t have anything to sell you. I just wanted to buy you dinner.’ And you could see they all started to relax.”  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nVan and others presented the Gospel to this group of justice professionals. They talked about how God loves justice and how Christians are called to care for orphans and widows.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n“In the course of a few hours, we saw these people come alive and realize that they could make a difference in this lawless land,” he said. “These are people who are laying their lives on the line if they’re going to do what we’re asking them to do.”  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nThis was the first time these judges and lawyers had been brought together to talk through some of the issues they faced every day. It was a breakthrough that was needed to spark a conversation about what it means to be a lawyer and a Christian.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nWhen Van arrived back in the states, he approached several other lawyers in the Watermark community, including Rick Howard and Jeff Ward. He spoke with them about his experience and encouraged them to start thinking about going to Africa to build on the progress that was made.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n“We needed to get another group of lawyers over there and see if we could build something that will out-sustain us,” he said. “We want Africans to run Africa.”  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nIn the fall of 2007, another group of lawyers traveled to Goma to shepherd the men and women struggling with their faith in a broken system. Jeff Ward, Watermark’s director of external focus, was stirred by Van’s experience and traveled to Goma on a second trip. Jeff practiced law in Dallas for about 14 years before joining the Watermark staff. He was just as passionate about encouraging young African lawyers to be about God’s calling for justice.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n|  \n [![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_E1Hkx51GLaU/TPKEWuaL6GI/AAAAAAAAAFY/z6T2EH3h2tM/s320/zreaport.gif)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_E1Hkx51GLaU/TPKEWuaL6GI/AAAAAAAAAFY/z6T2EH3h2tM/s1600/zreaport.gif) |\n  \n|  \n (Photo from [here](http://maps.thefullwiki.org/Congo_Railway)) |\n  \n  \n\n  \n\nJeff met with members of the International Justice Mission’s field office in Kingali, Rwanda, and spent some time with a group of Christian lawyers.\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n“We talked through some of the things that they struggle with on a daily basis, like bribery,” he said. “They struggle with what it means to be a Christian and a lawyer when your clients expect you to bribe the judges and the judges expect to be bribed. If you’re not part of that practice, you’re practicing law behind the eight ball.”  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nIn response to their questions, Jeff said they told them what they knew was truth.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n“We were diving into scripture and what God has to say about justice issues and how we want to be passionate about what God is passionate about,” he said. “We know from Micah 6:8 that there’s a short list of what God wants us to be passionate about, and at the top of that list is to promote justice. That’s something we can do as Christian lawyers, whether we’re in Africa or Dallas.”  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nAfter seeing for himself the need for dialog and instruction, Jeff came back to the states and began planning the next trip to Goma. In March 2008, six Dallas lawyers went back to Goma to continue their work with the judges and lawyers in the trenches of a war on the people of Congo.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n“The people of Goma inherited a lot of turmoil from the Rwandan genocide,” Jeff said. “They got the refugees and the rebels who perpetrated that genocide, but they don’t have the leadership to resolve the conflict.”  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nThe group assisted with leadership development training and conflict resolution training in an effort to equip African lawyers and judges to maintain and uphold justice in their courtrooms and in their country.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \nWhile important work is being done in Goma, Van and Jeff agree that it is Africans that should be leading Africa.  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n“To me, part of what I want I want to be remembered for is building into men and women who, over there, can be leaders,” Van said. “The reality is that Dallas lawyers – lawyers with Watermark Justice – are too far away to affect daily change over there. But we can build into people’s lives and tell them that their lives matter and that we love them and that we’re going to equip them. And then we have to leave it up to God to do whatever God is going to do.”  \n  \nJeff said he sees in these men and women a group who will do what is necessary to right the wrongs in their country.  \n  \n\"It really is a group of highly-passionate, motivated, strong-believing guys and gals over there with a heart to transform their country for Christ,\" he said.  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n|  \n [![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E1Hkx51GLaU/TPKDOkYHpCI/AAAAAAAAAFU/7hXt0SGPXsU/s320/83532861.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_E1Hkx51GLaU/TPKDOkYHpCI/AAAAAAAAAFU/7hXt0SGPXsU/s1600/83532861.jpg) |\n  \n|  \n   \n\n(Photo from [here)](http://www.life.com/image/83532861)\n |\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"justice-for-the-congo"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/justice-for-the-congo/"}}},

I am constantly in a state of expectation of how the Lord might direct and move me day to day, and even moment by moment. Some days that expectation is filled with enthusiasm and eagerness, ready for some fresh breath into my old ragged life. Other days that expectation is filled with exhaustion and avoidance, dreading the prospect of things dear to me being torn away from me.  \n  \n**I expect the Lord to change things in a moment.** I expect it because I’ve seen it… both good and bad. I’ve seen it. I believe in it, and ultimately I rather enjoy it. I enjoy having that front row seat to the story of my life, watching at times the futile twists and turns make sense. I like seeing the loose ends tie together when I least expect it.<!--more-->  \n  \nBut, I usually don’t see any of this until after it has happened and long passed. For example, my mission trip to Brazil. I knew it was going to be impactful. I went in anticipation for it to change my world. I came home unsure what I was looking for, and a far cry from the world changing experience I had invisioned. I thought I'd come back visibly changed. I'm not sure how, but I wanted that dramatic moment.... it just never came. Now 1.5 years later I’m starting to be able to look back and see some of the monumental ways the Lord used that time to shift my life and even more my heart. Then, I couldn’t see it.  \n  \nThat isn’t how a movie gets to works. In a movie the character often gets the chance to recognize the moment. The moment where their lives are changed. They are changed. And even in those movies where the character might not know, the audience definitely gets a piece of the action. They see the moment. They marvel in it. They swim in the experience. They know that little twist of life, a letter mailed, a door opened, a coffee spilled, will change everything for the character. **They know the moment and the moment knows them.**  \n  \nIt is in the after-moments I take to look back on opportunities, pains and adventures, and I remember them with a fondness I never experiences in the “thens.” Why can’t life be like that movie moment? Why can’t I be and know in the moment all it is doing in shaping me right then?  \n  \n**I want to know the moment. I want to own the moment. But, I don’t think God works like that. I don’t think God works like the movies.**  \n  \nI’m not talking about the moments where life physically changes. People die. Marriages happen. Children are born. Houses are sold. Life moves on. Those moments are visible to all from the external.  \n  \nI’m talking about those internal soul moments. It could be a simple hello to a homeless person. A walk in the neighborhood. A new hobby experienced. A trip planned. It is those moments that too often we have no way of knowing the lasting impact they could have on us. It is those moments that I try so hard to understand, and yet I don’t think they can be understood until after. It is those moments that taunt me in the movies, and slip through my grasp. It is those moments that truly change us inside out. Those are the moments I want to “be” in and know. Those are the moments that only time can tell, after they have passed.  \n  \n**What moments in life can you look back on now and know it changed you?** "},"url":{"en-US":"when-things-change-my-life"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/when-things-change-my-life/"}}},

I loved when David talked about how we constantly look to the next best thing for temporary pleasure and happiness. Then \"even when you get the exact thing you want, the excitement of it only last so long\". For young adults this often comes in the form of a relationship. While searching for the one thing that will satisfy we often end up \"demanding more from that person, than they can give.\"<!--more-->  \n  \nAfter taking time away from dating I’ve finally felt my heart open to date again. I’ve also found the devil sneaking his way back into my life in the form of insecurity.  \n  \nThe Bible tells us in 1 Peter 5:8, \"Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.\"  \n  \nWhen relationships don’t work out I’ve started to question my worth, and how people view me. If only I was quieter, looked different, or haven’t gone through a divorce etc maybe things would work out differently. My dear friend Lulie would say, \"That is a lie from the pit of hell.\"  \n  \nMy worth and yours is found only in Christ Jesus. Like David said, the thing I need most is not a relationship, not more money, not a new car…It is a greater understanding, an intimate relationship, with my heavenly Father. I see clearly that I need more time with the Lord to continue working through these insecurities, and that no relationship, attention, or compliments from a man will ever satisfy. I could never put that expectation on a guy (career, money, etc) to satisfy only what can be found in the Lord. Those things will only have and will leave me feeling that there has to be something more. Understanding who God is and growing my relationship with Him is the only thing that matters. I loved when Todd referenced Matt Chandler this Sunday when he said, \"All that matters is...I am His.\"  \n  \nThen Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.\" (John 6:35)  \n  \nWhat are you looking towards to find satisfaction? Where are you finding your worth?  \n  \nI encourage you all to read through Isaiah 55 & Psalm 23. ~Praying for you all..."},"url":{"en-US":"where-are-you-finding-your-worth"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/where-are-you-finding-your-worth/"}}},

What breaks my heart is that we, ourselves, are what is going to keep us from eternity in heaven with our Father. \"What prevents us from all the goodness God has for us? Ourselves.\" (Matthew 10:39, John 3:30) Who should end up in hell? Everyone. We have all run from God. (Mark 10:18)  \n  \n\"What shall we conclude then? Are we any better? Not at all!...

We often respond, \"Nah, love me.\"\n  \n- The opposite of loving God is not worshiping Satan, it is worshipping self.\n  \n- We love His stuff and so often just want to bargain with him to get what we want.\n  \n  \nI pray so much that you all would experience what I have in the moment where I \"got it\"...I need JESUS, I need a SAVIOR!

I can't begin to tell you how excited I am to be here and watch my Auburn Tigers! Auburn is known for a lot of things, but one thing I've loved this year is our slogan \"AU Family All In\". I was thinking about this slogan on the flight here and wondered: what if we were all truly sold out for Christ leveraging everything for Him and His Kingdom?<!--more-->  \n  \nFor big events that we are excited about we wait with such anticipation and prepare in so many ways. Taking off work, purchasing tickets, and packing orange and blue in this case. More importantly, what are we doing to prepare for Christ's return? Are we preparing with an even greater excitement and anticipation? It will be an even greater day than anything we can possibly imagine for those who have believed in their heart and confessed with their mouth that Jesus is Lord. (Romans 10)  \n  \nHonestly, if we truly took a good look at our lives we'd probably see a common theme of selfishness and focus on the things of this world. How quickly we forget we are heirs to the Kingdom!  \n  \n\"At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.\" (Titus 3:3-8)  \n  \nGod's family, are you ALL IN? Are you leveraging everything for Him? Are you sharing the joy and hope you've found in the Lord with all those you meet? I was so encouraged last night when one of my friends took the opportunity to change the conversation away from football and all the glits and glam at this Auburn event and decided to talk about the Lord with one of my friends who now plays in the NFL. He could of asked for an autograph or picture, but instead he ceased that moment and leveraged it for the Kingdom.

It hits me when I least expect it. Emptiness. Darkness. I don’t know where it comes from. I don’t know how it got here. Numbness. Despair. Hurt and fear. When I stop and listen, it’s there. It come in waves, or drips in like a faucet. It makes its home unwelcomed. It stays well past its expiration date.  \n  \nIt’s here, and I don’t know how to get it to leave. I know temporary cures. Business. Activities. Laughter. Movies. Books. Pursuits. Passion. Plans. Dreams. Achievements...<!--more-->  \n  \nBut they are just that, temporary. The minute things don’t meet my expectations, my needs, they fall through the hole I have been trying to patch. That hole that grows larger yet shrinks at other times. That hole that stubbornness and pride refuses to let close. That hole that makes me want to throw something at someone when they say only Jesus can fill it...even if it is true.  \n  \nJesus might be the only thing that can fill it, but I’m dealing with my flesh. That carnal part of my body that fights and runs from holiness. That part of me which, for a short time, can walk the walk and talk the talk, but then reality comes in and tears me apart. To know I need to live by his strength, and yet find myself in this never-ending battle of self-dependency.  \n  \nI want the hole to fill. I want sustenance to come from Him, but what happens if, on this earth, that will never be? Then what? We weren’t made for this earth, so do you still strive for it? Do you still fight to win an uphill battle? Or do you give up? Resign yourself to failure? Pursue the temporal things of this world?  \n  \nAs much as I try to run after those other things (relationships, career success, power, wealth, the night life, beauty, perfectionism, possessions, etc) the reality is, the knowledge that it can't sustain haunts me. At these times naivete seems bliss. I could spend my whole life pursuing one thing after another to find wholeness and fulfillment, not having the foreknowledge that it wouldn’t. Temporarily it would. Permanently it couldn’t.  \n  \nAt times that sounds better than having one option staring me back.

Finding the soft spongy completeness to fill my hole?  \n  \nI know in my head that isn’t true, but too often in my heart it feels that way. Life apart from the Lord is darkness. Life with the Lord is hard. My options are darkness or difficulties and trials. At least the difficulties and trials though are in the light, and temporary.  \n  \nOh, how we are not made for this world! Oh, how this reminds me of my daily need for God! Oh, how my hole so desperately wants to find comfort elsewhere! But it is in the elsewhere that the hole only gets bigger and bigger. Not better, just bigger. Bigger as I continue to recognize my larger and larger need for Christ.  \n  \nMy hole. A daily reminder that this life is not meant for fulfillment and completeness. In fact this life is to remind us daily of our need. Our need for a Savior. Jesus.  \n  \nWith what are you trying to fill your heart?

He is Jehovah, the self-existent, covenant-keeping God.\" (Lord I Want to Know You, 55)  \n  \nWhen I reflect on this past year at The Porch it’s been amazing to see God’s faithfulness in so many of our lives. We are not the same as we were a year ago, and I pray we continue to grow in the likeness of Christ Jesus. I pray that our eyes would be fixed on Jesus (2 Corinthians 4:18, Hebrews 12:2), that we would trust in our LORD who never leaves us nor forsakes us (Deuteronomy 31), who does not change (James 1:17), and always provides. I pray that you would know the Lord as your Jehovah-jireh, \"the Lord will provide.\"  \n  \nThank you for letting me serve with you all this past year. It has truly brought me so much joy. As I think of 2011 I pray that our New Year’s resolutions wouldn’t be something that a month from now we forget or doesn’t really matter, but that we would commit to seek Christ, know Him, trust Him, and be more like Him. Forgiving others, glorifying Him in all we do, and living on mission for His eternal Kingdom. I pray we would hold loosely to the things of this world, and cling tightly to the cross.  \n  \nAs always...Praying for you all~  \n  \nHAPPY NEW YEAR!"},"url":{"en-US":"god-remains-the-same"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/god-remains-the-same/"}}},

Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!\" (2 Corinthians 5:13-17)  \n  \nHAPPY NEW YEAR!

Clearly, I was a conflicted kid. Certainly these aspirations changed as I grew older and my passions shifted from a “home on the range” to art, communication, and ultimately theology. This leaves me to wonder, when did I grow up? When did this actually take place. I understand it was a process, but it seems that I should be able to point to some graduation or birthday and say, “Yup, there it is. That’s when it happened. That’s when I grew up.”  \n  \nI’m reminded of a recent meeting where a young adult told me he felt he was getting old but he didn’t want to let go of his crazy, youthful life. I was thinking, “Bro, you’re 30. It is indeed time to graduate from adolescence.” I think, too often, our twenties and thirties are spent continuing to dream about what we will do when we grow up. Here we are. All grown up. Men and women fully capable of being used by God and leveraged for His Kingdom. Why does it seem that sometimes our agenda gets in the way of that ultimate agenda?<!--more-->  \n  \nThis marks a new season of The Porch. I cannot look backwards without being overwhelmed with gratitude. The Porch leaders and volunteers have done an amazing job of hosting, shepherding, communicating to, and connecting Dallas Young Adults. Thank you. God has been so faithful to continue to reveal Himself to those in our midst and it seems every single Tuesday some have entrusted their lives to Him. We have been able to talk about real-life issues of Dallas singles and young adults, and we have looked at how the scriptures address these topics. We have been able to worship God uninhibitedly, with our whole selves, offering our lives to Him.  \n  \nThis next season we will focus on living life on purpose. We will, with your help, raise awareness that there are no accidents in the Kingdom. God is in control and He desires to accomplish things through us; Ephesians 2:10. Among Christians, there are no random acts of kindness, just intentional acts of obedience and faith. As we start this series, you have an incredible opportunity to invite that co-worker, neighbor, or old friend to join you for The Porch and free concert January 18th, 7PM. We have 2200 seats for American Idol’s Jason Castro. I look forward to being with you then, and talking through what this next season has in store. Please pray with me over that evening and the Tuesdays to come. Our team is excited to serve you and your friends and lead you into full service to an AMAZING God. Let’s grow up on purpose, together.  \n  \nSincerely,  \nJP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"growing-up-on-purpose"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/growing-up-on-purpose/"}}},

While listening to Todd's message yesterday about John 3:16, I was drawn to him explaining what scripture means when it says \"God so loved…”. I encourage you all to go back and listen to the message if you weren't able to attend.  \n  \n\"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\" (John 3:16)  \n  \nThere seemed to be a theme lately of what love is. My parents and friends are a great reminder and example of love being selfless and unconditional, but even their love is nothing compared to the love of Christ.  \n  \nI've struggled at times during my life of feeling unlovable by others and completely unworthy of Christ's love. The problem with this is there is nothing we can do to earn or separate us from God's love. God is love.<!--more-->  \n  \n\"This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins… God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him.\" (1 John 4:9-10,16)  \n  \n\"For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" (Romans 8:38-39)  \n  \nI want to take this opportunity to invite you and any of your friends to come and see at The Porch tomorrow night. Before I understood the Gospel and God's love, I didn't understand how God could possibly love me because I've often ran from him and did what I wanted to. I really relate to LeCrae's song _Take Me As I Am_, the beginning of the song says…\n\n> I talked to a cat the other day and he was like, \"Man, I really want to come to Christ, but I have to clean my life up first. Get my sins together...\" I told him I used to think that way too. I thought I had to change myself before I could come to Christ, but CHRIST CHANGED ME.  \nI can totally relate to this, and maybe you can too. Maybe you are living in sin and don't understand why God would love you and send his only Son to die for YOU. Or maybe you are clinging onto things of this world that seem too great to let go of and surrender to Christ. No matter where you are and what you are going through, God meets you where you are. He loves you, and sometimes that means he loves you enough to change you. I am so stoked about this series we are starting tomorrow and can't wait to see how the Lord continues to sharpen us! COME AS YOU ARE...COME AND SEE!  \n  \nPraying for you all~"},"url":{"en-US":"come-as-you-are-come-see"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/come-as-you-are-come-see/"}}},

Where were most of your thoughts this weekend? Worrying about work, relationships, money....thinking about sex, drugs, when the next party is....where have your thoughts been?  \n  \nJP really challenged me last week with living under the influence of Christ. I loved when he said, \"TAKE YOUR THOUGHTS CAPTIVE. Doing this prevents the sin, which prevents death.\"<!--more-->  \n  \n\"We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.\" (2 Corinthians 10:5)  \n  \nTo be honest, my thoughts are all over the place much of the time. Thinking of where I need to be, what I need to be doing, am I doing good enough? Thoughts of wanting a relationship, a cute pair of jeans I saw, when can I go on vacation?  \n  \nThe problem with most of my thoughts is they have nothing to do with the Lord or trusting in him. My thoughts have all to do with my desires. \"Driving under the influence of self.\" The last month or so I’ve really been working on taking my thoughts captive. This literally means turning my thoughts to truth right in that moment and away from doubt, selfish desires, worry etc. For example, the second I start wishing I had a relationship like I see many of my friends finding, I turn my thoughts to Jeremiah 29:11, \"For I know the plans I have for you,\" declares the LORD, \"plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\"  \n  \nI turn to TRUTH, and find PEACE.  \n  \n\"Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace.\" (Romans 8:5-6)  \n  \nSince taking my thoughts captive, I can attest to the fact it truly does keep you from sinning. Take one thought captive at a time and watch God work in your life. It is awesome. \"When we stop driving under the influence of self, and start driving under the influence of Christ...we stand in HIS GRACE, not under his wrath.\"  \n  \n\"No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God.\" (1 John 3:9)  \n  \n\"We are set free, justified, and made righteous under the influence of Christ.\"  \n  \nWhere are your thoughts at?

To be honest the last couple years I've hated this day. I used to wonder what was so wrong with me? Why didn't I have a date, boyfriend, or a guy to send me flowers and chocolate (besides my dad)?  \n  \nThe truth is Valentine's Day isn't the only day that I've worried, was anxious, and feared being single. JP spoke last Tuesday on fear (anxiety/worry) and I loved when he said:  \n  \n\"Our idols make us anxious. Those things we've put our hope in.\"  \n  \nFor some of you the idol may be job or financial status, but for me there was much of my life my hope was in having a boyfriend/husband. My hope, my belief, was that if I just had a relationship life would be complete and everything would be ok.  \n  \nWhile talking about that fear, JP said, \"It distracts us so much to where we can't focus. We stress that we don't know what the answer is and ultimately it robs us of productivity.\"<!--more-->  \n  \nIt makes me cringe to think about the amount of time I've wasted worrying about if a guy was going to call, if he liked me, if he was going to ask me out. It's so true that fear can completely consume us, make us think illogically, and completely rob us of productivity. It allows the devil this huge foothold in our lives. We lose focus that GOD IS GOOD. SOVEREIGN. FAITHFUL. HE IS LOVE and so much more!  \n  \n\"For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, 'Abba, Father.'\" (Romans 8:15)  \n  \nI love how far the Lord has brought me. I honestly could care less if I get flowers or have a date today. What I care about today is am I loving, serving, and obeying God? Or am I chasing mirages that look good and pleasing only to find out they will never satisfy what can only be satisfied by my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?  \n  \nI love that God hasn't changed my circumstance of being single, but that he's changed me. This past year of being single I've gotten do more things than ever, and experience Christ in an even greater more intimate way than I ever imagined. This time hasn't been wasted. It has been incredibly fun and productive!  \n  \n\"Faith is not asking God for what you want and expecting Him to give it to you. Faith is trusting what you have is what God knows you need.\"  \n  \nWhether we are in a relationship or not we are children of God. We are loved...  \n  \n\"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\" (Romans 5:8)  \n  \nTHAT IS LOVE.  \n  \nPraying for you all~ Praying not that you would have a valentine, but that you would already know how greatly loved you are!"},"url":{"en-US":"its-valentines-day"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/its-valentines-day/"}}},

My actions glorified how \"strong\" I was and had nothing to do with how great God is. There was a year of my life where I was under the influence of alcohol quite a bit. I used to like to say it gave me \"liquid courage\" to do and say things that I wanted to. The truth is, I used alcohol to numb how I was really feeling…lonely, broken, scared, hopeless, unlovable, and unforgiveable.  \n  \nTodd touched on it Sunday when he said, \"closed doors will never stop or hide the destruction going on in your life.\" I thank God so much for bringing me to my knees, and to a place of true authenticity where I didn’t have to hide my struggles behind closed doors. I could finally lay down everything at the foot of the cross. Because of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus I found healing, forgiveness, peace, and love.  \n  \nIt wasn't until I truly grasped the Gospel that I could understand Romans 7:15-25. I encourage you to spend some time with the Lord going through this passage. I’ve put some of the verse below:  \n  \n\"For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing... What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!\"  \n  \nIt’s so easy to live in a way that our actions glorify ourselves. The whole \"look at me\" mentality, saying we don't care what others think of us, yet living in a way to get others attention and approval. I pray that our actions and words would glorify our SAVIOR instead of ourselves. That we would love and point to our CREATOR rather than his creations.  \n  \nI was reminded recently that I shouldn’t fit in the scene I used to be a part of. Not because I am in any way judging, but because I am alive in Christ and live in the light. As believers we should stand out by our actions. People should want to know what/who we are being influenced by...Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior.  \n  \nAre you under the influence of self and this world, or under the influence of Christ? Are your actions pointing back to and glorifying God?  \n  \nI loved after winning the Super Bowl Greg Jennings first response was, \"Wow...To God be the glory.\""},"url":{"en-US":"what-does-your-life-say"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-does-your-life-say/"}}},

I partied, dated, and spent more money than I had. Living it up, as the world would say. I thought I was in control, but to be honest my life was spinning out of control. I was exhausted from trying to control my life and hit rock bottom...completely broken. I realized I was never in control, needed to stop trying to control, and trust God who is always in control. (See Jeremiah 17:5-8)  \n  \n\"There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.\" (Proverbs 14:12)  \n  \nWhen I finally could see past myself and realize this life isn’t about me, I FOUND LIFE.

God’s got me!  \n  \nI may not be dating anyone or married, I may not have my ideal job, but I have life in Christ!

If I am in danger here, it cannot be any greater than what I just came from.” Although I think it goes without saying, I am going to say it anyway…. that I am not suggesting that you cannot live for Jesus if you live in a nice neighborhood or a nice house- whatever the measure of that is. I am only saying that this world is full of many kinds of danger and brokenness, some of which we find threatening and some of which we are alarmingly comfortable with. Moving here has been part of God waking us up to both dangers with which we have become comfortable and commands of the gospel to which we have become numb. So I am grateful. Grateful that God is teaching me more and more how to let go of my plans and my ideas and my assumptions and letting me experience, instead, the joy of simply following Him. There has been more of that needed than I would have liked to believe about myself. And the more I hold onto Christ the greater my awareness that there is more of the world to let go of… and it is life-giving.  \nIf you are holding on to that which doesn’t matter, you are not holding on to that which does.

You'll have something to apply here (I do!).  \n  \nAs a brief reminder, the goal of this little series is to stir up the men who follow Christ at The Porch and elsewhere to recognize that we are indeed men (no longer boys) and to live accordingly. So, without further adieu, let's get back on the trail and see where the Word leads...<!--more-->  \n> \"Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.\" ~1 Timothy 5:1-2 NIV  \nIn this letter, Paul (older guy) is writing to Timothy (younger guy) about how to interact with people in the church he is leading. Picture Timothy as a guy around 30 years old (give or take a few years), so probably like a lot of us. ![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//794801_young_man_series_5.jpg \"Young man\")In his daily life, he interacts with older guys, younger guys, older women, and younger women, and Paul gives him some pointers on how to honor Christ in those relationships. For this part, we'll hone in on the \"younger women\" (your female peers) part.  \n  \nWhat are the two key words associated with \"younger women\"? That's right: \"sisters\", and \"purity\". And not just any flavor of \"purity\", but \"_absolute_ purity\" (Paul doesn't leave us much gray area here, does he?). So what are some of the thoughts that come to mind when you think about your sister(s), or even what the world tells us about how a big brother and his (little) sister? My favorite is the image of me beating up some punk who even thinks about disrespecting my sister (that hasn't happened yet, but I secretly hope it does, so I can swoop in, kick his butt, and rescue my sister). Isn't that what brothers are supposed to do?  \n  \n ![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//1089612_knight_statue.jpg \"Knight\")If that's the case, are we treating the women we're around (and interested in) like that punk I want to pound, or like the knight I hope to be (protecting and saving her)? It seems like at least a few in our midst (is it us?) are being punks. Now maybe you're not insulting girls or openly trying to seduce them, but are you pushing the limit on how far you can go physically in relationships? Maybe you think you love the girl. Maybe you've even talked marriage. Until you stand in front of a lot of people, swap metal bands, and say \"I do.\", it really doesn't matter what you think or say. She's your sister, and \"absolute purity\" is asking for a beating from any of her brothers who stand for her honor and Christ's. I know. It's a hard stand to take, but it's time to man up.  \n  \nWe have a few more steps to take before we break for part 3, and this piece hits me. When I was in college, it was just easier to develop friendships with the girls than the guys. Invest an hour in conversation, and all of a sudden, you have a new set of friends (girls). With guys, though, it took more time, sometimes just doing nothing, watching TV, or gaming. Eventually, the bonds forged ![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//brazil_men.jpg \"brazil\\_men\") and brothers were made. How do you grow to become a more godly _man_? Hang around other _men_ pursuing Christ. If I look at your life and you look at mine, will we find more time spent with guy friends or girl friends? It might feel good (and be neutral/fine) to spend more time with the ladies (even those with no romantic potential), but I'd throw us all a challenge to seek out the guys and forge some bonds. Men, we are men.  \n  \nIn part 3, we'll hit some practicalities of being men running hard after Christ. Think \"spiritual IronMan\" (I hear the IronMan is no piece of cake...).  \n> \"Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, **act like men** , be strong.\"  \n> ~1 Corinthians 16:13 NASB"},"url":{"en-US":"men-we-are-men-pt2"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/men-we-are-men-pt2/"}}},

I was driving 55mph and apparently my right tires went off the shoulder. I over-corrected and hit a car head-on who was driving 45mph. I was not wearing a seat belt and they said I flew around the car like a ping-pong ball smashing my head into the windshield. I was in ICU, then moved to a normal room, and eventually was able to leave the hospital once I could make it down the hallway on a walker.  \n  \nWhat saved me was what I hit…an unmarked police car. The officer was actually able to radio in help faster than it would take for someone to realize to call 911. I should have died that day. My family, the hospital team, even the police officer all would tell you it is nothing except a miracle that I am here today. My sister said this to me this weekend: “It was all part of God’s plan as I see Him using you today.”<!--more-->  \n  \nShe reminded me that this wreck lead to me marrying the guy I was dating at the time, which lead to my divorce, which lead to my life spinning out of control until the Lord brought me to my knees in complete surrender to Him. The reason I tell you this is because I can’t tell you why or even how I managed to live through that accident. It is only by the grace of God.  \n  \nIt truly is unexplainable, but undeniable!  \n  \nSometimes in life we want to know the why’s or how’s, but I agree with David Marvin when he said, \"MORE IMPORTANT THAN KNOWING ANSWERS IS KNOWING HIM.\"  \n  \nJohn 9 goes through the story about the blind man who Jesus gives sight to and no one can explain it so they have a hard time believing it. I can totally relate to this. I can’t explain how the Lord saved me that day, and I can't explain how he has now changed me so very much (2 Corinthians 5:17), but He has. He continues to do things in my life that I can't explain and I see his plan play out more and more as I spend time learning about and following Him. I used to not understand why bad things have happened in my life, but now I see him using every single one of those times for HIS GLORY and MY GOOD. I still have tons of things I don’t understand either in the Bible or life in general, but I KNOW CHRIST and He is GOOD.  \n  \nI pray that in our search for wanting answers and explanations we wouldn't miss out on knowing God.

I asked my group of friends who were also involved with the bible study if my date and I could be in their group for Prom. They said no and that the group was already full. I was extremely hurt and frustrated by my \"good Christian friends\". From that point on I was so turned off by this whole religious thing. I just didn’t understand.  \n  \nThere were two more times in my life I remember specifically being frustrated with the church or religious people that caused me to want nothing to do with God. One time where I actually asked my church why we did certain traditions and never really got an explanation, and another where someone from one denomination told me I was going to hell because I was another denomination. I just didn’t understand.  \n  \nDavid’s message this week reminded me a lot of these times in my life where my frustration with religion and religious people caused me to throw my hands up and walk away from God. I had put Christ into this religious box and threw him out with religion.<!--more-->  \n  \nPaul also wanted nothing to do with Jesus. He even says, \"I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. And that is just what I did in Jerusalem.\" He imprisoned people, voted for people to die, punished and persecuted people, all in opposition of Jesus. (Acts 26:9-11)  \n  \nJesus came to Paul and asked him why he was doing all of this (Acts 16:14). In the same way I feel that God brought me to a place where I was tired of fighting against him…tired of turning my back on him…why was I rejecting him?  \n  \nYou see the problem with throwing Christ out with religion is that \"Jesus did not come to give a religion, but to restore a broken relationship.\"  \n  \nJesus said to Paul, \"I am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.\"  \n  \nHE CAME SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE FORGIVENESS.  \n  \nThere may have been times in your life where religious people frustrated/hurt you, but don’t put Christ into the religion box and throw him out. Doing that you are rejecting forgiveness and relationship.  \n  \n\"Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin.\" (Acts 13:38-39)  \n  \nPraying for you all~"},"url":{"en-US":"dont-put-jesus-in-the-box"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/dont-put-jesus-in-the-box/"}}},

It was an amazing morning of loving on and playing with boys and girls ranging from probably 3 to 15 years old. And it didn't end with soccer, football and crafts.  \n  \nI had the privilege to join Chris L. and Cody B. (fellow teammates) as Cody led a small group discussion with two of the older teenage boys about what God says in the Bible about love. These kids (and we ourselves) are surrounded by the message that love equals sex, and that we give merely to get. With these two brothers, we walked through 1 Corinthians 13, 1 John 4, and John 13 to see what love truly is--God sending Jesus to lay down His life, loving one another, and a patient, self-sacrificing care for others.<!--more-->  \n  \nAll the while, the women from our team partnered with other Solomon's Porch volunteers to teach the younger kids stories from the Bible. It was beautiful.  \n  \n[![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//solomonsporch2.jpg \"Crafts\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//solomonsporch2.jpg)The funny thing is that this Saturday wasn't an exception or a one-time event. Sidewalk Celebration & Solomon's Porch happen every Saturday morning, and folks like our teammates Heather, Cody, and Chris make it a regular part of their life to get involved. Just three or four miles south of some of the richest parts of Dallas, those of us who came for the first time found neighborhoods where drug deals are common business and prostitution is alive and well. In fact, the apartments just behind the field where we played are home to many of both.  \n  \nThe message that hit many of us was that we don't have to get on a plane or cross an ocean to meet people in need. Just take US-75 south to I-30W, exit Ervay and go south a mile or so. It's right there. Oddly enough, you actually might be safer going to South America or Asia to carry the gospel... But the truth is: wherever God has you is the safest place of all to be.  \n  \nSo what are you doing Saturday? Can you, your friends, or your community group give a morning to pour into your south Dallas neighbors' lives?

The girl he loves is brutally killed. So what does he do? First, he avenges her blood by taking out the guy who murdered her. Second, he rises up against the empire and teaches others how to fight. And finally, he gives his life and dies for the cause. He wasn't a marine, but that deserves an \"Ooh-rah!\"  \n  \nThe apostle John had those same three points (okay, with slight variations) in mind about 1100 years earlier when he wrote 1 John 2:12-14. Know the truth. Fight for the truth. Teach the truth.  \n> I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for His name's sake. I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. ~1 John 2:12-14<!--more-->  \nBefore you skip over the \"little children\" and \"fathers\" parts, understand that these are _spiritual_ maturity levels, not physical life stages or ages. I am certain that little children, young men, and fathers are reading this--and may all be similar ages (or the opposite of what we'd think). The three categories are a progression, and nothing holds us back from pursuing the next one.  \n  \nBut what's the difference between them? Just like in life, when we come to Christ, we start as children. We learn the truth--Jesus came, lived perfectly, died for our sins when we couldn't, rose from the dead, and represents those who trust in Him before God the Father. Do you know that? If so, that's awesome! Now it's time for children to grow up.  \n  \nYoung men are strong and they overcome the devil. Paul encourages them to be \"good soldiers\" and run hard like Olympic athletes (2 Timothy 2:3-5). What beats Satan and evil? From Ephesians 6, we see that it is faith, truth, righteousness, the gospel, and the word of God. Have you learned how to wield your sword (the Bible)? How's your faith? Are your knees well worn from time spent talking & listening to God (prayer)? Mine aren't worn enough...  \n  \nFinally, fathers. You've fought for years and are an expert swordsman. As you look around, you realize there are a lot of new soldiers and kids with less experience and knowledge than you. Have you started teaching them yet? Sure, there are commanders (pastors) and men older and even more experienced that you are, but that doesn't exempt you. Step up, men! Think of it as spiritual war college with training in tactics, discipline and passion to conquer evil and please our Commander In Chief (Christ). It's good stuff! Are you in it? Are you doing it?  \n  \nI'll wrap up with some words that puritans wrote some 400ish years ago. A great reminder that we aren't fighting alone. Our God leads the charge...  \n> O Lord God,  \n> Thou art my protecting arm, fortress, refuge, shield, buckler.  \n> Fight for me and my foes must flee;  \n> Uphold me and I cannot fall;  \n> Strengthen me and I stand unmoved, unmoveable;  \n> Equip me and I shall receive no wound;  \n> Stand by me and Satan will depart;  \n> Anoint my lips with a song of salvation and I shall shout thy victory...  \n> ~The Valley of Vision (Conflict)  \nMen, we are men."},"url":{"en-US":"men-we-are-men-part-3"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/men-we-are-men-part-3/"}}},

This was normal most places I’ve walked into in life. Whether it was a bar, a class room, or a meeting I’ve always been fairly social. I’ve also felt terribly alone, and like no one really KNEW me. No one knew my fears, insecurities, and struggles. No one knew what was going on behind my smile. No one knew what I was most proud of or knew the kind of woman I truly wanted to be. I’ve often felt the loneliest in a room of crowded people. That was until I got connected here at Watermark.<!--more-->  \n  \nAs I meet with people every week no matter what the subject matter is I always recommend the same thing: Get into community. Get connected. That is what has helped me the most.  \n  \n[![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//685955_scarf.jpg \"Knit Together\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//685955_scarf.jpg)<small>\"that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God’s mystery, which is Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.\" (Colossians 2:2-3)</small>  \n  \nWhile being connected to other believers \"you’re pointing other people to Christ and their pointing you to Christ.\" Serving in the church and being connected has finally given me accountability, encouragement, and allowed me to be transparent. Some people don’t like accountability, but I see it as a perfect way to be sharpened and grow more like Christ. I’ve loved being able to see God work through my friends, and help transform my life into one with much less stress, guilt, regret, confusion, and loneliness. I’m finally becoming the woman I’ve always wanted to be: a follower of Christ serving God and his people. I’m finally content and have peace. I am more patient, more loving, and more forgiving.  \n  \nTo be honest there are times when I am tempted to go back to doing things the way I used to. I get impatient with God. I’ll think about going back to the bar scene, or dating just date, or spending tons of money on a new wardrobe. In those times I have to remind myself of Proverbs 26:11. My community points me back to Christ and reminds me like Mike reminded us, \"Treasuring Christ will always give you something that last. When you’re treasuring something in this world it will always say NOW and it will NEVER last.\"  \n  \nNo matter what I am tempted with my treasure is Christ (Matthew 6:19-21), and my eyes are fixed on Him (Hebrews 12:1-2). Christ never said following Him would be easy (example: Jesus and his disciples), but he promised it would be worth it. I wholeheartedly agree. It’s so worth it. (Hebrews 10)  \n  \nYou may be networked, but how many people are you deeply connected with?  \n  \nPraying for you all~"},"url":{"en-US":"lonely-in-a-crowd"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/lonely-in-a-crowd/"}}},

If we have fallen short of His standard (perfection) we don’t want what’s fair. We want MERCY. Fair says you mess up, YOU pay. Jesus says you mess up, I’LL PAY. Here’s the problem: You don’t think you’re ungodly. We compare ourselves to others and think, 'well, I’m not as bad as him/her.'\"  \n  \nWhat made me smile as I stood there taking it all in was thinking about how Jesus came to save me, Lowston, Mitchell, and even the drug dealers and prostitutes.  \n  \nI couldn’t look at myself as any better than anyone out there. We are all sinners in need of a Savior, Jesus Christ. We don’t have to travel to another country to share the GOOD NEWS that while we are still sinners, CHRIST died for us!

That everything about our lives would be changed because of the real and personal experience we have with what Jesus Christ has done on the cross. Jesus did not die in vain, he died for a purpose.

The problem is we all want to do something great, but few of us yield to the one true source of greatness, GOD. As JP went through Acts 16 and shared the first three members of the church in Europe (Lydia who sold clothes, a demon possessed slave girl, and a prison guard) it reminded me of Psalm 51:16-17 that says:  \n> \"You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.

(Matthew 22:38-39) Once I was all in and willing to submit to Christ, I’ve seen God do great things in my life and those around me who have done the same. I’ve come to understand that a God who endured suffering, can understand ours. Even in tough times I’ve realized that \"peace cannot come without grace. There has to be grace for there to be peace.\" In Christ you find peace (Philippians 4:7).  \n  \nLately, when I struggle with being single, I find comfort in knowing that God knows exactly what I need and provides just that.

The load, or weight, or burden of my neighbor’s glory should be laid daily on my back, a load so heavy that only humility can carry it, and the backs of the proud will be broken.  \n>   \n> It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which, if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship, or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare. All day long we are, in some degree, helping each other to one or other of these destinations. It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities [_indeed one or the other is an eventuality_], it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all our dealings with one another… all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics.  \n>   \n> There are no _ordinary_ people.  \n>   \n> You have never talked to a mere mortal.  \n>   \n> Nations, cultures, arts, civilization—these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit—immortal horrors or everlasting splendors.  \n\ni. Set your mind on what matters.\n\n  \n2 Corinthians 4:16-18  \n> 16 Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. 17 For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. 18 So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen.

Every day His love and power knock me for a loop. Some days, like today, He is more than I think I can take.  \n  \nFrom the Bible, we know that God can heal us and speak to us through the Holy Spirit (see John 14:26; 1 Corinthians 12:1-11). In my own life, God has completely reversed cycles of depression, removed intense, unexplained physical pain, and spoken prophetically into my life through song and Scripture. Recently it seems like God is choosing to speak to and heal me in a new way. I hate when He does that--just when I seem to have figured Him out and have put Him safely in a box. :-)<!--more-->  \n  \nI am going through [Celebrate Recovery](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/care/celebrate-recovery/) (CR), and in so many ways, God is using that program to open doors in my heart. In the last few years, God has claimed many victories in my heart. My anxiety, however, has been a deeply planted seed and has begun to erupt uncontrollably, in public, where God knows I can't hide it. Awesome. In my prayer time I pleaded with God to take this away. Like so many other struggles I wanted my anxiety to die quietly, hidden in the dark recesses of my prideful self. But God has had a different plan. I see now that God has been opening the closet of my heart and saying:  \n  \n_\"Eww! Look at this, it's old and nasty and ugly and it doesn't look good on you. Remember last week when you wore it? Mhmm, yeah, NO. I'm throwing it out. Watch me throw it out. See? GONE.\"_  \n  \nI want to bag up my stuff--my old way of doing things, my old life and my sins--but God wants to showcase the changes He is making in my heart and my life. He makes a point with each piece. Before my eyes (and everyone else's) He is proving His love, faithfulness, power and grace as He cleans out my heart. How dare I try to hide what He is doing! Jeremiah 17:11 comes to mind: \"The heart is desperately sick, who can understand it? I, the LORD, TEST the heart and SEARCH the mind and give to every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of His deeds.\" He does it. His way for His glory.  \n  \nBy hiding my struggles, I am cutting short the story of grace God is trying to tell through my life. Now I see why I sometimes don't know with how to share God with those that don't know Him. How silly! If you were to see me face to face, as I'm writing, I know you would see the laughter and freedom, the joy and tears, the miracle of Jesus. I have no doubt you would see it.  \n  \nSo I continue to learn how to live honestly and humbly before my friends, my family and my God.  \n  \nI pray that the fear of your struggles would leave you as well, and that the power of the Holy Spirit, actively transforming you and proclaiming you as God's masterpiece, would infect your heart and mind--for His glory alone.

This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God (know that Christ is victorious…our example in suffering). 29 For it has been granted (\"granted\"--_echaristhe_ (Gr.) comes from the word that means grace/favor) to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him, (suffering is not a punishment from God, but can actually be a kind of God’s favor) 30 since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have (be encouraged, Paul is enduring).  \nMark 10:35-45...  \n> 35 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. “Teacher,” they said, “we want you to do for us whatever we ask.”  \n> 36 “What do you want me to do for you?” he asked.  \n> 37 They replied, “Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.”  \n> 38 “You don’t know what you are asking,” Jesus said. “Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?”  \n> 39 “We can,” they answered.  \n> Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with, 40 but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.”  \n> 41 When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. 42 Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. 43 Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 44 and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. 45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”<!--more-->  \nPhilippians 2:1-5...  \n> 1 If (“since”) you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, 2 then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose.

When you use those gifts in a self-serving way it is just as scandalous. RADICAL.\n\n  \nLuke 14:7-11  \n> 7 When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable: 8 “When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited. 9 If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this man your seat.’ Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place. 10 But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests. 11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”  \nLuke 18:9-14  \n> 9 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable: 10 “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’  \n> 13 “But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’  \n> 14 “I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”  \nMatthew 23:8-12  \n> 8 “But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have only one Master and you are all brothers. 9 And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. 10 Nor are you to be called ‘teacher,’ for you have one Teacher, the Christ.11 The greatest among you will be your servant. 12 For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.  \n\nv. Adopt the mind of Christ\n\n  \n\n1. Big lofty goal.

He emptied Himself, divested His self interest, but not His deity; \"emptied\", Greek: _kenoo_, _kenosis_) taking the very nature (form) of a servant, being made in human likeness. (He surrendered His right to manifest Himself visibly as the God of all splendor and glory. “likeness”: similar, but different--sinless)  \n> 8 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death—even death on a cross! (despicable)  \n**II. Christ’s Example: Humiliation**  \n\na. Nature=Form, Form of God and Form of a servant.\n\n  \n\ni. Was fully God and fully man\n\n  \n\n1.

Kenosis: but made himself nothing (lit. “emptied Himself”, emptied Kenoo)\n\n  \n\ni. He didn’t do this to pretend to be less then what He was: false humility\n\n  \n\n1.

He forfeited His right to manifest Himself in all splendor and glory\n\n  \n\na) Was in human likeness, but was sinless.\n\n  \n\nc. Died the most despicable death\n\n  \n\ni. There is not equivalent today for the crucifixion. It was a public humiliation for the worst of crimes.\n\n  \n\n1. Romans could not be crucified\n\n  \n\n2. Naked\n\n  \n\n3. Usually never had a burial; burned outside the city\n\n  \n\n4. “so disgraceful, it should not even be on the lips of Romans”\n\n  \n2 Cor 5:21  \n> 21 God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.  \nQUESTIONS:  \n\n  \n- Why did Jesus have to Die? Why couldn’t God just waive His hand and forgive?  \n\n  \n  - Answer: Because an offense against God needs a punishment because God is just. A just God requires a payment. Example: If you hit my car, someone will pay. You will pay, I will pay, insurance will pay, I’ll sell it for less…someone pays. I can forgive you, but God is perfectly just: forgiveness requires a payment.\n  \n  - Also--the gravity of the offense. I trespass in my neighbor’s yard, not a big deal. I trespass on the Whitehouse lawn, I get shot. Our offense was against the President of creation (God).\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n- Why did Jesus need to be perfect?  \n\n  \n  - Any other sacrifice would have been under the same judgment. It is like if I have a death sentence and you have a death sentence, I can’t pay your death sentence for you. In order to satisfy God’s wrath forever, God had to become man in the exact representation of us.\n  \n  - The payment was more than if you or I did this, because He could stop it at any time.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nPhilippians 2:9-11...  \n> 9 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place (Acts 2:33, Heb 1:3)  \n> and gave him the name that is above every name,  \n> 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, (will bow willingly, or they will be made to do so)  \n> in heaven and on earth and under the earth,  \n> 11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,  \n> to the glory of God the Father. He is Yahweh-God. All will confess, but for some it will be too late.  \n**III. Christ’s Prize: Ultimate Exaltation**  \n\na. He triumphed over evil. Also set in our hearts. Osama Bin Laden\\> we celebrate.\n\n  \n\ni. We love justice but we don’t want it for ourselves.\n\n  \n\nii. We want the throne.\n\n  \n\nb. THEREFORE: He is exalted in the highest place\n\n  \n\ni. Our best example of greatness falls short.\n\n  \n\n1. Prince William? 2 Billion people?\n\n  \n\na. OVER 106,456,367,669 will bow to Christ\n\n  \n\nc. Everyone will either bow willingly, or be made to\n\n  \n\nd. Everyone will confess He is LORD\n\n  \n\ni. But for some it will be too late\n\n  \n\ne. The cross was the means to glory. Pursuit of glory by any other means will miss the cross.\n\n  \nSummary:  \n\n  \n- Paul said be humble like Christ\n  \n- Christ gave up everything just to save you\n  \n- And ultimately you can have all that He has, but the road to it is different than you might think.\n  \n  \nMatthew 10:38  \n> \"anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.\"  \nMatthew 16:24  \n> “If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.  \nThe distraction to the cross is the throne.  \nThe cross is the means to the throne.  \n  \n1 Peter 5:6  \n> 6 Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.  \nYou will worship or you will be made to worship.

It is a funny story and I definitely would love to share it sometime, but as the week has gone by the Lord has really put it on my heart to share about my sweet cousin Betsy.  \n  \nOur family has always said that Betsy and I are a lot alike in personality. Strong willed, will say how we feel, and enjoy being social. She is three years younger than me and almost six years younger than my sister so we’ve always felt like she looked up to us, but I’ve truly grown to admire and learn from Betsy the past six months.  \n  \nNovember 20th, 2010, my 24 year old cousin was five months pregnant with twin boys Easton Craig and Benjamin Parker. That day she had complications and gave birth to her boys who did not make it. Her faith during this time is truly inspiring. Here are a few lines from her blog ([http://blmccoy.blogspot.com/2011\\_01\\_01\\_archive.html](http://blmccoy.blogspot.com/2011_01_01_archive.html)):<!--more-->  \n> _I’ll never forget Doctor G. telling me, \"It’s time to push\". When a woman hears these words it’s usually when she is about to give birth to a healthy, breathing baby. This was not our situation. Trent and I both knew without asking that our children wouldn’t live. We knew they weighed right at a pound, but were still four weeks away from viability. This began the worst hour of my life…_  \n>   \n> _[![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//ECBP1.jpg \"ECBP1\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//ECBP1.jpg)Dr. G. then began to cry. She was truly devastated and hurt by what had happened. She felt so bad and I knew she had done everything she could have. This wasn’t her fault, it wasn’t my fault, it wasn’t anyone’s fault. God just needed my boys more than I did. They were His before they were mine and Trent’s. God knew we would only carry them for five months and that they would forever live in our hearts…_  \n>   \n> _I am so glad that God put Trent in my life. He is a great husband and father. We prayed daily over these boys, with him initiating the prayer. That’s a real man in my eyes. One who isn’t afraid to pray, even when nurses and doctors are waiting…_  \n>   \n> _We give God all of the glory for the five months that I was able to carry Easton and Parker and we will continue to praise Him in this storm._  \nMy cousin and her husband are the real deal. They are ALL IN for Christ and are leveraging everything to advance the Gospel. If you look at their blog it is filled with praise, joy, and scripture like this:  \n  \n\"I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.\" –Romans 8:18  \n  \nThey have boldly shared their faith and encouraged the hospital staff, our family, and all of their friends. God is using them in a HUGE way and I am challenged.  \n  \nAM I LEVERAGING EVERYTHING FOR THE GOSPEL? ARE YOU?  \n  \n\"Your greatest frustrations/sufferings are your greatest opportunities to advance/share the Gospel. For you to be Christ in the situation and God to be glorified.\" –JP  \n  \nI encourage you to go back and listen to JP’s message from this past Tuesday.  \n  \nPraying for you all~"},"url":{"en-US":"they-were-his-before-they-were-mine"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/they-were-his-before-they-were-mine/"}}},

Instead, believe in them. They need you. They may look a little different, but what is on the inside is very special.  \n  \nTo the older generation: If you're not dead, you're not done. The Spirit that raised Christ from the dead is still working in you. And you are probably more attune to His voice because you've listened longer.  \n  \nInstead of delegating tasks, give responsibility. Tasks create followers. Responsibility creates leaders.  \n  \nGod used a 75-year-old man to shatter Craig's paradigm.  \n  \nBe real, be authentic. Authenticity trumps cool every time.  \n  \nPsalm 71:18, Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, so that I may declare your power to the next generation. (invest in the next generation!)  \n  \nTo the next generation: primary term used of this generation: \"entitled\". You feel like you deserve everything. In Craig's generation, you actually had to win something to get a trophy.  \n  \nBecause you feel entitled, (in ministry) you don't think there is a cost to be paid. You think you should have it all now. You often overestimate what God wants to do in the short run. You are also underestimating what God can and wants to do through you in the long run.  \n  \nHow can we lead up (influence those above us)? By honoring them. Because the emerging generation feels entitled, it often doesn't show honor. How often do we treat our leaders as common or ordinary? The one placed above us has been put there by God. There is nothing ordinary about them. See Jesus' experience in His hometown of Nazareth (Mark 6:4-6). Honor builds up, wants the best, values others. Show honor before you think it is deserved. Some of us need to repent for withholding honor.  \n  \nThe next generation (our generation) may be a little messed up and immature, but it is the most cause driven one that sees a problem and says, \"not on my watch!\" Craig: I believe in you!

We live in a lukewarm society so we think it’s okay, but Revelation 3:15-16 says, 'I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth.'\" (JP)  \n  \nI agree with JP; lukewarm Christianity sucks. It wears you out. The world and your walk with Christ both lose because you can’t enjoy either. Far too often we become cultural Christians. We say we are a Christian because that’s all we’ve ever known, but there is no heart connect. Our lives don’t reflect that of Christ, and we try to play the game half way. The thing is you can’t play halfway. Christianity isn’t something you tack onto your life. It isn’t a trailer. It is your whole life. We are called to live out our faith, to actually live like we believe in what we say is true. <!--more-->  \n  \nI remember a couple years ago when I finally surrendered to Christ, I had a really tough time. As Christ changed my heart and my desires I started to feel pulled between hanging around my old crew that I used to party with and having a hard time trusting new people that I would meet at church. I continued trying to fit in both places, one foot in and one foot out. I realized after failed attempts at being a part of both worlds that I wanted to be all in for Christ. I knew what the world had to offer and I was tired of the temporary satisfactions that never led to peace and joy. It hasn’t been easy, but God doesn’t call us to be comfortable, in fact he tells us it will be difficult, but he promises that it will be worth it. And you know what? It is SO WORTH IT!  \n  \n\"As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God. For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do—living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry. They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, and they heap abuse on you. But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is the reason the gospel was preached...\" ~1 Peter 4:2-6  \n  \nAs JP went through Philippians 2 last Tuesday, one thing really stuck out: \"Christ is enough. We don’t live like we believe this. We think we need Jesus AND (a relationship, job, car, money, popularity, looks, etc). We live like He’s not enough.\"  \n  \nTo be honest this is something I still have to work through. There are times when things don’t go how I’d like them to and I get discouraged. In the moments of disappointment, I sometimes act like Jesus isn’t enough, but when things don’t go my way it’s not for me to understand, know, or plan. The right thing for me to do is shine.  \n  \nPeople are watching us who say we are Christians, are we shining for him?  \n  \nOne thing I have to do is check myself with these questions: Am I worrying more about myself, a guy, money? Or am I spending time with and serving the Lord trusting that God is enough and he’s got me?  \n  \n**God is faithful and worth going ALL IN.

He gave a great illustration of the Royal Wedding and how Kate, the commoner, [![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//144807_king_of_magic.jpg \"144807\\_king\\_of\\_magic\")](http://www.sxc.hu/photo/144807)became royalty and how we all love that Cinderella story. We all long to sit on the throne. We love when the underdog wins, like Rudy! It’s engraved in us, but in a different way than we too often think. We are sons and daughters of THE KING. We inherit HIS kingdom, HIS righteousness, HIS glory...not because of anything we’ve done, but because of what Christ did on the cross.  \n  \n“I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.” (Galatians 2:20)  \n  \nChrist humbled himself and gave His life FOR YOU. Have you reflected on the cross lately? <!--more-->  \n  \n“God is worth so much more than a hand raise, church attendance, and casual confession. He is worth absolute abandonment.” –David Platt  \n  \nIn which way are you living your life: Here I am to be worshiped, or here I am to worship? Scripture tells us, “Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me’.” (Matthew 16:24)  \n  \n“We miss the cross because we want the throne.” –JP  \n  \nWe want His blessings, His joy, His peace, but we don’t want to humble ourselves. God is very clear on how He opposes the proud, exalts the humble: Luke 14:11, Luke 18:14, Matthew 23:12.  \n  \nIt is crazy how bad we miss the mark, how bad we make this life about us instead of loving God and loving others. Being selfless isn’t thinking less about yourself, it’s thinking about yourself less. Craig Groeschel made a great point at Catalyst that the biggest struggle with our generation is the sense of entitlement. We seem to think that we deserve so much, and judge others quickly. Can you see Christ and His children, or are you too busy thinking about yourself? Please know that I am asking myself these same questions. My prayer is this:  \n> _Lord, I pray that we would be a generation that is not selfish, but one that is full of love, compassion, and selflessness. That we would see others as children of God, not judging or ignoring them. I pray that we would use all the gifts and talents the Lord has given us to advance His Kingdom and glorifying His name. Father I pray we would humbly come before you, realizing the greatness of the Gospel. Reflecting and always remembering that you, fully deity and fully human, were crucified on the cross for us. That through your resurrection you defeated death...death that we so greatly deserve. I thank you for your never ending grace and love. I pray we wouldn’t miss the cross chasing after the throne._   \n>   \n> _Here I am Lord, send me..._"},"url":{"en-US":"royal-wedding-cinderella-rudy"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/royal-wedding-cinderella-rudy/"}}},

I used to have Christianity as an accessory in my life. Christ definitely wasn’t the first thing I thought of when I would wake up in the mornings, nor did I look to Christ to guide my life and satisfy me. I was on my agenda trying to accomplish as much as I could in trying to win the approval of others whether it be for a relationship, my parents, or to gain a better job.  \n  \nIt’s funny how we cling onto our past accomplishments and like to talk about them like it actually matters. Living in the “good ole days” or the “glory years”. My resume or life on paper would look pretty good: graduated college in three years, Masters degree, successful job positions, know some pretty well to do people, and have gotten to go to some cool places, and experience fun events. From the outside looking in things look pretty good. The problem is I was always searching for something that would satisfy. All those things just left me wanting something more, something that would make life worth living for…\"complete me,\" like Jerry Maguire would say.<!--more-->  \n  \nI’ve found what’s worth living for in Christ Jesus and Him alone. I can say with full confidence the past two years have been the best of my life. Hands down. It hasn’t been because of any worldly accomplishment. It hasn’t been because I am working the dream job. It hasn’t been because I found an amazing man. It is because I have fallen in love with Jesus. I truly do agree with Paul when he says:  \n  \n“But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith. I want to know Christ…” –Philippians 3:7-10  \n  \nUnfortunately, “we pursue pleasure in the moment and we don’t hold out for the ultimate. So we continue to sell ourselves short. Our desire for pleasure is not too great. Our desire for pleasure is too small. We settle for good, when we should wait for best.” This has played out in my life in the form of relationships. I guess you could say that is my Achilles heel. Instead of holding out for a great Godly man I have far too often settled for the attention of whoever was in front of me now. I still struggle with this some, but as I’ve focused on Christ it has been so so so much better. God has grown me, and as I am more in tune with His word I am able to stay strong in holding out for best and not settling for good.  \n  \nI thank God for the time that I have had being single. I have taken the time to allow God to restore me and make me new by dealing with hurt, pain, and shame from my past. I am finally free from the things of my past that owned me. I clearly see that all the other things in my life that I thought were so great only distracted me from the love of Christ. Now when I wake up in the mornings instead of starting to think about all the things I have to get done, or worrying about a guy, I pray. I thank God for this day and ask him to use me in some way. I pray that I wouldn’t be distracted and that I would:  \n  \n“Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD.\" Psalm 27:14  \n  \nWhat do you think about when you wake up?  \n  \nWhat do you spend most of your time thinking about? (Yourself, your job, a guy/girl, your to-do list.)  \n  \nHonestly, do you have Christianity as an accessory in your life? Or do you want Jesus more than you want anything else in this life?  \n  \nThis is my prayer for us all: “Let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” –Hebrews 12:1-2"},"url":{"en-US":"in-love-with-jesus"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/in-love-with-jesus/"}}},

We love to live in the past and tell people what we accomplished. High school trophies. Hunting big game trophies. In Dallas, we become our own trophies here, at the gym, at the lake, on resumes. JP got the religion award 8 of 9 years in Catholic school. How weird is that?  \n  \nWe love to perform for a prize. But when you bring that into the gospel, it says, \"Jesus Christ, you're not enough\". It belittles the gospel.  \n  \nThe Prize That We Play For (Phil. 3:1-14)  \n  \n1) A prize not earned (3:1-6)  \n- Judaizers said it was the gospel plus something else  \n- Paul calls them dogs and mutilators of the flesh  \n- these are the people that Jesus went after and told they didn't have it figured out  \n- think about what you would answer if God asked why He should let you in  \n- if you thought anything other than the work of Christ, you're them<!--more-->  \n- it's not about these things (circumcision, works, etc)  \n- Paul's preaching against that; and it still happens today  \n- we have this idea in the church that if I perform well, God is going to bless me specifically  \n- God loves you because of Jesus, not your performance  \n- illustration: Presley holding her breath under the water at the lake  \n- - to show that it isn't about what she does, though, JP tells her at home that he loves her regardless  \n- God loves you because of what He's done for you through Jesus--that's the good news  \n  \n2) A prize found through faith (3:7-11)  \n- compared to Jesus, everything is rubbish (crap)  \n- Paul knew with all of his heart that Jesus was the best thing for him  \n- ...more important than a wife, friends, popularity,...anything  \n- C.S. Lewis: our desire for pleasure is not too great, but too little--we don't hold out for enough  \n- illustration: JP asking Finley if she wants to live in the condemned house with the red slide  \n- - she forgets and discards everything she has at home to have the red slide in front of her  \n- - we do the same with sex now over a good marriage in God's time or porn or attention  \n- we don't understand how Christ is good, because we only have the scale of this life as \"good\"  \n- Paul had a greater revelation of who and what Christ was, because he lived for Him and pursued Him  \n- the one who has everything, the house, the car, etc, but not Christ, has nothing  \n- the one with the condemned house yet Christ, has everything  \n- when you woke up this morning, was Christ your greatest desire?  \n- Paul is describing not just an emotion but a devotion; everything falls under the shadow of Christ  \n- we pursue Him out of a realization of the gospel  \n- yet we pursue Him how we see Him pursued around us  \n- illustration: JP's grandmother playing bingo and JP observing that people shout \"bingo\" to get a prize  \n- - he didn't understand that you have to have the bingo on the card  \n- - a lot of us observe Christians and then do church, etc and try to please God that way  \n- - we start pretending, not truly loving God through Christ  \n  \n3) The prize is what we strive for (3:12-14)  \n- the prize is Christ  \n- if you don't want Christ today, you don't want heaven, because heaven is more of Christ  \n- and if you don't want heaven and Christ, study the Scriptures and understand what it is all about  \n- Heb. 10:19-25:  \n- - our confidence comes from Christ; He is our motivation; He is coming back and every person will meet Him and He is going to judge us (that's not popular)  \n- - forgetting our past; odd because we are often called to remember; we are to forget our accomplishments (Gal. 6:14); shame: \"forget\" doesn't mean to push it down; it means don't let it own you  \n- - God is in the business of restoring; He is bigger than whatever you've done; confess it and be made new; you think you can't tell anybody--you can  \n- Heb. 12:1-3:  \n- - we know Jesus is good because of everyone who has interacted with Him, lived for Him, died for Him, trusted in Him  \n  \nJP's last week: the hardest of five years of ministry because of others in ministry going through difficulties and protecting the flock from predators (those here with the wrong motives). The encouragement from the men around him in his life was to not grow weary in doing good (Gal. 6:9), and to look to the prize and the witnesses of those who went before.  \n  \nChrist is the vehicle we are driving in.

She said that my friend Bree was a perfect example of what it looked like to live out Psalm 27:14  \n\n**“Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord.”**\n\n  \nI sat there in that moment and thought through am I truly living out this scripture? Do I wait for the Lord?  \n  \nTo be honest, I could use some work when it comes to waiting. I hate waiting in line, waiting for someone to call me back, waiting at the doctor’s office, waiting in traffic...waiting is just not fun. It seems like it is much easier to just take action and will our way through life than to be patient and wait. As I’ve dated I have often called Bree to chat about frustrations when things don’t work out with a guy or work out the way I would like them to. She always ask me this, do you trust God? Do you believe God has best for you? <!--more-->  \n  \nMy answer is, YES. Then I need to be strong in the Lord and take heart knowing that he is faithful and his timing is different than mine. I need to wait for the Lord.  \n  \nI have found that true strength is found in waiting for the Lord. Our society would tell us otherwise because we have gone into instant gratification mode. The mode of do what you want now and deal with the consequences later. We settle for decent or good because it is right in front of us, rather than hold out for best. The lack of patience though is often the cause of many of the worst sins and regrets in life.  \n  \n“We think it is being strong to take action and move ahead, but often that is the weakness of the flesh. It takes more courage and strength to just hold back from action and let God work according to his time table rather than ours. Waiting can be the hardest thing we can do, and we have to be strong in faith to do it.”  \n  \nOur Bible is filled with scripture about waiting for the Lord (See: Psalm, Proverbs, Isaiah, Lamentations, Hosea, Micah, Zephaniah, Acts, Romans, 1 Corinthians, 1 Thessalonians, Titus, Jude, Revelations), and examples of people who did wait for the Lord (See: Abraham, Noah, Joseph, Job, Prodigal Son’s father, Paul, etc)  \n  \nGod himself is an example of waiting. He has not come back for judgment yet because he is patiently waiting for all to repent and come back to him so that we will not perish. Praise God for his patience with us and that the final judgment has not come.  \n  \nWe all have things that we would like to happen now. Maybe it is a relationship, a new job, a pregnancy, someone to forgive us, but whatever you may be waiting for be STRONG in the LORD, take heart, and know that God’s got you and is up to something even greater than you can imagine.  \n  \nBree waited patiently for the Lord and he answered and brought her a great godly husband. I can tell you though that even if that hadn’t happened yet she would still be waiting patiently with full trust that God is good and knows best. I praise God for the example that she has been to me of a godly woman and pray that I too would wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart, and wait for the Lord.  \n  \nDo you wait for the Lord or do things your way?  \n  \nDo you trust God and believe that he has best for you?"},"url":{"en-US":"wait-for-the-lord"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/wait-for-the-lord/"}}},

Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things. But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ…” –Philippians 3:18-20_**\n\n  \nWriting this week my heart breaks as did Paul’s in his letter to the Philippians because a majority of us are “living as enemies of the cross of Christ” without even realizing it. Here’s a question for you, and take some time to think through this and be honest with yourself:  \n\nHow many of your decisions are based off of making yourself happy? How many are based off of glorifying Christ?<!--more-->\n\n  \nI think far too often even our efforts to please others, make them happy, have them like us can often be in opposition of glorifying Christ. We’ll do and say things just to have others like us, get promoted, or be talked about knowing that it is not glorifying to the Lord. Then we justify it because it “wasn’t that big of a deal” or it made someone else happy/feel better. We are distracted by our physical appearance, social status, careers, and dating relationships that following Christ falls down to the end of our “to do” list. When Paul says “their stomach” it means their appetite or their desires. We get so distracted by the “get mine” mentality of what we want or what this world tells us we need that we lose focus of what really matters. It's scary how quickly we become \"enemies of the cross\". We trust God with our eternity and say we want Heaven, but don’t trust God with today and live to glorify Him. How crazy is that? What a humbling thought to realize how much time I’ve wasted thinking/worrying about myself instead of spending more time growing and learning about God. The God I get to spend eternity with.  \n  \nIt’s tough. I mean it. It has been tough to look into my own life and realize the areas that I have continued to live in a way that is not glorifying to the Lord. I so easily get distracted by things that truly do not matter. Have you ever worried about something and let it upset/bother you so much, and then a couple months/years later realize it was so stupid to worry about that? Focus on the things that matter, the things that matter for eternity. Turn off the TV, get in the Word. Stop gossiping about people, pray instead. This week has been so much sweeter as I’ve focused on things for eternity, and slowly all the distractions start to fade into the background of the great light that is Christ in my life. I know I can't change on my own or flip a switch and stop being distracted, but I've seen that when I come to Him...He changes me. It is awesome.  \n  \nI loved David's question to us on Tuesday night, “What did you do this past week that matters for eternity”?  \n  \nMy prayer for all of us is that when asked that question we could daily say that we are doing things for Christ, doing things that matter.  \n\n“The strength to live for Christ today is knowing that he is coming tomorrow.”- David Marvin.\n\n  \n\nHe is coming back and, **_“He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” –Romans 21:4_**\n\n  \n“Don’t make much of yourself; make much of your God.” He is what matters. This is not our home, our citizenship is in Heaven.

Obsession over Jesus leads to peace.”**\n\n  \nI worry far too often. Does my outfit make me look funny? What do people think of me? Did I hurt someone’s feelings? Am I making my parents proud? Does God want me to be single forever? I admit I worry. The problem with this is “worry is a sin in that it proves we doubt God’s character.” I’ve heard JP say it before and truly believe that “the opposite of loving Christ, is loving self.” We are our own worst enemy. If we could take our eyes off ourselves for just a minute and fix them on Christ we’d allow peace to come into our lives. If you look back at the worries above, they are all about me...

Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” –Philippians 4:4-8_**\n\n  \nI can remember many times saying to friends, “I wish I just didn’t care. I wish I didn’t worry.” As they have continually pointed me to the cross, and I’ve drawn near to God, he has provided such unexplainable peace. I used to be filled with worry and anxiety, but I’ve grown in the area of trusting in who God is and who I am in Christ. I’ve gotten much better at letting go and letting God, no longer trying to will my way through life and chasing after “mine”.  \n  \nPart of that worry has played itself out in that I know many people, but very few people actually know me. Or as Matt said on Tuesday, “Many people know about you (thanks to Facebook), but few people know you.” Even as I blog each week and have shared parts of my testimony there have been many times where I feel that yes, people know about my past, but does anyone really know what I am feeling today? PRAISE GOD for faithful friends who have come along side me and spoken truth into my life. Friends that have taken the time to just sit with me, listen, and pray. Friends that don’t care to gossip or talk about meaningless things, but rather talk through what truly matters…how am I doing? How is my relationship with Christ? What is God teaching me lately? Praise God for brothers and sisters in Christ.  \n  \nDo you have those friendships? Are you in community? Better asked, is your own pride, fear, insecurity, getting in the way of allowing others to speak truth into your life? Or even worse, is pride, fear, insecurity getting in the way of you drawing near to God? You’ll find peace there if you can get past yourself.  \n  \nFather, I pray for those reading this…each and everyone. I pray that they would know they are sons and daughters to You their King! I thank you that we have never walked alone and that you continually are there waiting for us to turn around and trust you. God you are good, faithful, loving and worthy of all our praise. I thank you that we do not need to worry, you’ve got us, and you are continually growing and making us closer to your image. I pray that we wouldn’t worry and become distracted by work, relationships, and our own selfishness, but that we would trust in You always. Christ you are all.

Today as I hiked up the mountain to spend some quiet time with God the words free and freedom just kept coming to mind. Perhaps it was because I felt so free as I hiked, free of worry, free of a \"to do\" list, free to just climb, and obviously the freedom we are celebrating this 4th of July.<!--more-->[![](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//allyvail-300x225.jpg \"allyvail\")](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/2011/07/sacrifice-for-freedom/samsung-3/)\n\n  \n\nAfter I had some quiet time and started thinking about this devotional, I thought it would be fun to ask random people what they thought of when they hear the word freedom. Children seemed to answer either \"I don't know\", or \"I get to do what I want\". Our generation and the generation above us mostly answered along the lines of \"the opportunity to do things\", and one father even answered his son's answer of \"I don't know\" with \"Son you do know. You get to play outside, and do what you like to to\". The people in our grandparents generation that answered seemed to have a very different idea of freedom. Their responses were more similar to this, \"The men and women who have and still fight for and protect our freedom\", and my favorite response that got me thinking \"SACRIFICE\".\n\n  \n\nTo be honest, we have a lot of work to do. I was shocked that children had no idea why we celebrate the 4th of July, and even more shocked that the parents weren't taking the opportunity to explain to their children, but rather encourage them that they get to just do what they want. We should be in such gratitude for those who fought for our freedom and continue to protect that freedom. This freedom we have isn't free...there is sacrifice.\n\n  \n\nThe difference in the older and younger generations is that the older generations have experience great sacrifice, some in ways we could never imagine. While our generations far too often have the sense of entitlement. As I sat there spending time reading my Bible and praying I started to think of what my first thoughts would be if someone asked me about the word freedom. My answer would have been: incredible gratitude for our military, for the generations before us that have sacrificed so much and worked so hard, and more than anything freedom I have found in Christ. We've all experienced the freedom that comes from living in the USA, the land of the free and the home of the brave, but have you truly come to understand and experience the freedom found in Christ??\n\n  \n\nThe Declaration of Independence says, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that the are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\"\n\n  \n\nAs JP went through part of Philippians 4 last Tuesday he also mentioned this idea of the pursuit of happiness and that it actually is a chase of happiness and that would mean you are never happy in a way that satisfies. Contentment however would mean that you can be content whatever the circumstance may be. Paul talks about the secret of contentment and that it starts in the mind. Contentment will not ever come from what you have. It is a state of mind. Are you chasing happiness by just doing what you want? Or are you following Christ and finding freedom in Him in a way that no matter what comes your way you know that you have all you need in Christ, that God's got you, and are truly content?\n\n  \n\n_\"To the Jews who had believed him. Jesus said, 'If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.' They answered him, 'We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be free?' Jesus replied, 'I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.'\"- John 8:31-36_\n\n  \n\nJesus Christ was the ultimate sacrifice. He gave his life so that our sins would be paid for once and for all. (Romans 6) We have been given this right by our Creator to walk in that freedom, not freedom to just do what we want in ways that do not glorify Him, but rather freedom from sin and freedom to follow Christ and worship!\n\n  \n\nFather I thank you for the men and women who have given their lives to fight for and protect our freedom. I pray that you would continue to protect those still serving and be with their families. I humbly thank you for the greatest sacrifice of all, your Son Jesus Christ and the freedom we have in Him. I pray that you would continue to bless this country, not in a way that we would ever think we don't need you, but in a way that would grow us and bring us closer to you. I am forever grateful that we live in place where we are free to worship, and pray that we would be a light in this world for You. I pray we would never lose sight of the sacrifices made for our freedom. In Your holy name I pray ~Amen.\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"sacrifice-for-freedom"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/sacrifice-for-freedom/"}}},

It's the same way with discipleship--both mature.  \n- what is your practice? What are the things that mark your life?  \n- Paul is saying that the things that you see me do, put these things into practice  \n- 1 Tim. 6:6  \n  \n3) Contentment Whatever The Circumstances (v10-13)  \n- contentment will never come from what you have  \n- contentment is a state of mind  \n- Prov. 27:27  \n- Story: when JP moved to Dallas, he thought he could by enough stuff that would make him content. JP has been driving for 14 years and been in 16 cars. He has had 5 houses here. Over 20 motorcycles. And it's stupid. It doesn't fulfill anything. None would fulfill so he would go from one to the other.

The promise keeps passing down through the generations into Exodus where the nation of Israel is in bondage to Egypt. God sends Moses to lead out the people after the plagues convince Pharaoh to release them. After they are free, they are in the desert and God provides. Then Moses is called up to the mountain to talk with God, and God gives him instructions for the tabernacle and law. While he is gone, the people lose faith and ask for a leader and god--after seeing all that God had done and promising to follow Him. In response, God tells Moses to go down and lead them into the promised land but says that He (God) will not go with them.  \n  \nWho is with us is more important than where we are or where we are going.   \n  \nRole-play illustration:  \n- Date 1: best circumstances; shallow, selfish guy  \n- Date 2: very basic settings; sweet, caring guy  \n  \nMoses wanted more than the blessings of God.

His mom couldn't get it open. His dad got the ladder, climbed in the window, and opened the door. Larry (kid) ran down to play again, forgetting all about it. Reflection: as a Christian, it doesn't work like that. God doesn't run in to unlock the door. He comes into it to sit with us (and for us to sit with Him). His invitation is for us to sit with Him, to know Him better, and to understand He is enough in the world.  \n  \nWhat would someone in your circumstances do if they were confident that God was with them?  \n  \nGo and do that thing.   \n  \nMatthew 28:18-20  \n- Jesus is with us to the very end of the age  \n- it's not the end of a silly Disney movie  \n- He. Is. With. Us.   \n  \nImagine how life would change if we embraced that. How different would you spend your free time if you believed that? How could things change if we really believed that anywhere or anything with Him is better than anything or anywhere without Him?\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"notes-who-is-with-you"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/notes-who-is-with-you/"}}},

As I type that it's funny because I've never thought too much about the statement \"full of life\", but that actually could translate to full of the Spirit.\n\n  \n\n_\"The Spirit gives life...\" -John 6:63  \n  \n<!--more-->_\n\n  \n\n_\"...through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.\"_ _-Romans 8:2_\n\n  \n\nI loved Adam's question from Tuesday, \"What would you do if you were confident that God was with you?\" I started thinking about the friends in my life that seem full of life...full of joy and I truly believe that they too live as though God is with them always. It is so contagious being around these people that are full of love, joy, excitement, compassion, and laughter. Life is sweet being around them. Unfortunately many of us often let our circumstances dictate our happiness, forgetting that God is with us and has best for us. When any sort of adversity comes our way we pray that God would please change our circumstance, and when things are going well we start getting complacent and ask God for more. We continually look for and pray for God's blessings to satisfy us rather than God himself. Think about that statement for a second...we look for and pray for God's blessings (Him to change things, give us more of things) to satisfy us, rather than being truly satisfied with God himself. I'm not sure about you all, but that is pretty humbling to realize.\n\n  \n\nDo you truly believe that God is with you ALWAYS?\n\n  \n\n_\"Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authoiry in heaven and on eath has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. **And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age**.'\" -Matthew 28:18-20_\n\n  \n\n\"Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you...The LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.\" -Deuteronomy 31:6&8\n\n  \n\n\"No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of you life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" -Joshua 1:5\n\n  \n\n\"Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.'\" -Hebrews 13:5\n\n  \n\nThere was a long time where I couldn't wrap my head around this idea that God was always with me. That he would never leave me nor forsake me. It wasn't until I truly took the time to understand our Lord and his character that I was able to see that God has always and will always be with me through the good and bad times, and when I have a lot and when I have little (Philippians 4). I've learned that even the times when I felt completely lonely, broken, and helpless...God was there. He probably was sitting there broken hearted with me, saddened at the poor decisions I have made or others have made that have brought saddness. God was always waiting for me to turn to Him and trust Him, and once I did he has redeemed and restored every bad situation I've been through. He didn't change the circumstances or give me more worldly blessings, but He gave forgiveness, peace, and finally joy. I'm not sure what you may be going through, but I know God is with you always. Be satisfied in HIM, be full of LIFE!\n\n  \n\n\"Here in the desert with you God is far better than the promise land without you...Anywhere with God is infinently better than anywhere without God.\"\n\n  \n\n_\"O LORD, you have searched me and you know me. You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways. Before a word is on my tongue you know it completely, O LORD...Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are thee. If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, eve there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast. If I say, 'Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night aound me,' even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you. For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.\" -Psalm 139:1-14_\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"full-of-life"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/full-of-life/"}}},

My answer is always, “I’ve never been a part of a church where I truly felt cared for until I came to Watermark. Here I've found the church body lives out their faith through transparency, community, accountability, grace, and compassion.” I realized this past Tuesday that I should also add generosity to that list. Before having a relationship with Christ we often live our lives consuming all we can with a “get mine” mentality, and taking/buying way more than we need. As we grow in Christ we start to give more, serve more, and love on others more intentionally. <!--more-->As I listened to JP’s message last Tuesday on generosity I had an overwhelming sense of gratitude thinking about all the people here that have been so incredibly generous to me since I started coming to The Porch/Watermark.\n\n**_“Generosity meets the needs of others. Generosity is an investment in the Kingdom. Generosity comes from God.” –JP_**\n\n  \nSo often we think of generosity as just being about giving money, but often times generosity is shown by giving of your time, engaging in conversation, and meeting people’s needs. I’d like to take this opportunity to say thank you to a few people that have been so generous to me, and who continue to encourage and challenge me by the way they give to be more generous myself.  \n\n_ **“GENEROSITY MARKS THOSE WHO KNOW AND TRULY BELIEVE THE GOSPEL.” -JP** _\n\n  \nJanet Godby- I haven’t known Janet that long, but from day one of meeting her I realized just how truly selfless she is. We were in the car together and I overheard heard her having a conversation with someone and anything they needed she would respond, “Sure! I’d love to help. Just let me know what you need.” Since then I have consistently seen her live this out. Janet constantly goes out of her way to serve others. She cooks for people, spends time listening to them, and even has made people cd’s of Christian music they can workout to. Thank you Janet for all you have done for me and how without even knowing it you’ve challenged me to give even more of myself to others.  \n  \nChris Gurley- We have served together here at The Porch and Chris has continued to stand out as a servant leader. He is someone who serves so much and does it often times without people knowing how much he is truly doing for this ministry and for others. He’s become a dear friend and is always there to check on me, pray for me, and even bring me coffee on days when I’m not feeling well or need a little energy. If you’ve ever been around him you probably too have a story about how he’s generously given of himself too. Thank you Chris for being such a great example of living generously, and giving so much to others.  \n  \nJonathan Pokluda (JP)- I couldn’t thank people and not include JP. One thing I love about serving at The Porch is the example JP is to us all. Not only does he share with us incredible truths every Tuesday night, but he leads us so well in giving us an example of what it looks like to follow Christ. As he spoke Tuesday I started thinking of the ways he has lived out this message of generosity. He has always been there to challenge me, answer emails, take time to talk through my questions, offer forgiveness, and encourage me to grow in Christ. He truly pours himself out into this ministry. Having served with JP for over two years and gone on two mission trips where he’s lead I am constantly in awe and challenge by the way he generously gives to all those he meets no matter where he is. Thank you JP for not just preaching a good message on generosity, but truly living it out as well.  \n\n**_“A generous man will prosper; he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.” –Proverbs 11:25_**\n\n  \n\n**_“Give generously to him and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.” –Deuteronomy 15:10_**\n\n  \nI actually have an a very long list of people I could have included here including Melissa Rubin, Kiersti Orr, Lauren Godby, Joe Waters, Jon Lantz, and all of those I have the privilege of serving with at The Porch. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generosity and for being an example to myself and all those around you of what it looks like to live generously. I feel blessed, encouraged, and challenged at the way you have given, and love that we can follow your example as you follow Christ.  \n  \nHere are some questions for us to continually think through:  \n  \nWhat do I have to give?  \n  \n_We all have something whether it is time, money, food, extra clothing, a helping hand, a smile, and prayer. See Romans 12._  \n  \nWhy am I not giving?  \n  \n_Any reason you come up with is an excuse. We all have something to give and trust me when I say, you aren’t truly experiencing life until you are generously giving to those in your life. It brings much joy!_  \n  \nWhat are you holding onto so tightly that it will hurt if the Lord takes it from you?  \n\n**_“I've learned that we must hold everything loosely, because when I grip it tightly, it hurts when the Father pries my fingers loose and takes it from me!” –Charles Swindoll_**\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"are-you-generous"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/are-you-generous/"}}},

I can say one thing for sure though, I can say with certainty that I felt the Holy Spirit moving through me and the whole Porch. I felt an excitement that was beside myself. It wasn’t because of something I was doing, but it was an excitement for everyone who was declaring publicly that they were going to follow Christ, as well as all who were listening.  \n\n[vimeo clip\\_id=\"26708394\" width=\"384\" height=\"216\"]\n\n  \nI tried to think about what baptism meant to me. Why was I doing this? Baptism would not save my soul. For Christ alone has died to save my soul. For me, baptism was a big step to tell the rest of the world that I was now a Christ follower. After rejecting God for 30 years I had seen how He can heal us and the grace and peace that He brings to all our lives.  \n  \n<!--more-->In being baptized we are publicly declaring how Christ has changed our lives. My mother and my step father are recently learning of my life changing experience. My mother came last Tuesday to see everyone get baptized. She got to hear the message of the Gospel and to hear the testimonies of the three who shared. I was so excited to publicly share with her how Christ has saved my life.  \n  \nA song that sticks in my head all the time is “Awake My Soul” by Mumford and Sons. I love the opening lines to that song. \"How fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes, I struggle to find any truth in your lies.\" It reminds me that left to my own desires my mind and eyes will wander and I may stumble over Satan's lies. I certainly didn't view baptism as any sort of destination like \"I've been baptized, now I'm saved, I can relax\", but after Tuesday I just felt again how God was waking up my soul and renewing my body. To see again that following Him is the way to true life while the alternative simply leads to death and destruction every time.  \n  \nSo what do we do with this life now that we have been baptized? On one level it's pretty simple. Love God and obey His commandments, 1 John 5:2. My sinful nature, though, will make this simple charge a hard one to keep. By being baptized into Christ publicly, I have invited everyone to speak truth into my life if I am getting off course. This public declaration is important if we are going to be held accountable. It is similar to being in community. We love each other, so we will sharpen our brothers and sisters when they become dull.  \n  \nOverall, I don’t feel as though I have arrived or completed any event for which now I have received a reward of relaxation or anything like that. My soul is awake and I have declared to the world that it is God who has saved me through his Son. I feel a new fire inside that is fueled by the Holy Spirit. This fire burns so that I will think less of myself and remember to serve the kingdom."},"url":{"en-US":"awake-my-soul"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/awake-my-soul/"}}},

JP's parents have two cats and Presley and Finley love playing with them. What this means: cats absolutely HATE Presley. Presley doesn't know how to love cats--she grabs them by the fur, throws them, etc in her attempt to love them. While she thinks she is loving them, she is hurting them. In the same way, we as young adults don't know how to love each other.  \n  \nIf you are here and you want to be loved or to love somebody, that is okay. It's good. It's how God designed it to be. But before you can return that love or give it, there are things that we need to understand from Scripture and what the Lord has said.  \n  \nAre You Ready To Love? (1 Cor. 13)  \n<!--more-->  \n1) Is Your Love Right or Wrong? (v1-3)  \n- Paul is saying that you may be the slickest talker in the world and say amazing things, but if your heart is not right and your motive not pure, it's just noise  \n- it comes on fast with emotion, but doesn't last  \n- it's the motivation of your life for the moment  \n- that can be an extremely addictive thing and feeling  \n- you may spend your entire life chasing that feeling--it fades like a clashing symbol!  \n- when it fades, there has to be a commitment  \n- illustration: song by Keisha, \"Your Love Is My Drug\"  \n- - terrible song but it is true  \n- illustration: Eminem, \"Love The Way You Lie\"  \n- - tragic but true, because the world has taught me otherwise  \n- we keep going back like a dog to it's vomit to bad relationships  \n- you have to get well and take a season to work on you  \n- some of us want something so bad that we are hurting people and hurting ourselves  \n- that isn't meant to discourage you, because there is hope--Christ  \n- the reality is that we want to be happy and want to be filled  \n  \n2) Are You Ready To Love? (v4-7)  \n- v4-7, that's what love looks like  \n- what do we value most? We value passion and chemistry  \n- passion and chemistry can be created and comes easy, esp when you start doing things you shouldn't be doing  \n- that's what they do on \"The Bachelor\"  \n- love is patient, love is kind--it doesn't come naturally  \n- it is something that we work for  \n- Questions:  \n- - are you patient? Are you a patient person?  \n- - are you kind? Are you jumping on service opportunities?  \n- - are you easily angered? Can you go from zero to frustrated like the snap of a finger?  \n- - do you take pride in being the sassy one?  \n- - do you keep track of people's wrongs and remind them of it?  \n- - do you find joy in other's failures?  \n- - do you play games?  \n- - are you concerned about the well-being of others?  \n- - do you trust?  \n- - are you willing to push through difficult life circumstances with someone?  \n- you don't want to date someone with the intent of trying to change them  \n- you trust that the Spirit will continue to conform them to Christ, but you accept them as they are  \n- music: if your music calls women \"hoes\" or worse (objectifying people), don't listen to it  \n- why would you celebrate that for which Christ died?  \n- if your music is causing you to objectify the opposite sex, you're being sold  \n- this love does not play games, Rom. 12:9  \n- this love is sincere--it doesn't play hard to get  \n- this love is true, truthful, intentional  \n- this love protects, guards hearts, Prov. 4:23  \n- - if you're \"just friends\" and it's a guy and a girl, very likely hearts are running  \n- - you may protest, but look back--how's that working?  \n- you were meant to be attracted to the opposite sex, not friends  \n- you don't see a lot of guy-girl friends in Scripture  \n- guys: be intentional, let them know where they stand  \n- girls: guard your heart, if you know you can't just be friends with that guy, don't  \n- trust: you need to learn to trust, not to trust on someone  \n- take 12 months and go to re:generation on Mondays  \n- be patient and take a break from dating to get well  \n  \n3) Are You Preparing To Love? (v8-13)  \n- the Scriptures are about your relationship with God through Christ  \n- it is all about Him, not your relationships with people  \n- ask your community, ask others: do I love others well? Does loving well mark me?  \n- illustration: a guy told JP the other day that he hates having roommates--don't get married  \n- every problem that JP has observed in a marriage was brought into it  \n- Gal. 5:22-23, 1 John 4:7, love comes from God  \n- this is one of the reasons why we as believers only date believers--because only believers can love this way  \n- work on your relationship with God  \n- God loves you SO MUCH and sent His Son, His most prized possession, to die for you  \n- you are loved and you can love! 1 John 4:19, take a season to learn that...  \n  \nInterview with couples who are married and who JP has observed them dating and then married  \nQ1: what single people problems did you bring into marriage?  \nA1: Greg: tend to be hard on people; Brandon: harshness; Sammy: selfishness, doing what I wanted when I wanted, even the small things like leaving on the lamp at night  \n  \nQ2: what are your thoughts on casual dating?  \nA2: Katy: Scripturally, dating is intentional toward marriage, which is the opposite of casual; Crystal: I dated a lot of people before Sammy and wish I could have wiped out about 70% of them because they were short and casual, and I didn't know how to work through those challenges and conflict  \n  \nQ3: if I truly have a desire for a life partner, will God bless me with that someday?  \nA3: Alicia: God does not promise marriage in Scripture, but God is faithful to satisfy us--He should be our lover now and if/when I marry; JP: I don't know--it's up to God  \n  \nQ4: for those who are intended by the Lord for marriage, do you think God has a person in mind for me to marry?  \nA4: Brandon: no, I don't believe that's true. My wife is my life partner and because of that commitment, she is the one. JP: is there someone out there better for my wife Monica than me? Absolutely. There's someone more compatible out there, but I am not worried about it. There is a pool of people out there--those committed to Christ--who you can marry. \"The one  \n  \nQ5: how do I respond when I go on a date with a guy and he says he isn't ready for commitment? Why is he dating?  \nA5: Crystal: red flag! Greg: guys, if you don't see yourself going in that direction, then take a season off. Katy: if you're a woman, understand your worth in Christ and keep dating (not that guy, another guy)  \n  \nQ6: I simply don't command as much attention as others with money. Is there a spiritual solution to this?  \nA6: JP: no. You don't want to date women who are interested in your money.   \n  \nQ7: what advice do you have for keeping a long-distance relationship growing together in Christ with all the miles in between?  \nA7: Sammy: it's hard and you have to work on it. Prov. 3:5-6. You can leverage it to work on communication.   \n  \nQ8: should having sexual intercourse \"accidentally\" with someone once affect your future relationships?  \nA8: JP: first, that wasn't an accident or mistake. You made that choice. You have to own it. Alicia: I made that choice and had to work together with Greg through that. I checked with my community and determined it was the right time to share with him. Greg opened up the Word and focused on forgiveness and grace. There is a man who is out there who will know he is just as much a sinner and understands grace in Christ. Brandon: it isn't a comfortable or fun conversation to have. You don't have to have that conversation on the first date. You should have the conversation at the right time and place, and understand that the ground at the foot of the Cross is level. We are all guilty yet redeemed in Christ. Katy: there is hope and redemption. JP: you're getting a lot of our opinion and a lot of it aligns with God, but test it all. If your relationship is heading toward the long-term, share and make sure they know that.   \n  \nQ9: many peers of mine think that a desire for a relationship is a lack of security or completion in Christ. What should I do?  \nA9: unless they are saying that you aren't ready (i.e. get well), then no, that isn't correct unless God has given you the gift of celibacy.   \n  \nQ10: I've decided to wait to kiss until I marry. Am I being too legalistic?  \nA10: Crystal: cheers to you. Scripture says to flee youthful lusts and kissing rarely stops there. JP: I just officiated a wedding with people who waited and they didn't have regrets, even though people thought they were crazy.   \n  \nQ11: is online Christian dating Biblical?  \nA11: Sammy: there is a way that can be done wisely and a way to abuse it. A lot use it to shack up. Reputation is important (as JP said last week) and all you have is their profile. But there can be a way to do it safely with friends, etc. JP: it seems like a shortcut but we aren't ready to knock it.  \n  \nQ12: how do you know when you've found the one?  \nA12: Greg: I just knew. I did things that were uncharacteristic of me. I'm a planner and over-analytical, but I came back from the first date and said I'm going to marry her. Crystal: my whole life I grew up in Christian family, college, etc. But I was always the spiritual leader. Then I met Sammy and all the things that my church and family said exist as a godly man were in Sammy. Don't compromise. He was pursuing purity and godliness wholeheartedly. You will know it.  \n  \nYou are loved by the Creator of the universe. Pursue Him.\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"boy-meets-girl-part-2"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/boy-meets-girl-part-2/"}}},

I can honestly say since elementary school I’ve been trying to understand relationships… and I am still learning.  \n  \nI’ve been the “co-dependent girl”…the “I went to college in the south to get my BS degree and my MRS. degree”…the “Sex and the City girl thinking I can beat you at this game before you hurt me”…and finally (Praise God) am to the place where I am complete in Christ (Colossians 2:10).  \n  \nTo be honest with you all, although I’ve found my identity in Christ alone, I am a little afraid to open up to a real relationship because I am more comfortable being single where I won’t get hurt or possibly hurt someone else.

Knowing and trusting in Him.  \n  \nBelow are just some quotes from JP’s Summer Lovin series back in 09 and from a book I am going through now by Beth Moore called _So Long Insecurity_:  \n\n“Men are not our problem; it’s what we are trying to get from them that messes us up. Nothing is more baffling than our attempt to derive our womanhood from our men. We use guys like mirrors to see if we’re valuable. Beautiful. Desirable…” -Beth Moore\n\n  \n\nIf you don’t have a right relationship with God, dating…it’s only going to distract you. –JP\n\n  \n\nGod is love. You want to know how to love, you’ve got to go to the Father. -JP\n\n  \n\nThe greatest thing you can do for them is understand how God loves you. And be complete in that, the reality is that person cannot complete you. You’re looking for them to meet a need that can only be met by God. –JP\n\n  \n\nI can't wait to start the series tonight, and to share again with you all next week! Praying for our time together now~\n\n  \n\nAlly\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"you-complete-me"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/you-complete-me/"}}},

Whether it is in regards to shopping or dating I have been talked into \"needing\" something I actually don't need. I love that JP started our first message with you have to know what you are looking for before you shop, or you will be lured into all sorts of things you never really wanted/needed to begin with. Knowing what you are looking for in someone you'd date is so very important, otherwise you will fall for anything. Sadly, for a lot of women instead of knowing what we want we in a man we just want attention from any man. We wait for the next guy who will give us any attention, the next guy who will say anything that makes us feel like we are special...even if for just a day. This commonly will lead women into liking how a guy makes us feel, instead of actually liking the guy for who he is. The feeling card starts to trump the reality card and that's when you really know there is a problem.  \n\n**_\"Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.\" - 1 Timothy 4:12<!--more-->_**\n\n  \nJP gave us great biblical truths as to what we (both guys and girls) should look for in someone we would date straight from 1 Timothy 4:12: SPEECH, CONDUCT, LOVE, FAITH, and PURITY. (You can check out the last blog post for all of his notes on each of these.)  \n  \nOne of the best things I did for my dating life was to take a break from dating. I know that may sound weird to some of you, and to be honest I didn't love the idea when community around me recommended it. All I knew is that I was tired of dating the same way I always had and getting the same outcome. Something had to change and I was exhausted spinning my wheels with no real progress.  \n  \nWhat lesson in your dating life do you feel like you have to keep learning? What pattern can you see that has led you frustrated/hurt? Are you still dating in the same way and expecting a diffrent outcome? Are you dating someone who's reputation is unhealthy relationships, and like in _He's Just Not That Into You,_ hoping to be the exception to the rule?  \n  \nI think as a society we bounce from relationship to relationship just killing time, and thinking that we'll just know when we meet \"the one\". A huge problem with that is that we are carrying a ton of baggage into each relationship and never really allowing any healing or growth. Have YOU taken time to deal with your own past issues? Are you the kind of person you are looking for? Both guys and girls I think would all say they want someone that is honest, trustworthy, not sleeping around, not selfish, not angry or always gossiping, and if you're reading this I'm assuming you probably want someone who is committed to loving and serving the Lord. How are YOU doing in those areas?  \n\nI love when JP said, **_\"You're not DQ'd forever. You work on you though, and then come back in the game.\"_**\n\n  \nYou have to know what you want, and you have to know who you are IN CHRIST before you really should start dating. You can't look to someone else for the love and completeness you can only find in Christ. They cannot be your savior, and you cannot be theirs.   \n  \nFar too often I see that we would rather have others approval and affirmation over the Lord's, and we settle for good rather than holding out for great. When we do this it shows our lack of trust in the Lord, and that should be our sign that we still have things to work on. Thank God that he is patient with us, even when we are extremely impatient with him and his timing. God is faithful, even when we are not. Praise Him for that truth.  \n\n_ **“We don’t love God for the way He makes us feel. We love Him for who he is-his character.”-JP** _\n\n  \nThe truth is there are sometimes where we don't feel like loving God because of our circumstances. Feelings change constantly, His character does not. James 1:17 TRUST HIM.  \n  \nPraying for you all~  \n  \nAlly  \n  \nAnd just for fun here is Joey from friends with \"How you doin\": [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc2Z7CL4Cv0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc2Z7CL4Cv0)"},"url":{"en-US":"how-you-doing"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-you-doing/"}}},

Deal with your baggage before you get there. There's a lot of baggage every week at The Porch; it's just easier to see the bags here on the stage. All our baggage does is conceal our dirty laundry. That's all it does. We all have baggage. When you stand at the altar before God, you want to have checked your baggage, you want to have checked their baggage, you don't want to bring it with you.   \n  \nWe've talked a lot about materialism in this series. And the truth is, the world's economy depends on you trying to hide your baggage. It depends on the person you pursue trying to hide their baggage. And it's going to help them to hide their baggage.   \n  \nChecking Your Baggage, adapted from a talk by Louie Giglio  \n- the way that you battle lies is with the truth. Go to Philippians 4:8.   \n  \nThe Baggage That You've Received From Your Parents  \n<!--more-->  \n1) Your Parents' Baggage  \n- the things your parents struggled with or maybe your grandparents struggled with  \n- it doesn't matter if you had fantastic parents; no one had perfect parents  \n- your parents are sinners  \n- your parents didn't make you a sinner but they gave you a buffet to choose from  \n- they helped you hone in on your sins of choice  \n- maybe your parents were materialistic or angry or worriers or apathetic Christians  \n- JP and Monica came from two different extremes of addressing conflict and avoiding it  \n- the lie: I have to carry my parents' baggage because they did  \n- the truth: Galatians 2:20, I check my baggage because it died on the cross  \n  \n2) Abandonment  \n- maybe your parents divorced or disappeared  \n- or maybe they were there but you didn't feel like they cared about you or that you were a mistake  \n- this is how this affects us and our relationships  \n- - we latch on to anyone who shows us attention  \n- - or we've been hurt and aren't going to let anyone hurt us or get inside us  \n- lie #1: I need someone to make me feel loved  \n- truth: Psalm 27:10, 68:5-6  \n- lie #2: I am afraid of getting hurt  \n- truth: Perfect love casts out fear, 1 John 4:18  \n  \n3) Enablement  \n- your parents don't want to be your parents, they want to be your friends  \n- when you got in trouble, they tried to hide it or redirect the blame  \n- you're protected from everything to protect their lives & images and yours  \n- somewhere inside of you, you wanted them to be parents, to care enough to discipline you  \n- Prov. 13:24, 22:6  \n- if this is you, this is how you respond: entitlement  \n- - it's my way or the highway because it's always been my way  \n- you're going to be a disaster in your relationship and marriage  \n- that whole entitlement thing will take you and your wife down  \n- you're not looking for a wife but a hooker, not a husband but a sugar daddy  \n- the lie: I need to get what I want so that I can feel loved  \n- the truth: Rom. 8:17, I can receive everything I need in Christ Jesus, Gal. 3:29  \n- - we deserve nothing but have everything in Christ  \n  \n4) Contingent Love  \n- performance-based acceptance  \n- \"I love you, but make sure you...\"  \n- your parents lived this way through you because they were either the best and want you to be, or because they weren't but want you to be  \n- we apply this to God and think He'll love us if we do things or act a certain way  \n- but He loves us based on our belief in His Son  \n- you never ever felt good enough  \n- the truth is that He loves you all the way right now  \n- some of us are so desperate for attention that we'll take it from anywhere  \n- the lie: I need to perform so that others with love me  \n- the truth: nothing can separate me from God's love, Rom. 8:38-39  \n  \n5) Abuse  \n- emotional, verbal, physical, sexual  \n- before you get married, make sure you've dealt with this--not hide it, deal with it  \n- if that isn't a part of your story, maybe God wants you to be a shoulder to cry on  \n- God is bigger than that and God is a God of compassion  \n- the enemy says you can't tell anyone; don't believe that lie  \n- John 11:35-44, He brings the dead to life!  \n- the lie: I am damaged and cannot deal with my abuse  \n- the truth: I am a new creation because of the abuse that Christ overcame, 2 Cor. 5:16-21  \n  \nYou think you are here because you're looking for a spouse, when you're actually here to be set free. Be married well to God.   \n  \nIf you aren't being discipled right now, if you're stagnant, then you're not being a follower of Christ.   \n  \nWhat can I do?  \na) Forgive your parents  \nb) Be in community--meet with guys/gals and ask them to point out the baggage in your life  \nc) Understand that you're a new creation--\"the ground at the foot of the cross is level\" (Brandon, 8/9/11)  \n- - take it to the cross of Christ  \n- - hang your parents' baggage on the cross  \n- - Jesus dealt with that  \n  \nIf your community affirms that you've dealt with your baggage and are ready:  \na) Guys: find the most solid girl you know, which you'll know because of the respect she has from others, and get to know her  \nb) Ladies: be the strongest girl you know\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"boy-meets-girl-part-3"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/boy-meets-girl-part-3/"}}},

We are the the common denominator to all of our relationships and at the end of the day the healthier we become, the healthier our relationships will be.\n\n  \nI remember sitting in JP's office back in 2009 and discussing with him how I didn't agree with the way he was telling us (young adults at The Porch) to date. I probably argued some of the same points you may be thinking, but he said something I couldn't argue with,<!--more-->  \n\n_\"You've done it your way for how long now? And how is that working?\"_\n\n  \n\nHe then gave me a verse that I've continued to go back to:\n\n  \n\n**_\"As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.\"_ _-Proverbs 26:11_**\n\n  \n\nI know that verse sort of sounds gross talking about a dog and vomit, but in the same way it is gross when we continue to do the same thing, continue the same sin pattern or continue to date the same way and expect different results. A first step is to take time to \"look backwards in the rear view mirror-and see the destruction\". What is your dating pattern? Are you addicted to the highs and lows of being hurt?\n\n  \n\n**What do you keep doing that you wish you didn't?**\n\n  \n\nIn order to move forward in a healthy way you have to deal with the past. You have to heal and be set free. Instead of allowing God time to heal us, we continue stuffing our baggage, trying to hide it, and carrying into the next relationship. Then we often times look to that person or frankly anyone who will give us attention to love us the way only Christ can. Your boyfriend/girlfriend can not be your savior and you shouldn't put that pressure on them to be because they will fail you...but CHRIST won't. I don't say fail you meaning that they will intentionally hurt you, but we are all imperfect people in need of a perfect SAVIOR, Jesus Christ. Whether it is past relationships or family issues, the only way to truly heal is to be open to looking at your past, and taking your baggage to the foot of the cross...bring it to Christ and allow him to heal you. For many of us that is scary because when we look in the rear view mirror it is not a pretty sight or it may be extremely painful, but you'll never be free from your past until you allow God to restore those areas of your life. NOTHING is bigger than the cross. There is NOTHING he can't REDEEM.\n\n  \n\n_ **\"For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men. It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope—the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.\" -Titus 2:11-14** _\n\n  \n\nWe often think if only I had that special person in my life to make me feel loved every day things would be great, but it is not another person in your life you need...it is Christ.\n\n  \n\nGod loves you RIGHT NOW, not some future version of you. He loves you no matter what your past looks like, and he will continue loving you every single day. Nothing can separate you from God's love.\n\n  \n\n_ **\"For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,<sup> </sup>neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" -Romans 8:38-39** _\n\n  \n\nAt the end of the same conversation with JP, he took his dry erase board marker and wrote two words:\n\n  \n\n**TRUST GOD**\n\n  \n\nDo you trust Him, or are you trying to control? Are you looking to Him to lead you and guide you, or are you doing what you want and asking Him to come along for the ride?\n\n  \n\nGod is good. There is nothing he can't handle, and nothing he is trying to keep from you. We too often settle for good, and temporary satisfaction, instead of realizing God wants GREAT for us.

(i.e. Telling a guy that they don't think he's in a place to date.)  \nThe only reason a girl would consistently turn guys down is unrealistic expectations.  \n  \n-Girls claiming a guy, because they like him  \n  \n-Girls taking a couple of dates too seriously  \n  \n-Guys are not intentional  \nGuys should be upfront about where they stand.

How long would it be until I felt at peace and true joy? <!--more-->What I didn’t realize is that part of the problem is that I had never dealt with pain from my past, and I had not turned to the Lord for healing, freedom, and grace. There were things I just didn’t want to face or let people know about.  \n  \nWhen Victor said, “you can’t live according to the labels people give you” I could totally relate. I have felt stuck and used to believe that I was identified by my divorce and my past. How could people ever see me differently? How could I ever see myself differently?  \n  \nThe truth for me and you is that our identity is in the Bible. It is in Jesus Christ. Not in our past or what we’ve done. You are a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). You are a child of God…forgiven…free…and in the process of being sanctified.  \n  \nWhat just seems too painful to face, and leaves you feeling like you’d rather just not deal with it?  \n  \n What are you keeping from others because you are afraid of what they would say? Or just afraid to admit?  \n  \nI had no idea how much of my life was affected by not dealing with things of my past, not healing, not forgiving, and not just bringing everything into the light. In the light…that is where grace is found, that is where healing begins. You see, God never intended your heart to be hard. He never intended us to hide things from each other, and Lord knows we can’t hide it from him. Trust Him. Give him that pain, hurt, or whatever it is that you have in the darkness.  \n  \n_<sup>“</sup>But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

When it rains, it pours? When the storms in life keep coming and you think, “ok Lord I’m not sure how much more I can take”?  \n  \nThen someone tells you, “When you are weak He is strong”. We hear that and far too often let that go in one ear and out the other without thinking much of this great truth.I can think of many times in my life, and to be honest the past couple weeks have felt like one thing after another keeps happening, and I wonder when I will have just one week of calmness…  \n  \nCheck out this song by Matthew West: [Strong Enough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8JsRxVczmQ) \\<- click for video<!--more-->  \n  \nAs I’ve talked with friends, and heard Todd preach this past Sunday about all that Ann is going through it seemed fitting to share with you about these storms in life. You see more than often we rely on our own strength to get us through the days. We try to control and do things our own, it’s funny how strong and in control we think we are.\n\n_“For the foolishness of God is wiser than man’s wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man’s strength.” -1Corinthians 1:25_\n\n  \n\n_“Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who trust in the multitude of their chariots and in the great strength of their horsemen, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel, or seek help from the LORD.” -Isaiah 31:1_\n\n  \nFinally in times of brokenness we look to God for his will, his strength, his grace, his peace, “God will you do anything to just get me out of this situation, or make this better, or bring this back, or take this pain away…God I can’t do this, I need you.” Oh how the Lord rejoices when we come to him and realize how much we need him.  \n\n_“Has not my hand made all these things, and so they came into being?” declares the LORD. “This is the one I esteem: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word.”– Isaiah 66:2_\n\n  \n\n_“But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.” -2 Corinthians 12:9-10_\n\n  \nI’m not sure why bad things happen, and why sometimes it seems like more than we can bare, but I know my God. I know who he is. I know that he hasn’t promised us an easy road, but he has promised to see us through everything (Isaiah 41:10). Things may not play out how we’d like, but his plan is greater than mine. He is good. He is faithful and I trust him. He is a strong tower, a refuge, when I can’t seem to find my way or have the strength to get through the day (Proverbs 18:10). I believe there will be a day where there is no more crying, no more pain, no more death, and He will make everything new (Revelation 21). I believe that Christ has victory over all, and I can't wait for that day to come, but until then I have to keep an eternal perspective.  \n  \nDo you believe God is for you? He is. Do you believe he loves you and is there to see you through? He loves you, and you are not alone.  \n  \nHow quickly we forget our SAVIOR. He is all we need. He is our strength, our hope, our trust, our everything. Have you forgotten him? Have you turned to him to help you through the storms of life? He understands your pain. Christ suffered. He is full of compassion and grace. He longs for us to rely on Him. That is why he suffered…a greater suffering than we will ever endure...  \n\n_Isaiah 53_\n\n  \n\n_Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not._\n\n  \n\n_Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all._\n\n  \n\n_He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away. And who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken. He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth._\n\n  \n\n_Yet it was the LORD’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,<sup> </sup>and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors._\n\n  \nHe understands your suffering. He will get you through the storms in life. The awesome thing is when you see God use those times of suffering later to help others and to comfort them. He redeems all and uses all things for His glory and our good. Believe that.  \n\n_We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life. Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead. He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us, as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many. -2 Corinthians 1:8-11_\n\n  \n\n**Praying for you all and that you would trust the Lord to see you through~**\n\n  \n\n**Ally**\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"im-not-strong-enough"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/im-not-strong-enough/"}}},

He takes that which has infinite value and cheapens it.  \nWhat does this have to do with dating?  \n  \nAs image bearers of God we move through cultures as ambassadors of Gods and we redeem it through our example.  \n  \nHe's showing himself by the way we work, by the way we date, by the way we breakup.  \n  \nRedeem, Renew, Restore, Regenerate, Reconciliation: Making things whole again.  \n  \nTherapeutic moralistic deism: We do good things because it will make our lives better. It's one of the biggest heresys to the gospel.  \n  \n1 Corinthians 5:11-21  \n  \nThe world is dead and fractured. We bring life to it once more. i.e. The prince waking up Sleeping Beauty, Freeze tag.  \n  \nWe don't date differently or keep ourselves pure because God said so. That would be good enough, but we do so because we are image bearers of God.  \n  \nGod is using us to bring life into a dead culture.  \n  \n-D.

He had some ability, but he wasn't patient. He didn't like how long it took. He teacher would correct the mistakes he made while being impatient. Some of his favorite parts of those paintings to this day are the mistakes that were corrected.  \n  \nMany of our dating/non-dating relationships are filled with mistakes that we want to correct.<!--more-->  \n  \nThere's only one semi-example of dating in the scriptures, i.e. Someone liking someone else for a period of time without getting married.  \n  \n-Esaw and Jacob (Deceiver)  \n- Jacob deceives Esaw into giving him his birthright.  \n-Jacob deceives their father into giving him a blessing instead of Esaw.  \n-Esaw wants to kill Jacob  \n-Jacob runs from Esaw and sets off to find a wife.  \n-Jacob runs into Rachel  \n-Jacob immediately shows off to Rachel by moving a rock, kissing her,and weeping aloud.  \n-Jacob worked seven years for Laban (Rachel's father) in order to marry her.  \n  \nLove can be a strong motivator. Love motivated Jacob to work, hold out, and not compromise. Delayed gratification.  \n  \nWe want what we want and we want it now. The pond that we can fish from is small (finding someone who is pursuing God).  \n  \nDo you know what you're looking for, and how will you know when you find it?  \n  \n-After the seven years Jacob got impatient.  \n-Laban switched out Rachel for his other daughter Leah (who had \"weak eyes\") in Jacob's haste.  \n-Jacob also married Rachel and loved her more.  \n-God opened Leah's womb, but Rachel was barren.  \n-Leah hoped that she could win Jacob's affection by having children.  \n  \nThis story is very sad.  \n  \nLust is anything we desire more than God. Lust makes a mess of things. They are untamed desires.  \n  \nGod sometimes puts people in our lives who are just like us, so that we can see how intolerable we are. Laban was placed in the life of Jacob (deceiver).  \n  \nGenesis 29:35  \nAnd she conceived again and bore a son, and said, \"This time I will praise the LORD.\" Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she ceased bearing.  \n  \n+Jesus was descended from Leah via Judah.  \n+We need to trust God.  \n  \nNotes By: D.

They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.<!--more-->** _\n\n  \n\n_Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion._\n\n  \n\n_Furthermore, **since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.** They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. **They are gossips, slanderers** , God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; **they invent ways of doing evil** ; they disobey their parents; they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. **Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them**.” -Romans 1:20-32_\n\n  \n\nMan, it is tough reading Romans sometimes because the truth almost feels like a slap in the face. How quickly we exchange truth for lies. We exchange eternal joys for temporary happiness. We exchange peace and freedom for guilt and bondage. We get it so wrong, and so often. We say we believe and then we do what we want, when we want, how we want...and to be honest...it's time we step our game up and live like we believe.\n\n  \n\nA lot of us have been jaded by imperfect people who have proclaimed to be Christians and failed us, hurt us, let us down...BUT those people are not our PERFECT GOD. He has not failed you. He has given his life for you and paid the penalty for our sin so that we can have eternal life. We can have freedom. Many of us confuse freedom. We think freedom comes in doing what we want, and often ignoring God. I loved JP's example from Tuesday.\n\n  \n\nSure you have the freedom to play the piano. You can walk up to it and start playing all you want, but it is going to sound terrible. In order for it to sound beautiful it takes discipline.\n\n  \n\nIn life we have the freedom to do anything, but we will make it terrible, mess things up, hurt others, and continue to hurt ourselves until we realize that discipline is good for us. God's word, teachings, instruction is good...it makes all things BEAUTIFUL. Maybe you don't believe me...Try it.\n\n  \n\nHere is another question...\n\n  \n\nDo you know that you were created in God's image?\n\n  \n\n**\"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.\" -Genesis 1:27**\n\n  \n\nAll of us are the image bearers of God. Wherever we are, what ever we are doing, we are to reflect that of Christ who created us in HIS IMAGE. The problem comes a lot of times when people don't take the time to KNOW GOD and therefore don't truly know how to REFLECT GOD. So some of us are doing a terrible job of being Christ's ambassadors.\n\n  \n\n_ **\"We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\"- 2 Corinthians 5:20-21** _\n\n  \n\nWith our co-workers, family, friends, relationships, breakups, and even with strangers we are to live as Christ ambassadors. We are to be filled with love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. (Galatians 5:22-23)\n\n  \n\n**_\"The Gospel doesn’t just reconcile you to God, it regenerates our heart and helps restore others to God. It doesn’t just affect our eternity. It affects how we live each day. We should be living as ambassadors, restoring this world to God.\"- JP_**\n\n  \n\nYou say you believe the bible, but are your friends, your own desires, or your culture a stronger influence in your life? Are you going along with what your friends do, or what ever feels good, or what our culture would say is acceptable? Are you living like you believe the bible?\n\n  \n\nYou were created in the image of God...how amazing and humbling is that. He loves you that much. Everything else was created, but we were created in his image and get to have a saving relationship with him! Get to know Him. Be reconciled to Him. Be redeemed. Be restored. Be renewed. And then help others find the freedom in Christ too.\n\n  \n\n[Hosanna- Hillsong United](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ajFnnKFivY)\n\n  \n\nPraying for you all that we would be a change in this city...for God's kingdom and our good~\n\n  \n\nAlly\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"trade-truth-for-lies"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/trade-truth-for-lies/"}}},

Yet she didn't know the whole story.\n  \n\n13 Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say that the Son of Man is?\"\n  \n\n14 And they said, \"Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\"\n  \n\n15 He said to them, \"But who do you say that I am?\"\n  \n\n16 Simon Peter replied, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"\n  \n\n17 And Jesus answered him, \"Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah!

However, very few are \"wearing the jersey\" or \"in the game\".  \n  \nThe world will know that we are his followers if we love one another.  \n  \nSecular Historians write that Christianity spread so quickly because of the love and compassion shown by Christian groups.  \n  \nChristian would meet together, read letters, and teach each other radical ideas regarding the treatment of others such as saying, husbands should love their wives as Christ loved the church.  \n  \nWhen plagues would spread most people in the affected towns would leave, however, the Christians would stay, care for the sick and get infected themselves.  \n  \nPagan groups began to imitate the moral character of the Christians, because they saw that was part of the reason for their explosive growth. This fact was even confirmed by the Roman Emperor Julian.  \n  \nChristianity eventually took over the Roman empire. Love toppled the most powerful empire ever known to man.  \n  \nThe churches in Galatia had a conflict regarding circumcision, and those who believed in faith plus circumcision won out. Paul challenged and changed this practice and wrote about it in Galatians. He also wrote about the things that really matter.  \n  \n\"Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.\"  \nGalatians 5:19-21  \n  \nWe naturally drift to chaos and destruction.  \n  \n\"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.\" Galatians 5:22-23  \n  \nImagine how much better the world would be even if people just followed the message about self-control.  \n  \nThe message is unnatural. We have a soul and a body, and anything that damages the soul, we stand against.  \n  \nEvery major revolution in history has had young unmarried adults at it's epicenter.  \n  \nWe have time, energy, and resources greater than any other demographic groups. We are a super church.  \n  \nAt funerals you never see pictures of the things we spend so much of our lives obsessing about. You do hear people stand up and talk about the lives that they lived and how they loved others. Deep down we understand what really matters.  \n  \nIf we're chasing after things that don't matter, working a job that takes up too much of our time and causes us to not be obedient maybe we need to consider a change.  \n  \nWe need to serve and love one another so that the world around us sees our hearts.  \n  \nJP:  \n  \nA great way to start is to serve in the church, but it shouldn't stop there.  \n  \n-Don't miss next week for part 2.

Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well.\n  \n\n15 My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth.\n  \n\n16 Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.\n  \n\nPsalm 139:11-16\n  \n\nYou are the only you. You are unique.\n  \n\nWhat we have to steward\n  \n\n1. Personality\n  \n\n2. Gifting/Talents\n  \n\n3. Experience\n  \n\n4. Story\n  \n\n5. Relationships\n  \n\n6. Resources\n  \n\n7. Passions\n  \n\nWhat can you \"run a 5 minute mile\" in? What do you do really well?\n  \n\nWhat experiences have you had?\n  \n\nWhat is your story? What is your testimony?\n  \n\nWhat people have been put in your path?\n  \n\nWhat resources do you have? What do you do with your time?\n  \n\n-Everything is God's. Why would you waste any resources, even those that have been entrusted to others?\n  \n\nWhat do you care about?\n  \n\n-A group of 1500 were split into those who wanted to pursue \"money now\" (83%) vs those who wanted to pursue their passions (17%). After 20 years there were 100 millionaires. Only one was from the group who pursued \"money now\".\n  \n\n-You were created to fill gaps. If there is an area where you see something lacking, you should take care of it and be part of the solution.\n  \n\nIf you dislike what you don't have you may miss what you have.\n  \n\n\"Know yourself, love yourself, like yourself.\" -Stuart Smalley\n  \n\nKeep asking yourself, what does God want to do through me?\n  \n\nAnd we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.\n  \n\nRomans 8:28\n  \n\nMany things we ask God for things that will make us more worldly, we ask for things that we are told we shouldn't want.\n  \n\nMost of the people in the audience can have a home in the suburbs, high income, etc. If you set your sights on that goal it's not hard to come by. However, the desire for that is really lame.\n  \n\nThe servant in the parable was punished because he didn't do anything with what he was given.\n  \n\nIs God satisfied with your stewardship of the gifts he's given you?\n  \n\nSometimes the things you don't have are an asset.\n  \n\nTo whom much is given much is expected. Because we live in America we all have been given much.\n"},"url":{"en-US":"porch-notes-11222011"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/porch-notes-11222011/"}}},

UIP was created to get more Christians to register to vote. To accomplish this, they have to be able to identify: a) everyone who is not registered to vote, and b) which of those unregistered voters are Christians. The first part is fairly simple, since you can get voter registration lists, and deduce that anyone not on the list is not registered. It is the second part—identifying which people are Christians—that presents an interesting problem.  \n  \n  \n  \nUIP has tackled that problem through data mining. You cannot buy a mailing list of all Christians in the country, but you can get mailing lists for many other things—lists of people with kids, for instance, or people who have donated money to certain causes, or who subscribe to certain publications. The data miners looked for things that _might_ correlate with being a Christian—supporting a pro-life charity, for instance—and literally came up with a point system to determine who was a Christian. According to [the NPR story](http://www.npr.org/2012/02/27/147504999/to-get-out-the-vote-evangelicals-try-data-mining), you might get awarded points for home-schooling your kids, supporting traditional marriage, or if you enjoy fishing or NASCAR. (Seriously…NASCAR?) They then add up your points, and, “If [your score] totaled over 600 points, then we realized you were very serious about your faith.”  \n  \n  \n  \nThis brings up all sorts of interesting questions, such as: which NASCAR driver should I root for? If I am _really_ serious about my faith, should I be fly fishing or [noodling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noodling)?  \n  \n  \n  \nIt kind of makes me wonder how I would rate on their point system. The story does not go into any more detail about what items are worth points, or how many points each item is worth. But, it is not too difficult to come up with our own point system, based on things that are culturally associated with being a Christian. For example, here are the points you can add to your score if you…\n\n  \n- Went to a Bible college: +100\n  \n- Went to seminary: +250\n  \n- Went to Baylor: +20\n  \n- Went to A&M: +5\n  \n- Went to Texas: -5\n  \n- Carry a Bible with your name written on it or in it: +10  \n\n  \n  - And it [looks like this](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//ducttapebible.jpg): +15\n  \n  - Or have it as an iPhone app: +10\n  \n  - And have parts of it memorized: +10\n  \n  - Or written on your eye black during football games: +[Number 15](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow)\n  \n  \n  \n- Know how to correctly spell “Metaxas”: +15  \n\n  \n  - And “Lecrae”: +15\n  \n  - And “lama sabachthani”: +20\n  \n  - And can pronounce them correctly: +25\n  \n  \n  \n- Have Christian radio presets in your car: +5 (per station)  \n\n  \n  - And a Christian bumper sticker or fish logo: +10\n  \n  - And it’s a Suburban: +10\n  \n  - And has more than 200,000 miles: +15\n  \n  \n  \n- Wear a cross necklace: +5  \n\n  \n  - And you’re a dude: +5\n  \n  - Plus a “purity ring”: +10\n  \n  - And a WWJD bracelet: +the 90’s\n  \n  \n  \n- Are in a community group, small group, home group, discipleship group, or accountability group: +50\n  \n- Attend church most Sundays: +25  \n\n  \n  - And during the week: +50\n  \n  - Because you work there: +150\n  \n  - And are the one preaching from the pulpit: +250\n  \n  \n  \n- Have ever been on a mission trip:  \n\n  \n  - To Central America or the Caribbean: +25\n  \n  - To South America: +40\n  \n  - To Africa or Asia: +60\n  \n  - And stayed there: +175\n  \n  - And are considered a saint there: +500\n  \n  - Because you were martyred: +10,000\n  \n  \n  \n- Have ever played [this game](http://blog.theporchdallas.com/wp-content/uploads//MissionaryConquest.jpg): +30\n  \n- Are currently reading a Christian blog instead of working: +100\n  \n  \nAnd so on.

And no outward appearance or action truly makes you a Christian, any more than dressing up on Halloween makes you Dracula or Satan. But, Christians would hopefully live out their lives in a way that would make them stand out, and make it clear that they are not playing by the world’s rules. But that doesn’t mean wearing a bracelet or sticking an [Ichthys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthys) on your stock car. The Bible actually states quite clearly, and quite simply, how people should be able to identify a Christian. In John 13:34-35, Jesus Himself spells it out:  \n  \n  \n  \n“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you love one another.”  \n  \n  \n  \nOuch.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhy do I get the feeling that we are somehow missing this? Is this how non-believers look at Christians when they are deciding not to believe? Do people say, “Well, I would consider this Jesus fellow, but I just can’t stand the way that His followers are so dang loving?”  \n  \n  \n  \nYes, love does sometimes mean speaking truth, which can cause problems with people who do not love the truth. But the Bible also talks about “speaking the truth in love” (Ephesians 4:15). Which means there is more than one way to speak the truth; we are to do so “in love”.  \n  \n  \n  \nHey, I am just as prone to focus on appearances as anybody. But appearances, like a Halloween costume, can be a lie. It is our actions that truly define us; let those actions be defined by love.  \n  \n  \n  \n- Kevin"},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-identify-a-christian"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-identify-a-christian/"}}},

I caught myself looking for the source of the problem, and it was clear that there was a leadership void on the island nation. Without leadership, people ended up doing whatever they wanted in the moment. The Haitians pursued immediate gratification, which led to a domino effect of problems. They cut down trees to make charcoal that they sold for pennies. This left the beautiful hills completely barren and dusty. Rain then eroded the uncovered soil, leaving it unsuitable for farming; and the muddy runoff flooded the ocean, killing the reefs and running off the fish. So, the people of Haiti were left hungry and without commerce, all because no one considered the consequences of their actions.  \n  \n  \n  \nI was reminded of Haiti’s problems when the above verse, Hebrews 12:16, [came up recently](http://www.watermark.org/media/sex-the-problem-of-pleasure/1957/) during our (un)RESTRICTED series on sex. The mention of Esau selling his inheritance rights refers to an event recorded in [Genesis 25:19-34](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+25%3A19-34&version=NIV1984). It is the kind of story that sounds both crazy and completely believable, because it is exactly the type of unwise, hasty decision that people make every day—both here and in Haiti.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn the Genesis 25 story, Esau and Jacob are twin brothers. Esau is the oldest son—by about a minute—which in that culture meant he would receive the vast majority of their father Isaac’s property when Isaac passed away. Esau was also very much a “[rough and tumble](http://www.watermark.org/media/same-sex-bonding/1980/)” guy, while Jacob was the sensitive type and pretty much a mama’s boy.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnyway, Esau comes back from a hunting trip one day to find Jacob cooking some stew. He claims he is “starving to death,” and demands that Jacob give him some food. Jacob says he will give him the stew in exchange for Esau’s birthright—his first-born inheritance. Esau agrees to the trade, wanting to satisfy his immediate want and forsaking what it would really cost him.  \n  \n  \n  \nI don’t doubt that Esau was extremely hungry, and it’s true that he did not have the option of running down to the local Taco Bell; he would have had to cook something up from scratch, which takes time. But, basically, he cared more about satisfying his immediate appetite than the much larger benefit he could get down the road by not selling his inheritance. His father’s kingdom in exchange for ramen noodles—that was the trade. The Bible says that he “despised his birthright,” which is very strong wording, but gets the point across: he valued an immediate meal more than all the good things his father had for him. To Esau the future payoff was not worth holding out for.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, what does this story have to do with us today? A whole lot, actually.  \n  \n  \n  \nEach of us constantly faces decisions between what feels good now (our appetite), and what will feel good later. Eat unhealthy now, or have a healthy body later. Give in to pre-marital sexual urges now, or go into marriage free from the consequences (guilt, relationship baggage, STDs, children, abortions, sexual dysfunction, etc.) later. Chase after short-term material possessions now, or store up eternal treasures in heaven for later.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn every case, the long-term “later” benefits far outweigh the short-term “now” pleasure. Yet, far too often, we make the same laughable choice that Esau did: ramen noodles in exchange for the Father’s blessings.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe problem is that the here and now feels so much more immediate and concrete than some vague future—until the future becomes the here and now, and all we can do is regret. Right now, it feels like we are “starving to death.” Of course, we are not; no one has ever died from not having sex, or not owning an iPad, or from not eating junk. Urges eventually pass, whether they are satisfied or not.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat vague future inheritance, on the other hand, is so much greater than we can imagine. The Bible says ([in Romans 8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%208&version=NIV1984)) that when we believe, when we follow Him, we become children of God—and it emphasizes that as children, we are also heirs. Not heirs to whatever our earthly parents might leave us in their wills, but heirs to the one true King of the universe. We are heirs to the throne, and heirs to the One who owns all riches, all good pleasures, and all of time.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd you want to trade that for a cup of ramen noodles?  \n  \n  \n  \nJP"},"url":{"en-US":"choosing-ramen"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/choosing-ramen/"}}},

It seems to be a trend among Christian young adults, and I’m not even talking about dating or marriage. It is a lack of commitment to church. Call it [church-hopping](http://www.jonacuff.com/stuffchristianslike/2009/03/504-church-hopping/), church-shopping, or do-it-yourself Christianity. But the fact is that many believers, and even many who “go to” a church, choose not to “belong to” a church.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo is this a problem? The Bible doesn’t say that “Thou shalt be officially a member of thine local holy church.” And if you really wanted, you could probably make an argument that church membership has occasionally been a bad thing for at least a few people—if they believe that having your name on a church roll is what makes you a Christian, and somehow then miss what it means to believe and live out the gospel. Half of the New Testament is letters to people identified by the body they were associated with. Paul writes to the church at Corinth, the church at Ephesus, the church at Galatia, and others to rebuke, correct, train, praise, and encourage them.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Bible is very clear about the need for us to live in community. We are pack animals, and are not much good alone. (Why else would “solitary confinement” be considered the harshest punishment short of death?) And just because you have people physically around you does not mean that you are not alone. You are alone unless you _belong_ to something, and are engaged in some sort of interpersonal relationship. You can belong to groups other than a church, but they probably won’t fulfill the functions of a church.  \n  \n  \n  \nAh, so what are the functions of a church?  \n  \n\n\n  \n1. To encourage and challenge each other to be more like Christ ([Hebrews 10:24-25](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews%2010:24-25&version=NIV1984)). Basically, believers sharpen other believers and help each other grow ([Proverbs 27:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%2027:17&version=NIV1984)).\n  \n2. To help us more effectively use our gifts for God ([1 Corinthians 12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2012&version=NIV1984)). We each have different gifts, and cannot do everything on our own. Just like an accountant is pretty worthless without some organization to account for, and a CEO cannot be a leader without people to lead, the people of Christ are designed to function as part of a group.\n  \n3. To correct us in our mistakes ([Matthew 18:15-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018:15-20&version=NIV1984)). Correction or accountability might not sound like an attractive reason to join a church; however, it is biblical. [Hebrews 13:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews%2013:17&version=NIV1984) says that we are to submit to our church authority. Otherwise, it can be tempting to find an authority that I agree with in the moment, rather than to trust the Holy Spirit’s work through the authority over me and commit to them.\n  \n4. To care for us and allow us to care for others ([John 13:34-35](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2013:34-35&version=NIV1984)). It is through this kind of love that we can be a light for others.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nCan you be a member of a church and not get these benefits? If that is your experience, then you need to make a change: either change your level of involvement within the church, or, if you are already involved, change your church. Not _change churches_, but literally _change your church_. Be an agent of change within that body, because your church is not being a church. It is not fulfilling its function.  \n  \n  \n  \nCan you get these benefits without being a member of a church? If you are a part of a group that is fully doing these things, then you could possibly say that group _is_ a church. The first churches, after all, were groups of believers who lived in close community and met regularly in their own homes or in public spaces ([Acts 2:42-47](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%202:42-47&version=NIV1984)). But the real question is not whether that _can_ happen, but whether it _is_ happening. If it is not, then you need to find that somewhere. And you can find it by becoming a member of an active, Bible-based church.  \n  \n  \n  \nMembership is not the end-all, be-all for the believer. It is actually more like the beginning for the growing Christian. If you are a follower of Christ, join a local body—serve there, contribute there, be under authority there, be known there, and follow Christ there. A heart rebellious against this is a rebellious heart.  \n  \n  \n  \nJP"},"url":{"en-US":"why-church-membership-is-important"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-church-membership-is-important/"}}},

And though it is clearly an honest, straightforward question, there is another question hiding behind it: is porn really a big deal?  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is a big deal to God, and there are several reasons why it should be a big deal to you. In [Matthew 5:28](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A28&version=NIV1984), Jesus states that looking at someone lustfully is considered adultery. Looking and lusting is pretty much what defines pornography, so according to the scriptures porn use is adultery. So, you could rephrase the question as: should I date someone who is currently having sex with multiple other partners? The answer to that question is probably a bit more clear.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut why does Jesus take such a stance on the issue? Remember that when God tells us to do or not do something, He is not being a killjoy; He wants us to have joy. God is opposed to it because He wants what is best for us, and knows the problems that pornography causes.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe act of sex, or more specifically the act of orgasm, is a powerful force. Scientists have found that an orgasm releases chemicals that work to rewire our brains and bond us to our surroundings. This is by God’s design; see [Genesis 2:24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%202:24&version=NIV1984). With pornography, though, your brain is not bonding to your spouse; it is bonding to a variety of fake, 2D images. It is bonding to pornography itself, which is a big reason why the problem is so addicting. It gives your brain the chemical highs of drug use, without the expense and legal risks.  \n  \n  \n  \nAll of this makes pornography a very powerful teacher. It is like Sesame Street on crack: the use of visual images and repetition that worked so well in teaching us our ABCs is combined with a chemical high that rewires our brains. And what does pornography teach us? Three things:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. People are objects that exist for your pleasure.**  \n  \n  \n  \nPornography opens up the \"Pandora’s box\" of our sexual imagination. A porn addiction makes it more and more difficult to take our thoughts captive. When on an elevator alone with someone of the opposite sex, a porn addict might find themselves wondering intimately about the person sharing that space. Porn does not teach restraint and selflessness. In fact, it trains the opposite: take what you want, when you want, from whoever you want, as often as you want.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. One sexual partner is not enough.**  \n  \n  \n  \nI've never met the porn addict that returns to the same image exclusively. That is the great evil and genius of porn. It offers its partner a variety of sexual pleasures. It teaches you that God's design of one partner is vanilla and bland, and that you need more: not just variety, but never-ending variety. It is a slippery slope that trains you to be an adulterer of the worst kind.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. The natural human body is not good enough.**  \n  \n  \n  \nPorn is the breeding ground of a new kind of person. It takes well-endowed (and artificially-endowed) men and women and multiplies their kind on the screen. The acts are often not natural and the people rarely are. Porn consumers are quickly bored with the natural body, and with natural people. Porn is responsible for also multiplying insecurity in the bedroom. For example, a woman might feel like she cannot compete with the women on the computer screen and therefore is less willing to display her body.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou will someday be what you are now becoming. We are people in training. We are training ourselves by consuming God's word and preparing ourselves for future battles; or, we are training by poisoning our minds and hearts with images that we cannot digest appropriately. Men, even single men, are becoming better husbands and fathers. Women, even single women, are becoming better wives and mothers. Or, we, even single people, are becoming adulterers, learning from the school of pornography how to have a failed marriage, a low self-worth, and a distant relationship with our Maker.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy name is Jonathan Pokluda. I am a pastor and a healing porn addict. My prayer for you reading this is that you would confess your struggles to someone who loves you and loves God even more. I pray that as you seek to heal from your addiction that you would find a superior joy in Christ that is worth fighting for.  \n  \n  \n  \nJP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"should-i-date-someone-who-is-addicted-to-porn"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/should-i-date-someone-who-is-addicted-to-porn/"}}},

Though it does present a good sentiment about our actions being Christ-like, many of today’s evangelical preachers have had a field day with the quote, shouting that “you have to use words!”  \n  \n  \n  \nI agree. So does Paul, in Romans 10:14:  \n  \n  \n  \n_How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?_  \n  \n  \n  \nIn fact, if St. Francis were here today, I think that _he_ would agree that words are necessary. There are a couple of things to note about St. Francis that could help explain what he meant.  \n  \n  \n  \n**First off, St. Francis himself used words a lot.** He was a friar, but it’s not like he had taken a vow of silence; he gained his following as a traveling street preacher. He was even in the middle of giving a sermon when he died, which means that he literally spent his last breath preaching.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou see, Francis really did “preach the gospel at all times,” which is the part of the quote that people are more likely to overlook. We should be sharing the gospel everywhere we go. There is a quote that I think about when it comes to sharing my faith: 99% is a b\\*tch, 100% is a breeze. Let me put that in more sanctified terms: doing something all of the time is much simpler than trying to do it part of the time. For example, let’s say I make a commitment to cut down on the number of Cokes I drink. That means I can still drink Coke part of the time, which leaves me constantly facing a decision: is now one of the times I drink a Coke, or not? However, if I say I am going to stop drinking Cokes altogether, then it becomes much simpler. There is no dilemma about whether or not I have a Coke today; the answer to that question is always “no.”  \n  \n  \n  \nSimilarly, if we say we are going to share our faith more, there is always a decision. Should I share my faith with this co-worker, with this barista, with this neighbor? We are always trying to hear some prompting from the Holy Spirit, as if God might be jumping up and down in the corner, waving His arms and shouting, “NO, DON’T TELL _THIS GUY_ ABOUT ME!”  \n  \n  \n  \nMy point is this: if you commit to sharing your faith wherever you go, with whomever you talk to, then there is no decision to be made. It also gets easier, and you will get better at it with practice.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The other thing to remember about St. Francis is that everyone would have known he was a follower of Jesus, whether he said anything or not.** In every rendition I have ever seen of him, he is wearing a friar’s habit. So, his actions or good works would have clearly been seen as the works of a Christ-follower. You can imagine how your actions might preach if you were wearing a shirt that says “I follow Jesus.” Suddenly, everything you did would make a difference in what people thought about Christianity: how you speak, how you tip, how you work hard, how you treat others, and how you care for the needy in your path would all be seen as sermons without words.  \n  \n  \n  \nAre we hiding behind the fact that people don’t know we follow Jesus? For some of us, sadly, it is probably better that most people don’t know. If others observed your life, would they label you a Jesus-follower? Moreover, would that label be a positive reflection of how you loved them, or would it be a label of bigotry, laziness, or hypocrisy?  \n  \n  \n  \n_So, in sharing my faith should I rely on my works or my words?_ The answer would be “both.” “Both,” and “it depends.” It depends on the relationship. For short-term interactions with people who don’t know us—a server, or barista, or anyone we may meet just once—we need to lean more on words. For others, like our neighbors, they should see it in our deeds; but even then, we have to use words to explain the reason behind our actions, as the Bible says in [1 Peter 3:15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A15&version=NIV1984).  \n  \n  \n  \nPreach the gospel without words. And with words. Or with sign language, or iPhone apps, or cave drawings, or interpretive dance. Share the gospel using whatever is necessary. But share the gospel.  \n  \n  \n  \nJP"},"url":{"en-US":"evangelism-works-vs-words"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/evangelism-works-vs-words/"}}},

In the spirit of full disclosure, she listed all the good and not-so-good traits of the animal, including a tendency to nip at people’s heels and a big problem with chasing cars.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen you own a Blue Heeler, especially in an urban setting, those are the things you come to expect. Blue Heelers are cattle dogs, selectively bred for their herding abilities. In fact, their official breed name is “[Australian Cattle Dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cattle_Dog);” they are called either “Blue Heelers” or “Red Heelers” based on their color and their tendency to nip at cattle’s heels.  \n  \n  \n  \nI grew up on a ranch myself, and my nearby grandparents had a Blue Heeler. It was a stray, dumped by the “city folk” who would regularly drive out into the country to abandon unwanted pets. Take pity on one of these abandoned dogs by feeding it, and you instantly had a loyal new pet—whether you really wanted one or not. We called this particular stray “Dog,” simply because nobody bothered to come up with a name for it.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou might think that a cattle dog would be a welcomed help on a working cattle ranch. However, unlike some of our border-collie-toting neighbors, we never bothered to train our dogs to work. Our dogs were simply pets; their main job was simply to be petted, act happy to see us, and not drag too many dead things into the yard.  \n  \n  \n  \nDog, the Blue Heeler, seemed pretty happy with this arrangement, and we were happy enough with him—except for the car chasing. He would chase every single car that came down my grandparents' long, dusty driveway; chase them both coming and going. It wasn’t like he was attacking anyone or trying to guard the house; he just really liked chasing. My grandmother eventually got a remote-controlled shock collar to train him not to do so.  \n  \n  \n  \nShock a Blue Heeler a few times, and eventually they will learn not to chase cars. But they won’t stop _wanting_ to chase cars; they are just afraid of the shock. They won’t be happy about it, because chasing things is part of their nature. It’s in their DNA.  \n  \n  \n  \nNow, with the effort spent training them not to chase cars, you could instead teach a Blue Heeler how to herd cattle. Herding cattle is basically just controlled chasing: chasing the right things in the right direction at the right time. Cattle dogs are at their happiest when herding cattle; it fits their instincts better than chasing cars, and actually accomplishes something productive. Plus, after a long day herding cattle, the dogs are much less likely to chase a car, even if you’ve never done anything to train them about cars or even scolded them for doing so. They might still mess up (chase cars) occasionally, but they will also be fulfilling their purpose—as opposed to the dog who is only trained to not chase cars, and who never accomplishes anything.  \n  \n  \n  \nOK, so here is the point of all this dog-training stuff: we humans are just like Blue Heelers. We each have a natural tendency to do certain things, and we do not feel happy or fulfilled unless we are doing them. Just like dogs, though, we often try to fulfill those longings by chasing entirely the wrong things.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor example, many guys have a longing to rescue the princess: to honor and protect and sacrifice self for beauty, and to have that beauty love and honor them in return. But many or most find themselves chasing after a mere fantasy of that, which is so much easier to obtain but totally void of fulfillment. Or you may long to battle the forces of evil, to restore what is broken and push back the darkness with light—but instead battle for market share, or find this weird significance in winning against “evil” sports teams from other cities.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe’re chasing the wrong things, and our hearts know it deep down. We try to stop doing what we know is wrong, disciplining ourselves in the art of self-denial—and fail, or are at best left miserable, because we are fighting against what we were made for. We need not restraint, but redirection. The best way to stop chasing cars is to chase after the work of God instead.  \n  \n  \n  \n_For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. – Ephesians 2:10_  \n  \n  \n  \n_Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of our heart. – Psalm 37:4_  \n  \n  \n  \nThe desires of your heart are good things, and are meant to be fulfilled. But let’s be honest: our own way of doing things has not been very fulfilling, and our self-help obedience schools have mostly taught us regret. It’s time to let God teach us some new tricks.  \n  \n  \n  \n_- [Kevin McConaghy](https://plus.google.com/108225385241400201197?rel=author)_\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"chasing-cars"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/chasing-cars/"}}},

For some, it is a very emotional experience; for much of my life, unfortunately, I’ve seen it as a ritual. I went to church every Sunday, and sang along every Sunday, but put very little thought into the words I was singing.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy mistake, as there are some very good words there. Words that can remind us of who God is and who we are; that can stir our affections for Him and help us better express gratitude for what He has done. If people simply read and mindlessly sing along, we can express some really great truths without actually hearing or understanding them ourselves.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, particularly after [this past Tuesday’s message](http://www.watermark.org/media/for-the-love-of-god/2136/), I wanted to look a bit closer at one of the songs sung at The Porch: “[How He Loves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCunuL58odQ).” The song, written by John Mark McMillan and made most famous by David Crowder Band, is one of those that seems to really break through to people and impact their hearts. It does so, I think, not because it is beautiful poetry, but because it actually has a lot of truth from Scripture packed into the lyrics.  \n  \n  \n  \nWithout further ado, an analysis (or even over-analysis) of “How He Loves,” with lyrics written in bold:  \n  \n  \n  \n**He is jealous for me**  \n  \n  \n  \nThe reason why I started looking closer at the lyrics to this song is because a friend took issue with it describing God as being jealous. However, this opening line actually has some of the most support in Scripture. The Bible repeatedly describes God as a “jealous God.” But it is a specific kind of jealously. The song is “How He Loves”; it is all about how God loves us. And each time the Bible talks about God being “jealous,” it is in reference to people choosing to love some other “god” more than Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Do not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God. – Exodus 34:14_  \n  \n  \n  \nWhatever we love the most becomes our “god,” whether that is money, comfort, prestige, or any other idol. None of those things are worthy of being number one in our lives, and none of them can bring us any lasting happiness. Being jealous about your affections for something other than God is considered “godly jealousy”:  \n  \n  \n  \n_I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. – 2 Corinthians 11:2-3_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree**  \n  \n  \n  \nThis uses poetic imagery to get across how strong God’s love is: like the power of a hurricane bending a tree. It makes sense for the songwriter to compare God’s love to a storm, because the Bible often uses the power of storms to remind us of the power of God:  \n  \n  \n  \n_When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses. – Jeremiah 51:16_  \n  \n  \n  \nBesides that, though, John Mark McMillan wrote the song soon after a storm in his own life, with his best friend dying in a car wreck. That God is still loving even when circumstances seem to suggest otherwise is perhaps the main theme of the song.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy**  \n  \n  \n  \n“Mercy” is defined as: “Compassion or forgiveness shown toward someone whom it is within one’s power to punish or harm.” Basically, if you fully deserve to be punished, and the judge instead lets you go free, the judge has shown you mercy. The greater the punishment you have been excused from, the more mercy you have been given.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat is what God does. All of us have sinned ([Romans 3:23](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%203:23&version=NIV1984)), and the punishment for sin is death—eternal death.  \n  \n  \n  \n_For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. – Romans 6:23_  \n  \n  \n  \nInstead of what we deserve, God shows great mercy by freely offering us eternal life instead. The reason for describing this mercy so powerfully is because it is the greatest mercy possible: offering eternal paradise instead of eternal punishment, and offering it to everyone, no matter what they might have done.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners —of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life. – 1 Timothy 1:15-16_  \n  \n  \n  \n**When all of a sudden**  \n**I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory**  \n  \n  \n  \n_I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. – Romans 8:18_  \n  \n  \n  \n**And I realize just how beautiful You are  \nAnd how great Your affections are for me**    \n  \n  \n  \n_God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. – Philippians 1:8_  \n  \n  \n  \nThe whole song is about God’s affections or love for us, as is emphasized repeatedly:  \n  \n  \n  \n**And oh, how He loves us, oh  \nOh, how He loves us  \nHow He loves us all**    \n  \n  \n  \n_You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. – Romans 5:6-8_  \n  \n  \n  \n**We are His portion**   \n  \n  \n  \n_For the LORD’s portion is His people, Jacob his allotted inheritance. – Deuteronomy 32:9_  \n  \n  \n  \nGod’s “portion” is the part of something that is set apart for Him. When used in reference to people, it means God’s people. The people of Jacob (Israel) were originally His portion, until Jesus adopted ([Ephesians 1:5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A5&version=NIV1984)) all believers into the family.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe “Lord’s portion” was also often used to refer to things set aside as sacrifices to Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship. – Romans 12:1_  \n  \n  \n  \n**and He is our prize**   \n  \n  \n  \n_Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize. – 1 Corinthians 9:24-27_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes**  \n  \n  \n  \n“Redemption” means that we have been bought back; God paid the price of His Son’s life to bring us back to Him. And whereas “mercy” means that we are spared the punishment that we really deserve, “grace” means that we are given a gift that we really don’t deserve.  \n  \n  \n  \n_For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. – Romans 3:23-25a_  \n  \n  \n  \n**If His grace is an ocean, we're all sinking**  \n  \n  \n  \n_And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. – Ephesians 3:17b-19_  \n  \n  \n  \n**And Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss**  \n  \n  \n  \nSo what’s with this “Heaven meets earth” stuff and talk about kissing? That seems to be the least-understood and most controversial line in the whole song, to the point where David Crowder even changed the words. (The original version spoke of a “sloppy wet kiss”; [the songwriter explains the change and the meaning behind those words](http://johnmarkmcmillan.blogspot.com/2009/09/how-he-loves-david-crowder-and-sloppy.html) on his blog.)  \n  \n  \n  \nEven McMillan’s explanation of the “Heaven meets earth” part seems a bit vague. But, in the context of the song talking about God’s love, which is most fully expressed by Jesus’ life and death on the cross, I can’t imagine it referring to anything other than Jesus. God Himself descending from Heaven and becoming an earthly mortal, showing what God is like and demonstrating His love by dying for us—that is the fullest expression of Heaven meeting earth.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:  \nWho, being in very nature God,  \ndid not consider equality with God something to be grasped,  \nbut made himself nothing,  \ntaking the very nature of a servant,  \nbeing made in human likeness.  \nAnd being found in appearance as a man,  \nhe humbled himself  \nand became obedient to death —  \neven death on a cross! – Philippians 2:5-8_    \n  \n  \n  \n**And my heart turns violently inside of my chest**  \n  \n  \n  \nWhy do certain stories or songs (like this one) tug at our hearts, in a way that we really can’t understand? Because they reflect God’s eternal story of His love for us, which we are hard-wired to respond to.  \n  \n  \n  \n_He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end. – Ecclesiastes 3:11_  \n  \n  \n  \n**I don't have time to maintain these regrets**  \n  \n  \n  \nWe are not meant to dwell on mistakes or failures. God took on Himself the punishment for our sins; we are not asked to punish ourselves. “He loves us” completely; He doesn’t love us more or less based on our performance.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. – 2 Corinthians 7:10_  \n  \n  \n  \n**When I think about the way**  \n  \n  \n  \nOK, let’s think about it. This should help drive the truth home:  \n  \n  \n  \n**Oh, how He loves us, oh**  \n  \n  \n  \n_But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions —it is by grace you have been saved. – Ephesians 2:4-5_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Oh, how He loves us**  \n  \n  \n  \n_For great is your love, reaching to the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies. – Psalm 57:10_  \n  \n  \n  \n**How He loves us so**  \n  \n  \n  \n_For great is your love toward me; you have delivered me from the depths of the grave. – Psalm 86:13_  \n  \n  \n  \n**How He loves**  \n  \n  \n  \n_I will sing of the LORD’s great love forever; with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations. – Psalm 89:1_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Yeah He loves us**  \n  \n  \n  \n_For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him. – Psalm 103:11_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Oh, how He loves us**  \n  \n  \n  \n_Whoever is wise, let him heed these things and consider the great love of the LORD. – Psalm 107:43_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Oh, how He loves us**  \n  \n  \n  \n_For great is his love toward us, and the faithfulness of the LORD endures forever. Praise the LORD. – Psalm 117:2_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Oh, how He loves**  \n  \n  \n  \n_Because of the LORD’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. – Lamentations 3:22_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Oh, what love**  \n  \n  \n  \n_Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. – John 15:13_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Yeah He loves us**  \n  \n  \n  \n_The LORD your God is with you, he is mighty to save. He will take great delight in you, he will quiet you with his love, he will rejoice over you with singing. – Zephaniah 3:17_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Yeah He loves us**  \n  \n  \n  \n_How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! – 1 John 3:1_  \n  \n  \n  \n**How He loves us**  \n  \n  \n  \n_For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. – John 3:16_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Oh, how He loves us so**  \n  \n  \n  \n_[Kevin McConaghy](https://plus.google.com/108225385241400201197?rel=author) is a freelance copywriter and serves as editor of The Porch blog.

This was on the tail end of several busy weeks, and I was tired and susceptible to the enemy’s enticing.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs I walked through the airport, a number of things got me thinking about my job, and my calling, and wondering about whether I was really on the right path. First, I saw a family who was leaving for vacation: a dad in his Hawaiian-themed shirt, a mom in her sundress, and their two children dressed in excitement, joy, and beachwear. I suddenly missed my family and strongly wished that I was with them leaving for a vacation. I tried to remember our last vacation and though it was not long ago, it felt like an old fading memory. I felt deserving of relaxation and hated the weight of responsibility on me.  \n  \n  \n  \nThen, I saw a businessman with a nice custom suit, clean haircut, and expensive watch. I thought about the deals he was traveling to make as he talked on his cell phone, carefully navigating a conversation. I envied his calling as a businessman, imagining the ease with which he would retire one day, with more wealth than he needed and plenty to leave his children. I thought back to my days in sales. All of a sudden, I thought about the money it would require to send our kids to college. I wondered how we would have enough. I questioned what I would do next, as suddenly, for the first time in a long time, my job did not seem adequate.  \n  \n  \n  \nI was traveling with two other friends, and when we landed we had some time to get out and see D.C. The day was spent looking at large, expensive, marble and granite structures that stood to memorialize the dead. The day concluded with a walk through Arlington National Cemetery, which has hundreds of thousands of smaller marble “monuments” standing to memorialize men and women who had fought for our freedom and died. (On a side note: I am extremely grateful for all of these men and women and their efforts for our freedom, and I am also very grateful for the forefathers of our country who defined the freedom that we enjoy.) What stood out to me in Washington, D.C. was that it was a giant monument to the past, and specifically to those who are no longer with us.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt also struck me that many of the structures reminded me of Greek ruins, such as the Parthenon, or the Temple of Artemis in [Ephesus](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/257/). The greatest structures in D.C. had massive columns of marble, just like the ones we see in remaining ruins. And in a moment I realized that they, too, would all be toppled one day. The [Temple of Artemis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis) was considered the greatest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and was about four times as large as the similarly-designed Lincoln Memorial. Yet all that remains of that “wonder” today is a few scattered stones; the building is so completely destroyed that it took modern scholars 60 years just to find it. So, not only will great men no longer be around one day, but nothing that reminds us of them will remain.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd then there was little old me. Irrelevant, except that Christ lives in me. I spend so much time thinking about my “calling”; trying to figure out where my gifts and talents meet the greatest needs of the world, as if I am personally the answer to the problem. I spend so much time making sure that I am maximizing my so-called output, and wondering if I am doing exactly the right thing. I spend so much time thinking about me. But when Jesus “calls” a follower, He asks them to come and die ([Mark 8:35](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+8%3A35&version=NIV1984)). He seems to say, “Become less, so that I might become greater through you” ([John 3:30](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%203:30&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \n  \n  \nIn modern Christianity, we spend so much time focusing on ourselves that we never seem to yield to the power and might of God. We just take our measly natural powers and try to develop them so that we never see the supernatural work. And yet the best we can do on our own—even by the greatest human, with the biggest monuments—are fairly close to meaningless in the long run of eternity.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut everything that I can’t do, God _can_ do. When you come to the end of yourself and can do no more, God moves. The greatest thing you do today is surrender fully to Him who can do immeasurably more than we can ask, or even imagine ([Ephesians 3:20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%203:20&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \n  \n  \nHere’s the ironic part: though the earthly monuments that we build to “immortalize” people (or that people build in an attempt to “immortalize” themselves) will eventually turn to dust, the people themselves actually _are_ immortal. After this short time on earth, each of us will be spending eternity somewhere. God has allowed us to aid in His creation of immortal monuments—not simple and unimaginative stone columns, but wonderfully unique, creative, and living people. He has allowed us to steward His eternal truths and invest in the lives of others who will be able to worship Him forever.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat is your calling. The highest and best use of our lives is surrendering to the One who can do all things.  \n  \n  \n  \nJP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"what-is-my-calling"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-is-my-calling/"}}},

For the curious, it was this sentence:  \n  \n  \n  \n_“…Christ’s foremost commandment is to love Him and others (Matthew 22:36-40)...joy, peace, and kindness are much more important to God than adhering to strict rules (for which Jesus rebuked the Pharisees).”_  \n  \n  \n  \nHere’s the thing: I already knew that. It had struck me as important before; I had read about it, journaled on it, sought to put it into practice. And not just once; this revelation had served as revelation to me a few different times over the years. And yet here I was again, underlining it and thinking, “I need to remember that.”  \n  \n  \n  \n“Forgetful me”, I wrote in the margin at the bottom of the page.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow easily I forget things—not forever, but at least in the moment.  \n  \n  \n  \n[This Tuesday’s message on Ephesians 4:17-32](http://www.watermark.org/media/changed-by-truth/2151/) dealt with how our lives and actions are changed by the truth. Our behavior always follows our beliefs; if you don’t like your behavior, examine what you are believing in those moments and remind yourself of the truth.  \n  \n  \n  \nI, for one, need reminding. Daily. That is the idea behind this list: important truths from Scripture that can be read daily and kept fresh in the mind. This list could be longer (or shorter), so I’d love to hear (in the comments) if you have any truths from Scripture particularly worth remembering.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Remember that:**  \n  \n  \n  \n**You are fully loved.**  \n_How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! – 1 John 3:1_  \n_Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. – John 15:13_  \n  \n  \n  \n**You are fully forgiven.**  \n_But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation. – Colossians 1:22_  \n  \n  \n  \n**God made you for a purpose.**  \n_For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. – Ephesians 2:10_  \n  \n  \n  \n**He did not make a mistake when He made you.**  \n_For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. – Psalm 139:13-14_  \n  \n  \n  \n**You cannot earn salvation, no matter what you do.**  \n_For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith —and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast. – Ephesians 2:8-9_  \n_...all our righteous acts are like filthy rags... – Isaiah 64:6_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Thankfully we don’t have to, because it is a free gift.**  \n_For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. – Romans 3:23-24_  \n_For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. – Romans 6:23_  \n  \n  \n  \n**God is not trying to rip you off…**  \n_He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? – Romans 8:32_  \n_Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart. – Psalm 37:4_  \n  \n  \n  \n**…but Satan is, through his lies.**  \n_He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. – John 8:44_  \n_The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. – John 10:10_  \n  \n  \n  \n**God is in control, and works everything out for good…**  \n_And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. – Romans 8:28_  \n  \n  \n  \n**…even though we might find it hard to see the good in the short run.**  \n_He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end. – Ecclesiastes 3:11_  \n_You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. – Genesis 50:20_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Everything earthly is temporary…**  \n_For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. – 2 Corinthians 4:17-18_  \n_Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. – Revelation 21:1_  \n  \n  \n  \n**…and any sacrifice here on earth is momentary.**  \n_I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. – Romans 8:18_  \n_And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. – Matthew 19:29_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Whatever you can’t do, God can do through you.**  \n_For it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose. – Philippians 2:13_  \n_If God is for us, who can be against us? – Romans 8:31b_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Your weaknesses are God’s greatest chance to shine.**  \n_But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. – 2 Corinthians 12:9-10_  \n  \n  \n  \n**So be made new…**  \n_You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. – Ephesians 4:22-24_  \n_Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! – 2 Corinthians 5:17_  \n  \n  \n  \n**…be selfless…**  \n_Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. – Philippians 2:3-4_  \n  \n  \n  \n**…trust God…**  \n_So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. – Matthew 6:31-33_  \n  \n  \n  \n**… pray with thanksgiving…**  \n_Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. – Philippians 4:6_  \n_Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. – 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18_  \n  \n  \n  \n**…and share this good news.**  \n_He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. – Mark 16:15_  \n_How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, “Your God reigns!” – Isaiah 52:7_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Everything in life boils down to loving God and loving people.**  \n_Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment.

In my job, I get to observe hundreds of dating relationships, some of which turn into God-honoring marriages. And in the search for those marriages, I also hear about the dating complaints of many young adults, both male and female.  \n  \n  \n  \nLet me start by stating that in your pursuit of a spouse, you are not bound by the rules of men, but rather should seek what wisdom God has for you in His Word. [Matthew 6:33](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A33&version=NIV1984) comes to mind, for example. You can also learn from the successes or failures of others, gathering wisdom principles learned by other Christians.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, based on Scripture and my own observations, I would like to address some of the common dating complaints I consistently hear. (You can hear more in [podcasts of our “Boy Meets Girl” series](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/222/).) Here, in part 1 of this multi-part blog, we’ll focus on the first part of the dating process: asking someone out, or the pursuit.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Guys don’t ask the girls out**  \n  \n  \n  \nYou hear this complaint quite a bit (from the girls, obviously). Though it is not entirely true as a blanket statement, I’m sure it is true that some guys don’t ask girls out, and that some girls don’t get asked.  \n  \n  \n  \nThere are several reasons, both good and bad, why some Christian guys may not ask girls out:  \n  \n\n\n  \n- They are not ready to date or marry. If that is the case, them choosing to not date for a time is actually the most loving thing they can do.\n  \n- They fear rejection. The potential fear of rejection is worse for them than the fear of feeling lonely.\n  \n- A really sad trend I see is that guys are fulfilling their need for companionship with two-dimensional images of women viewed over the internet. This not only stifles their desire to ask someone out and risk rejection, but it also perverts their standards for physical beauty—based on artificial images and bodies—and causes unrealistic expectations that can never be filled by someone real. If this hits a bit too close to home for you, please consider [Re:Generation](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery/).\n  \n  \nSadly, one other factor that contributes to this problem is that women outnumber men within the church. This is a problem everywhere; we’re not talking specifically about The Porch. But the gender gap is probably most pronounced among the single 20s and 30s demographic. Among those who are actively following Christ, the ratio of women to men is not 1:1; honestly, it is probably closer to 2:1. Basically, the male half of the species needs to step up in living out their faith. Ladies, be patient in waiting for him and be active in pursuing God.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Girls always say “no” to dates**  \n  \n  \n  \nAh, now this is interesting. If guys aren’t asking girls out, then how is it that girls are saying “no”? And if women are so starved for dates and have such a shortage of Christian men around, why are so many men feeling rejected?  \n  \n  \n  \nThere are faults on both sides of the aisle here. Some (not all) of the women complaining about guys not asking them out would be more honest in saying “_that specific_ guy” or “_that type of_ guy” is not asking them out. To them, I would say to A) stop complaining, and B) be careful not to inadvertently cause the fear of rejection that can prevent those guys from asking other, more willing girls out.  \n  \n  \n  \nMen, there may be several reasons why a woman turned you down:  \n  \n  \n\n  \n- She may not be ready to date or marry. Again, in such cases, you are better off if she does turn you down.\n  \n- She may not think that you are ready to date. Ladies, if that is the case, hopefully you will lovingly speak the truth and tell him that is the reason, instead of making up some lame excuse (which could also be referred to as “lying”.)\n  \n- She may not approve of your method. You “poking” (can you still do that?) someone on Facebook is not an acceptable invitation. For that matter, any invitation done over internet technology (social media, email, or texting) will not fly for asking out my daughters (in 30 years, when they are old enough to date). Find some courage and show up.\n  \n- She may not be attracted to you in “that way”…whatever that means. I know this one hurts, but it is going to be OK. She might have unrealistic expectations herself, or you might be looking out of your league…or maybe you just need a haircut and a borrowed shirt, I don’t know. Ladies, if you know him and know he loves The Lord, give him a chance…or at least a date.\n  \n  \nGirls are too aggressive  \n  \n  \n  \nGirls, we (guys) want a girl. Your affinity for football is cute; you asking us out and constantly calling is not. I hope this helps you and not hurts you, but though guys might date aggressive girls, they are not likely to marry one. Guys need to initiate; be faithful and respond to his invite. That might sound like a lot of waiting, but be patient. Don’t speed things up by compromising the way you dress to attract a guy…you may attract someone, but it will certainly be the wrong guy. Please read this slowly: you will lose him for the same reason you “won” him. If you catch him with fleeting bait ([Proverbs 31:30](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%2031:30&version=NIV1984)), you will get a fleeting relationship.  \n  \n  \n  \nGoing on dates with strangers  \n  \n  \n  \nYou shouldn’t take candy from them, and you shouldn’t spend extended time with them pursuing romance. I know, I know, you date to get to know someone, right? Not really…well, kind of. You date to see if someone you know is someone you want to spend the rest of your life with. So how well do you need to know them? Well, you need to know that they love God and are pursuing a relationship with Him. This narrows your search considerably to a small pool of people active in your church, or another healthy church. The reality is that if you are running in church circles, you probably know lots of people who would make awesome spouses. Serve faithfully and enjoy your singleness. Guys, when someone is serving faithfully with you and you become interested in her, ask her out. It’s just coffee! Ladies, if a stranger comes up to ask for your number it means that the girls who really know him are probably unwilling to go out with him…something to think about.  \n  \n  \n  \nJust because they are at church or The Porch, certainly does not guarantee they are someone you want to be stuck at a table for two with. Be wise.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, guys, ask out those girls around you. Don’t overlook the faithful person serving next to you. Girls, if he is faithful and a good guy, give him a chance.  \n  \n  \n  \nMore to come; continued in [part 2](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dating-101-lets-be-honest/).  \n  \n  \n  \nJP"},"url":{"en-US":"dating-101-the-ask"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/dating-101-the-ask/"}}},

Stalker. Besides, admit it: you're really just hoping you can [play basketball with him](http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-cowboys/headlines/20100511-Add-church-league-basketball-to-Tony-9310.ece).  \n  \n  \n  \n**Blue Heeler fear issues**  \nMaybe you were bitten by one as a child?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why are they called Heelers?**  \nBecause they tend to go for the animal's heels.

Sometimes.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What is wrong with Matt Chandler?**  \nHe has brain cancer, and has undergone chemotherapy. Pray for him.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd, apparently, he sometimes talks about porn.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Does it say in the Bible that God loves?**  \n[Yes, it does](http://theporchdallas.com/how-he-loves/).  \n  \n  \n  \n**Which NASCAR driver should I root for?**  \nRicky Bobby.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Destruction in rear view mirror**  \nI would recommend taking driver's ed.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How to say thank you to someone who is s**  \nWait, what? You stopped short with \"s\". Now I really want to know what that person is that begins with \"s\". Are they special to you? So important in your life? Spanish? Southern? Socially awkward? So far away?  \n  \n  \n  \nWithout more information, I can't be certain that I'm giving you the right answer. But, I'll venture a guess and suggest you say \"Gracias\".  \n  \n  \n  \n**Kanakuk Kamp denied**  \nOh, I'm very sorry to hear that. Perhaps you can try [Sky Ranch](http://www.skyranch.org/) instead?  \n  \n  \n  \n**1 Timothy 4:12 tattoo**  \nWait. Before you do anything permanent, let's think about this for a minute. 1 Timothy 4:12 is indeed a great Bible verse. It says:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity._  \n  \n  \n  \nNow, we can debate whether or not getting a tattoo sets a good example or not, or whether it would cause some older people to look down on you. But I am more interested in the \"young\" part. This verse is excellent for those who are young. But, like diamonds, tattoos are forever (or at least the earthly version of \"forever\"). Which means, for most of your life, the tattoo won't really apply to you personally. And as you age, your skin ages, so someday this encouragement to youngsters will be all wrinkled and old, and you will have accidentally become ironic.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, I think the answer is \"no\".  \n  \n  \n  \n**How to date someone addicted to porn**  \nI think the real question you should be asking yourself is not _how_, but rather \"[_should_ I date someone who is addicted to porn?](http://theporchdallas.com/should-i-date-someone-who-is-addicted-to-porn/)\"  \n  \n  \n  \n**Who is buying Porchas?**  \nI don't know.

If both parties would simply be honest, and intentional, we could avoid many of the dating complaints I hear. Here are some more of those complaints:  \n  \n  \n  \n**Girls “claiming” a guy, because they like him**  \n  \n  \n  \nLadies, he is not yours. You do not own him. If you have broken up, that means he is probably going to eventually look for someone else to date (and you should too, eventually). If you have not broken up _because you never dated_, then that quite clearly means that he does not belong to you. You have no right to control who he might date.  \n  \n  \n  \nI know it might hurt if he chooses someone else. Be honest about those feelings with the girls in your life, ask for prayer, and turn your focus elsewhere ([Matthew 6:33](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%206:33&version=NIV1984)). If his new someone is a friend of yours, I know that is really messy. But please remember, he was not yours because you “liked” him. Work to let go, and move on. Also, consider how your feelings got to this place. Ask the girls in your life to help you with not creating an unhealthy attachment to someone you are not in a relationship with.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Girls taking a couple of dates too seriously**  \n  \n  \n  \nSay it with me: “It’s just coffee.” His “Would you like to grab coffee sometime?” does not equate to “Will you be the mother of my children?”  \n  \n  \n  \nI could advise you to ask questions so that you know where you stand. However, better advice would be to only date guys who clearly let you know where you stand, so that you don’t have to ask. Guys, help me out here. Defining the relationship (a DTR) never hurt anyone.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Guys are not intentional**  \n  \n  \n  \nAgain, in case you missed it: a DTR never hurt anyone. Guys, do you want to understand women? OK. Lesson number one: they wonder a lot. They wonder about how you feel about them, wonder how to interpret what you said, and wonder what you meant by how you acted, what you wore, or why you ordered what you ordered at Starbucks. You can help them out by being honest and letting them know what you think about them. If you say you will call, call! Honesty might be difficult for boys, but for men it is a way of life.  \n  \n  \n  \nMen are honest with care. The “with care” part does not mean “less than the truth”, and the “honest” part does not mean, “punch to the gut”. Work to speak the truth in love ([Ephesians 4:15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%204:15&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \n  \n  \nI am asking you to be intentional, but not intense. “Intense” prophesies the next 15 years on date one. (Say it with me: “It’s just coffee.”) “Intentional” says: “I had a great time, and I’d love to see you again sometime soon. Can I call you next week?” Just be sincere ([Romans 12:9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2012:9&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \n  \n  \n**“Frates” or “friendationships”**  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is the new “friend zone”, where the guy asks a girl on a “friend date” (a “frate”) or carries on a close friendship with her. Girls, you are left wondering whether you are his buddy, or potentially his future bride. He gets the emotional connection with the opposite sex that he desires, and you get left with lots of questions. He plays with your heart, and your heart is left confused—or worse, hurting.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are wondering why he is texting you at 11 p.m. to tell you goodnight, when he has never even asked you out, text him back with something paraphrased from [1 Corinthians 14:20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2014:20&version=NIV1984): “Grow up!”  \n  \n  \n  \n**Leading people on**  \n  \n  \n  \nNot cool. If they are just a friend, say so; don’t go about building someone up for a more devastating fall. Be honest ([1 John 2:21](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:21&version=NIV1984)). We might cry for a minute and hate you for a few days, but we’ll get over it. Just because you don’t know what you want, does not give you the right to try and have everything. You are not a “player”; you are a [child](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2013:11&version=NIV1984).  \n  \n  \n  \nMen, if you are not ready to get married, then don’t pursue a relationship—much less anything physical. Ladies, if he wants to kiss you but not be committed to you, let him be someone else’s “prize”.  \n  \n  \n  \nDating does not have to be confusing or complicated; most people just make it that way. Don’t make it that way.  \n  \n  \n  \nTo be continued in [part 3](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dating-101-getting-serious/).  \n  \n  \n  \nJP\n\n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"2g2pfghoRCGi8Gs2eICwqq"}}},"url":{"en-US":"dating-101-lets-be-honest"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/dating-101-lets-be-honest/"}}},

Because self-control is specifically named as a fruit (or evidence) of The Spirit, while things like sexual immorality and impurity are listed as “obvious” acts of the sinful nature (see [Galatians 5:16-26](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:16-26&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \n  \n  \nWanting to have sex with someone of the opposite sex is a good thing; God wired you that way. Having sex with someone you are not married to, however, is a bad thing. The solution to these competing interests is self-control. But it is something that you learn long before the date. You learn self-control any time you want something that you shouldn’t have, whether it be a purse, a drink, or an image on the internet.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou will need self-control to have a healthy marriage. Getcha some.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Purity**  \n  \n  \n  \nAre you committed to purity? Are they? It requires a commitment from both parties.  \n  \n  \n  \nTo compromise purity is to invite problems into your relationship. I have never seen an exception to this rule. I have officiated many weddings, but I have never met the newlywed couple who regretted having boundaries when they dated, or who wished they had gone further physically before the wedding night. Many times, however, I have processed the problems that occurred in relationships and marriages from not having these boundaries when dating.  \n  \n  \n  \nRemember that God is not trying to rip you off, and His goal is not to spoil your fun. He calls you to purity because it is the best thing for you; the enemy tries to convince you otherwise because [he is seeking to destroy you](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&version=NIV1984). You know it is true. Don’t be destroyed.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Early emotional exchange**  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is the “me too, me too, me too” conversation that gets our hearts all twisted up the first time we talk for 17 hours on the phone. Do not back up the emotional dump truck and pull the lever. Don’t name your future kids together in month one, and save the “I love you” until you can commit to loving them. [Guard your heart](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:23&version=NIV1984) and their heart.  \n  \n  \n  \nLearn to be a little more strategic in your divulging of secrets. As in, 1) don’t have secrets, and 2) don’t tell every personal detail of your life and emotions on the first date. Time is your friend.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Trusting a promise over performance**  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is a big one. Actions speak way louder than words. A person’s reputation goes before them, and you should take advantage of this early warning system.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis will save you a lot of grief. Remember the guy that moved to your high school and had all of these crazy stories about his past life that no one could verify? That’s because he was lying. It is easy to get away with lies when no one cares to verify your story. So, consider their dating history. Yes, people do change, and God restores. However, the cheat says, “I’ve changed, I promise. Trust me.” The trustworthy guy says, “Don’t trust me. Watch me. Over time, I will prove it.”  \n  \n  \n  \nReputations are important. Yes, there is grace and forgiveness. However, like I said before, time is your friend. Don’t decide if someone is worthy of your attention based on a promise; decide based on someone’s past performance and your own observations of them as you serve together.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Trusting feelings over community**  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen you begin to have feelings about someone, it is like putting a magnet by a compass. The compass doesn’t work and points in the wrong direction and everything is compromised.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat is why you have to pick your head up and ask others if you are going the right direction. Just because something feels right does not at all guarantee that it is right (see [Proverbs 14:12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2014:12&version=NIV1984)). If everyone in your life is jumping up and down and shouting “You are going the wrong way!!!!” …it is only because you are. Stop, and turn around. Your feelings can’t be trusted when others who love you and are yielded to the Holy Spirit, are telling you that you are being an idiot. Listen to them.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn the end, it is not about rules or a list of tips and tricks. It really all comes down to trusting God and believing what He says. A spouse will not truly “complete” you, and marriage is not the be-all, end-all—but God is. And He wants you to have a full life ([John 10:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&version=NIV1984)); He offers to give you the desires of your heart ([Psalm 37:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2037:4&version=NIV1984)); and He is fully capable of having all things work out for the good of those who love Him ([Romans 8:28](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:28&version=NIV1984)). Seek God first, listen to the wisdom in His Word, and give His way a try.  \n  \n  \n  \nJP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"dating-101-getting-serious"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/dating-101-getting-serious/"}}},

Though I didn’t always say it that directly, I often felt outraged by their rules and regulations, or their disapproval of my choices and relationships.  \n  \n  \n  \nIs it right to tell someone what they should or should not do? Parents do. Governments do. Authorities of all sorts do, and sources of wisdom often guide us in what we should or should not do. Places in the world where freedom is best experienced, are places with good laws that sometimes protect people from themselves.  \n  \n  \n  \nHere is another question that has been popularized in the media lately: **is it right to tell someone who they can love?** At first glance, that question may tug at your heart, and the obvious answer would be “absolutely not!” After all, that is how I felt back in high school when my parents said they had concerns about an older and “more experienced” girl I was dating. How dare they stick their nose in my business? Haters.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut let’s look a little bit deeper into that question. What if an adult is romantically in love with a 6-year-old? Would that be wrong, and would you be wrong for telling them so? Or what if some person was in love with your spouse, and was trying to break up your marriage? Is it not then OK to tell them that certain people are not available for them to love?  \n  \n  \n  \nIn reality, most everyone agrees that there are times when it is actually quite necessary to tell someone who they can or cannot romantically love. In some cases, we will even rightly hold people harshly accountable if they do not stand up and say it is wrong (see Penn State). We take these stands for the good of one or both of the parties involved. Even within the realm of consenting adult relationships, people are often attracted to people who will hurt them (or be hurt by them). A simple glance at the staggering divorce rate would show you that we are, on average, terrible at choosing who we love. Most people spend their entire adult lives trying to choose someone to spend the rest of their lives with, and statistically most people fail miserably at that task.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy parents didn’t hate me when they said not to go to South Padre on Spring Break at 17, even though I desperately wanted to go. I understood that even then. In fact, the only reason and motivation for them saying anything was because they loved me, and wanted the best for me. If they didn’t care at all about me, they would have kept silent. If they had truly hated me and wanted to do me harm, they would have _encouraged_ me to do those things instead of speaking against them.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Current Debate**  \n  \nSo what does this have to do with the here and now? Well, I am sure you are familiar with the recent backlash against a company, Chick-Fil-A, because of some comments made by the company’s president. The president, Dan Cathy, stated (when asked) in [an interview](http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=38271) that the company supported the “Biblical definition of the family unit.” The response to that by many advocates of gay marriage has been, essentially, “WHY DO YOU HATE ME?!” There has been public condemnation of the company as a whole, and specific threats to deny business permits to the company’s independent franchisees.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs a friend put it, it seems that any comment these days that does not celebrate homosexuality is considered homophobic and hateful. So I want to be very clear: I am not homophobic. (Let’s talk. Meet for coffee? I am not afraid.) I have family and friends who are gay, and I do not hate anyone who identifies themselves as homosexual. In fact, what I do hate is that the church at large has not known how to respond to this issue; I am sure that this, over time, has led to the frustration that is now being expressed and targeted at Mr. Cathy. I’d like to address this below, but for the best message I have ever heard on this problem with the church and homosexuality, [click here](http://www.watermark.org/media/homosexuality-and-same-sex-marriage-an-apology-an-answer-an-assignment/457/).  \n  \n  \n  \n**Where Christians Go Wrong**  \n  \nIt seems like the church usually makes one of two mistakes when it comes to homosexuality. The first is that many Christians treat homosexuals as outsiders, or as a kind of unknown “other.” They condemn homosexuality as a sin, but do nothing to love the sinner. They may gladly show love and grace to people with most any other kind of sin; after all, they are sinners themselves. And though all sin carries the same eternal consequences, it seems people hold up this one sin as being somehow worse than heterosexual sin, or lying, or the love of money, or overeating. Gay people are essentially shunned, sort of like the lepers of Jesus’ time who had to shout “unclean!” so that no one would accidentally touch them and catch the contagious disease. Oh, and how did Jesus respond to lepers? He reached out to them. ([Matthew 8:1-3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%208:1-3&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \n  \n  \nThe other mistake that some Christians make is that they do try to love the gay community, but they do so at the expense of truth. They think that “loving” someone means encouraging them to do whatever they want, regardless of consequences. But actions _do_ have consequences, and therefore speaking the truth is often the most loving thing to do—even when it is uncomfortable, or may produce a hateful backlash. You don’t _encourage_ an alcoholic to drink, unless you really do hate that person and want to see them hurt. Again, the example to follow is Jesus, who when talking to someone in the midst of sexual sin, did not condemn the person, but did tell her to “Go now and leave your life of sin.” ([John 8:11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:11&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \n  \n  \n**An Inconvenient Truth**  \n  \nNow, a few of you may be saying, “What consequences?” You may particularly wonder this if you do not believe in God, and therefore reject the concept of sin. But here’s the thing: sin can be freely forgiven anyway, and that slate completely wiped clean; that’s what Jesus came for, and that is the [Good News](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:1-5&version=NIV1984). However, there are still earthly consequences. God only tells us not to do things because those are not the best things for us to do. In the case of homosexual activity, there are significant consequences to your quality of life (based on mental and physical health statistics) and even to your quantity of life (based on average life expectancy). To provide one example, the STD rates among practicing homosexuals are much higher than for heterosexuals. I’m not talking about being a few percentage points more likely to contract certain diseases. I’m talking about being _45 times_ more likely to contract infections like HIV and syphilis. (Is it “hateful” to point out such things? Well, blame the haters at the [Centers for Disease Control](http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/Newsroom/msmpressrelease.html)).  \n  \n  \n  \nOne of the reasons for the particular problem of disease is that the human body is not designed to handle homosexual activities, and has no built-in defense mechanisms for preventing infection that way. You see, God does have a design for sexuality and how love can be expressed through it. He has designed us male and female, with parts that do go together to serve a purpose. Even the pleasure of sex serves a purpose—that a husband would bond to his wife and a wife to her husband ([Genesis 2:24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:24&version=NIV1984)), as science has confirmed happens due to the release of chemicals in the brain. And through that, babies can be born into families and our species can continue. Any time we try to capture the pleasure of sex apart from God’s design—whether it be through heterosexual adultery, premarital sex, homosexual acts, pornography, bestiality, whatever—we are setting ourselves up for hurt. I am not saying these acts are all the same. I am saying they all have consequences because they are not according to God's design. Even the best-case scenario outside of God’s plan is still only second-best; it is still not the fullness of what God intends through a Godly marriage.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn light of that, it would be unloving not to say something when it could potentially save someone from hurt.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Choose Freedom**  \n  \n  \nSo, what about people who say they were born gay? I will not argue with anyone's experience or when their particular feelings started. I know most people do not consciously choose their desires and feelings. The causes of same-sex desire can be complex, as [explained here](http://www.watermark.org/media/same-sex-bonding/1980/). But, as humans, we can each choose what we do with our desires.  \n  \n  \n  \nI have, since a young age, had strong sexual desires that did not fit with God’s ideal. They were heterosexual desires, and led to heterosexual sins—but again, that doesn’t make them less wrong. Everyone has desires that seem right to us, but bring about pain in our lives. We are in a process of denying ourselves these desires and pursuing a greater freedom found only in relationship with Christ. We seek help if needed. When we act according to those desires, there is forgiveness available. But we are not to embrace our flaws. We should embrace the _flawed_, which is everyone, but love them enough to speak the truth and help them find the freedom that Christ offers.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is what I am absolutely sure of: marriage was \"born straight,\" and has always been that way. It was invented by the Designer of sex. Marriage comes from God. Why would we want God's invention of marriage and not God's ideal, or God Himself?  \n  \n  \n  \nIs it hateful to say, as Mr. Cathy did, that God’s plan for marriage is best? Is it hateful to try to help someone overcome a struggle that they desperately want to overcome? Is it hateful to want to spare people from hurt and pain? Undesired love is often called hate. I doubt Chick-Fil-A hates you. I certainly don't hate you. God, who most definitely supports the “Biblical definition of the family unit,” does not hate you. He is crazy about you, and _for that reason_ offers up truth.  \n  \n  \n  \n[Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013:6&version=NIV1984). Want to fully love someone? Speak the truth. Want to be fully loved? Embrace the truth.  \n  \n  \n  \nJP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"why-do-you-hate-me"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-do-you-hate-me/"}}},

Sex within dating. Premarital sex.  \n  \nIt is amazing the wide range of opinions on the subject. Some within the church would wonder why we even need to be talking about it; of _course_ you shouldn’t have sex outside of marriage. At the other end, a big percentage of people outside the church would think that viewpoint is crazy, and would argue that you not only can but _should_ have sex before marriage. Somewhere in the middle you would have secularists who agree that premarital sex is a bad idea, and Christians who try to argue that it is not actually a sin.  \n  \nTruth is truth, though, whether you choose to believe it or not. Premarital sex is a sin. Even if you don’t believe that or don’t believe in God at all, premarital sex is still, at best, a bad idea.  \n\n##### **Clearing up misconceptions about premarital sex**\n  \nI’ll talk about why it is a bad idea, even for readers who do not believe in God or sin, in an [upcoming post](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/). First, I want to address Christ-followers here to clear up any misconceptions about what the Bible has to say about it.  \n  \nI’ve run into Christians who want to argue that having sex while single is not actually a sin. And I get where you are coming from; there was a time when I tried to make the same justification. The argument goes something like this: the Bible really just talks about not committing adultery, but you can’t commit adultery unless you are already married. Right? Well, yes and no—but the “no” cancels out the “yes” you are looking for.  \n  \nFirst off, remember that Jesus said [you don’t even have to have sex to commit adultery](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:27-28&version=NIV1984), so quit trying to minimize God’s commands so that you can seemingly “get away with” things that clearly are not God’s ideal for us. Any time you find yourself looking for loopholes, it means that you are trying to do what is intended to be wrong and somehow just escape the consequences for it. There is no one as creative as someone in the middle of self-justification.  \n  \nSecondly, and more importantly, the Bible _does_ say that premarital sex is a sin. Many times. Here is one of them:  \n  \n_Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. – 1 Corinthians 6:9-10_  \n  \nThis mentions adultery, but it also mentions something different from adultery: sexual immorality, or what is sometimes translated into English as “fornication”. The meaning of “fornication” is clear enough, but what some people will do is argue that the original Greek word, _pornea_, has been misinterpreted. The word basically means “a forbidden sexual pleasure”, and some people have argued that it had a very narrow meaning and referred only to sex that was part of idol worship. Those people say that it is fine to have premarital sex, as long as you are not doing it in a pagan temple.  \n  \nIt is essentially impossible that Biblical authors wrote the word with that suspiciously narrow definition in mind, though. Look at how Paul, the author of 1 Corinthians, used the exact same word just a few sentences later:  \n  \n_But since there is so much immorality (pornea), each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. – 1 Corinthians 7:2_  \n  \nPaul is an extremely logical person, and his practical solution to the problem of _pornea_ was to get married. Why was that the solution? Because within marriage you can have sex. He actually spends [the rest of that paragraph](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%207:1-7&version=NIV1984) encouraging married people to have sex together more often, and specifically tells the unmarried that “it is better to marry than to burn with passion” if they find they “cannot control themselves” ([verse 9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%207:9&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \nIf he was talking specifically about idols, marriage would not be the solution; you can be married and worship idols. He is clearly and very frankly talking about sexual release within marriage as a solution to the problem. And if Paul’s logical solution to the problem is sexual release, why doesn’t he offer premarital sex or masturbation as options? Wouldn’t those be the most practical solutions to the problem of _pornea_?  \n  \nThe reason he doesn’t list premarital sex as a solution is because _premarital sex is the problem_. Premarital sex is _pornea_, and it is _pornea_ whether it happens in a temple or not. That is why his solution to the problem, for those who could not control it, was marriage.  \n\n##### **Premarital sex is more than a sin - it's a really bad idea**\n  \nSo, yes, premarital sex (or any sex outside of marriage) is clearly a sin. We should consider _why_ God would forbid it, though. He is not out to spoil your fun, and any “rules” God gives us are only mentioned because they are in our best interests. He wants to save you from trouble and keep you from unnecessary pain. In other words, even if you don’t believe in God or refuse to believe it is a sin, premarital sex is still a (really) bad idea.  \n  \nWe’ll talk more about that, though, [in a later post](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/).  \n  \nJP"},"url":{"en-US":"why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/"}}},

Inside each envelope was cash.  \n  \n  \n  \nA total of $5,100 was given out to the roughly 1,500 young adults at The Porch that night. Most people received $2 bills (yes, they still make those), but some people received $5, $10, $20, or $50—and one person received a crisp new $100 bill.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe money came with [some instructions](http://www.watermark.org/media/stewardship/2175/):\n\n  \n- First off, the money did not belong to them. It had been given by a number of anonymous individuals, who wanted that money to be used to meet needs. The people receiving the envelopes were stewards tasked with using the money to fulfill that purpose and meet needs.\n  \n- Each person must pray about how to steward that money.\n  \n- The money could not be given to the church.\n  \n- They must do _something_ with the money; doing nothing was not an option.\n  \n- They were asked to email back and give an account for how they used the money.\n  \n  \nBelow are some examples of the responses we received back.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Shopping Trip**  \n  \nI was one of the lucky recipients of $20 and the next day I was approached by a man named Don who was homeless and said he needed clothing. I took him to Walmart and walked around and helped him shop for clothes. This was a humbling experience -- to see what he needed, and to think of all I had been blessed with that I didn't deserve. He got two pairs of pants, two shirts, socks, underwear and a gift card for his family. When it was all said and done, we spent $207.80. He was overjoyed and felt like God had granted him a favor. I was able to share my faith with him and gave him the opportunity to ask questions, then dropped him off downtown and told him I would be praying for him.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Food Bank Deposit**  \n  \nMy envelope had $20 enclosed. I was so moved by the gesture that I decided to donate $1,000 to the North Texas Food Bank that feeds the needy in the Dallas area. And not only that, but NTFB has a campaign going on now that doubles your contribution. Therefore, because I was entrusted with $20, that amount was multiplied by 100 so that $2,000 in total went to benefit the less fortunate!  \n  \n  \n  \nPieces of the Puzzle  \n  \nEvery day as I drive home I there is this homeless man that lives under the bridge at an intersection near my house. My plan was to have three sealed envelopes, approach him, and make a deal with him. Inside each envelope was an amount of money and a puzzle piece that I made from computer paper.  \n  \n  \n  \nI approached the homeless man (who was named Randy) the first day with the three envelopes. The deal was that he could choose one of the envelopes each day for 3 days. We each made 2 promises to each other. First, I promised Randy that each time he picks an envelope the gift inside will be better than the day before. Second, I promised him that the third gift could possibly save his [eternal] life. In return, I had him promise me that after he opened each envelope he would hang on to each puzzle piece for the next time I saw him, and that I could have five minutes of his time after the third day. We shook on it!  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen I first approached him and introduced myself to him on day 1, I had three envelopes all with $5 and all the same puzzle piece. Day 2, the two envelopes had $10 and again identical puzzle pieces (but different from the day 1 piece). And for D-Day (as I called it) the envelope contained the $2 from the Porch and the last puzzle piece.  \n  \n  \n  \nA buddy of mine was with me on the D-Day when Randy opened the final envelope. Although the 3rd envelope only had $2 in it, there was the missing puzzle piece that made a cross. When I taped the 3 together he said, “That's a cross, this is a Jesus deal!” The fact that the money did not matter in his zero-income eyes, but that the computer-paper-taped-together-cross was, in fact, better than the previous $5 and $10 melted my heart and almost brought tears to my own eyes. He did let me talk to him about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as he went on to tell me about his testimony. After it was all said and done, the three of us gathered in a circle arm-to-arm to pray to God that we would all continue to walk in the name of our Lord and in the life that He has marked out for us.  \n  \n  \n  \nScholarship Fund  \n  \nI recently met a new Porch volunteer. Last Friday, we ran into each other at a party. As I asked the obligatory \"How's it going\", he started to open up and be vulnerable right away. He mentioned that he was stressed financially; he had recently moved into a new place (but was considering having another guy move into his place just to make ends meet) and his car had lots of mechanical issues. All of this financial stress was causing him to consider dropping out of school (seminary) for a semester. As I listened to more of his story, I was amazed at how positive he was, knowing he was in the midst of a difficult season.  \n  \n  \n  \nI left the party and his story continued to weigh on me. As I brought this up to some roommates, it turned out that they knew him much better than I did and had both been praying about it, but didn't really know how to help.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe ultimately decided to do a scholarship for his next semester at seminary. We wrestled with how much to give, and challenged a couple of friends to pray about it. As I started to tell more people about this person's story, they responded, “I know that guy, I am in. Tell me how much?” I continued to pray about it and encouraged others to do the same. 11 people participated, and had received a total of $44 at The Porch. We ended up giving $3,712 toward his tuition. Hopefully this student will go on to build many disciple makers in his ministry after school.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Simplify**  \n  \nSo I went to The Porch and received an envelope with a $2 bill in it. I have been thinking long and hard about how to grow this $2 for God (because obviously it is His money and I don't want to mess this up). I have decided that until I have a better idea I will do the following things with it:  \n\n  \n1. I have taped it to the inside of my front door to remind me when I leave the house every day that ALL of my money and time was given to me by God. I will need to give account for how I used it, so I want to administer it wisely.\n  \n2. My first response to #1 above is that each weekend I will spend at least 2 minutes identifying at least 2 things I have that I can give to charity or to a person in need. (Starting out it may be more like 2 boxes than just 2 things!) As I am doing this I will reflect on how wasteful it is to buy things that I rarely (or never) end up using or how blessed I am to have received gifts from others, which I can now pass on to other people who can get more use out of them. I will do this until I am down to only the things that I absolutely need and nothing more.\n  \n  \n**Reconcile**  \n  \nI have a younger sister who used to attend Watermark/The Porch but no longer does. I have always had anger, hostility, and resentment towards her after she become pregnant at a young age on multiple offenses.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen I received the envelope, I placed it with another envelope containing my paycheck for the last two weeks. I had been so busy that I hadn't gotten around to depositing it yet. God began convicting me that He had better plans for that money than I did.  \n  \n  \n  \nTuesday morning in the car, God placed it on my heart to send the entire check to my sister. My sister had just recently gotten her first job, at 20 years old. She has been struggling to just pay for daycare and gas, and her car was in need of a tune-up. I called my sister to apologize for my actions, to ask for forgiveness for how I have treated her in the past, and to share with her what Christ has taught me this month. I then went on to tell her about our last lesson at the Porch and the assignment. God had placed her on my mind and I wanted to share my check with her and meet a need in her life.  \n  \n  \n  \nShe began to cry, and told me that just that morning she had gone to get food stamps and was told that she made too much money to qualify for the program. She didn't know how she was going to provide for her son. She was frustrated, because she felt like she was trying this time and that things just weren't going in her favor, and she had prayed and asked God to take control.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt turns out that she has a friend who is able to do the tune up for a fraction of the cost, so the money that I had envisioned for her was meeting her needs way more than I thought He could.

There were many great stories—more than 85,000 words worth of stories, in fact, which is approximately the length of a 300-page novel.  \n  \n  \n  \nThough we cannot list all of that here, we did want to share a few more stories about how the money was stewarded.  \n  \n[![MoneyWise envelope](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/moneywise-envelope2.jpg \"Moneywise envelope\")](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/moneywise-envelope2.jpg)  \n  \nThe $100 Bill  \n  \nMy wife and I do not live in Dallas, but we were in town visiting our daughter and went to The Porch service with her. It was a great service and I am going to continue to [watch the stewardship series via the internet](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/266/).  \n  \n  \n  \nI was the one who got the $100 bill. At first, I was very burdened by that. But as I prayed about it more and more, God told me that He would show me what I needed to do, and I didn’t need to be burdened.  \n  \n  \n  \nTwo days later, at a regular Bible study we attend, a visiting missionary spoke about her work. She has an orphanage in Kenya for young girls that have been sexually and physically abused. She explained that they had just acquired 22 acres of land and built a road to it. She wanted to expand and create a safer and more self-sufficient facility.  \n  \n  \n  \nI gave the $100, plus another $100, to the orphanage. I have also committed to help her buy some goats, a cow, or chickens in the future.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis was a great experience for me and I have never felt as good about giving as I do now. This has changed the way I see things.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Skeptic**  \n  \nI received a $10 bill in my envelope from The Porch. All week I have been praying about how to steward this money.  \n  \n  \n  \nOn Monday, a guy in my class walked up to me and asked if I could talk for a second. I was hesitant, but agreed. He shared a bit of his story with me and how he is going through a really hard time in his life. He said he wanted to know my story, because he felt like there was something different about me and had to know. (Editor’s note: see [1 Peter 3:15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203:15&version=NIV1984).) I used this as an opportunity to share my testimony. Afterwards, he just looked at me and started laughing and told me that he was an atheist. He asked me if I really believed that God was able to \"make good out of bad things.\" I told him I absolutely believed that. We then started talking about family, and I told him how my brother is in seminary. He again laughed, but said he thought that was interesting. I felt like God was telling me to get him a ticket to \"[Contending with Christianity's Critics](http://www.watermark.org/contending-with-christianitys-critics/)\" conference, so I did. He is interested and excited about it. I know that it is still a little bit away, so I'm praying that God uses this time to stir in his heart.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Myron and Richard**  \n  \nLate Wednesday night I went to get gas and was approached by a man who was offering to wash my windows on my car. I said “no thanks,” but struck up a conversation and began to find out a bit more about him. (His name was Myron, he was former military, had been unemployed for a few years, and was trying to get back on his feet.) He kept offering to wash my windows, but I asked him what I could do for him and what he really needed. He said that he needed a shirt and some pants; his were quite worn. So, I told him to hop in and we would go to Target.  \n  \n  \n  \nOn the way to Target, he quickly showed me how he had just gotten a new copy of his birth certificate, which will be huge in helping him get a job. His excitement about that, combined with his excitement that he would have some new threads to go into his interview with, was a true joy to watch. I discussed with him that God had put it on my heart to do something nice for someone. I talked briefly about what God has done in my life, how He views us, and what He wants for each of us. He briefly discussed his on again/off again relationship with God.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs we went into Target I told him we were going to get whatever he needed, not just a shirt and pants. We picked up toiletries and clothes. After noticing his inability to read any of the sizes, tags, or signage, I also got him a few pairs of much-needed reading glasses. It was the glasses he was most thrilled about (so he \"can read job applications,\" or anything for that matter). As we went around the store, he kept talking to himself and then saying, \"Thank You Jesus!\" We got some funny looks from people.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs we were wrapping up, he asked my name again. When I told him “Richard,” his face went into complete shock and he became extremely emotional. I asked him what the significance of that was. He told me that he had someone who looked out for him, an older friend/mentor named Richard, who had passed away right before Memorial Day. He said that was tough on him and had set him back. He always worried that he had disappointed Richard. I told him maybe this was God's way and Richard's way of letting him know that he has not disappointed them, that they love him, and that they are looking out for him. After he composed himself, I gave him my contact info and told him to contact me when he gets back on his feet.  \n  \n  \n  \nI am really praying for my friend Myron and hoping to hear from him in the near future. I ask that you will do the same  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Beatboxing Lemonade Stand**  \n  \nOur family didn't get an envelope, so we just pretended to have a two dollar one. We took it to the dollar store and bought lemonade and cookies. The kids decided to also use their tooth fairy money to buy popsicles. They set up a lemonade stand and sold lemonade, cookies, and popsicles. They then decided to sell songs and beatboxing. They actually made the most money from beatboxing. Overall they made about $40, and we went to the store and used that money to buy food for one of the single moms at Watermark who is really struggling financially right now. They were super excited about it and I loved the lesson—thanks for doing it!!  \n  \n  \n  \n**Gospel and Groceries**  \n  \nA friend and I were each given $2, and after The Porch on Tuesday, we brainstormed about how we could be good stewards with the money. He came up with the idea of heading over to a local Walmart, paying for someone's groceries, and then sharing the gospel with them afterwards.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo to Walmart we went. We sat in his car before entering, and asked the Lord to direct our path and point out someone who not only needed the financial assistance, but who needed Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn we went, and the first person we talked with said she did not need financial help, but could use some prayer. We prayed for her, her friend, and the two children that were with them.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe moved on, and as we walked down the aisles, I had the strong feeling that I needed to speak with a family that we passed by. They too said they didn't need help financially, but that they were new to Dallas and looking for a new church, and wanted to resurrect a dry relationship with Jesus. We had a long talk about Christ, and told them about Watermark. Then we prayed for them and their children.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe continued walking, and asking folks if they needed help, and ALL of them said no. After nearly an hour, we were feeling a bit discouraged. We decided to move to the checkout line and just pay for someone as the Lord guided.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe got to the front of the line, and I walked around, feeling extremely nervous, clutching my wallet like the money was my own. But then my friend started talking with a couple who had a newborn baby. He introduced me, and we began to tell them that we were doing the Lord's work and would like to pay for their groceries. A look of bewilderment passed over the woman's face, and she accepted our offer. In her hand, she was clutching a food stamps card, which she quickly stuck back in her wallet.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe total bill came to about $180, and my buddy and I split the cost. Afterwards, we told them how much Jesus loved them, and that he knows their struggles and wants a relationship with them. We invited them to Watermark, and told them about the resources there. We closed in prayer, and went on our way.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt truly blessed me to see my friend’s giving heart. I was reluctant to give because I am a recent college graduate and don't have much money. The thing is, so is my friend, yet he had no trouble at all giving what he had. Not only were we able to bless others, but I learned a lesson in faith: the money is not my own, and even if I were called to give all I had, then I should do so cheerfully.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Totals**  \n  \nThe 450 responses we received represented $1,602 of the $5,100 that was handed out. Those people gave away that $1,602, _plus_ an additional $55,196, for a total of $56,798 given to meet needs in our city and around the world. That is more than 35 times the amount that stewarded.  \n  \n  \n  \nOf course, the real “stewardship challenge” is not this one-time event, but is the challenge of treating all of our resources and talents as what they are: God’s resources entrusted to accomplish His purposes.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow have you changed the way you steward money?\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"the-stewardship-challenge-part-2"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-stewardship-challenge-part-2/"}}},

His body was cremated; ashes are all that remains.  \n  \n  \n  \nNicky is not dead.  \n  \n  \n  \nAccording to [his obituary](http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Alberto-Boisse&lc=2201&pid=159193775&mid=5205436&locale=en-US), Nicky was born 28 years ago, on September 19, 1983. But he, like every one of us, was born a dying man. It is the nature of the beast, of this universe we inhabit, that everyone and everything is in a constant state of decay. Though the actual ending may come suddenly and unexpectedly, it is invariably a slow death: We age. We become sick. Our hearts break. We feel pain. We cry.  \n  \n  \n  \nNicky will never cry again.  \n  \n  \n  \nNo person of this world ever has, and no one ever will, overcome death in its many forms. Not of their own effort, or through technology, or right living. We are powerless to change our fate. Our bodies, our homes, our gravestones, and even the entirety of Earth itself will eventually be gone. None of it will last forever.  \n  \n  \n  \nNicky will live forever.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf measured by this world alone, you might consider Nicky to have been unfortunate. 28 years seems like such a short time. Nicky served at [The Porch](http://theporchdallas.com/), which is full of people about his age, and most people there do not really think that they will die this day, or this year, or even this decade. Someday, each of them will be wrong about that.  \n  \n  \n  \nNicky realized that he did not have power over death, but he also recognized that there was One who did. One who was in this world, but not of this world, and not bound to this world’s laws. The only One who has ever suffered through all of our pain, and trials, and death, and yet had the power to then bring His dead body back to life. Nicky knew this One with the power to defeat death, who has overcome the curse and offers the same to us out of His unfathomable goodness and love.  \n  \n  \n  \nNicky chose to accept this free gift years ago. And though this gift did not heal Nicky’s physical body or make it any less temporary, it did remove the power of such troubles and the ultimate power of death over him. Nicky’s time in this broken world was kept short, and those who knew him grieve for their own loss. But Nicky is not dead. He is finally fully alive.  \n  \n  \n  \nMany of you will choose not to believe as Nicky did. Though he testified to its truth, you would claim it is a lie. You might even be willing to bet your life on your claim that Nicky is wrong. You are free to make that choice, but understand that is exactly what you are doing: betting your life. Because one thing is absolutely certain: you and Nicky cannot both be right. One of you will be dead wrong.  \n  \n  \n  \nNicky Boisse is alive.

I was in Oklahoma City visiting family at the [Range Round-up](http://www.okcattlemen.org/whatistheocarangeround-up1.aspx), a statewide ranch rodeo.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt struck me that you would never hear that in Dallas. You wouldn’t expect the announcer at a Mavericks game to report on a simple rain shower. And if he did, you certainly wouldn’t expect what happened next: the crowd responded with the loudest cheer of the night.  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, on that day, and in that place, it made perfect sense. The entire state had been in a severe drought all summer long. At a ranch rodeo—a team competition between different ranches—most of the crowd was involved in agriculture in some way. For farmers and ranchers, a drought doesn’t simply mean that you have to water the lawn more often. It means that your crops don’t grow, and your cattle don’t have grass to eat or water to drink. It affects your income, sometimes meaning that you don’t have any income that entire _year_. For such a crowd, an August rainstorm was really, really good news.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt isn’t always that way. Popular culture seems to portray farmers as constantly praying for rain. Having grown up on a farm/ranch, though, I remember there being many more times when we prayed it would _not_ rain. Having too much rain, or rain at the wrong time, can be just as damaging as not having rain at all. Rain during harvest means you can’t bring in the crops. Rain during planting season means you can’t even get the seeds in the ground. Too much rain at any one time, and it all gets washed away in a flood. There have been years when the announcement of rain at that rodeo would have brought groans.  \n  \n  \n  \nSame rain. Same crowd. Vastly different results.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis applies not only to rain, but to a large number of things in life. Some things that are good at the right time and place can be extremely bad in the wrong situations. Sex would be one example, when you consider its purpose in marriage compared to how it is often misused. Sugar could even qualify: bad if that is all you eat, but a great treat if it is kept somewhat rare.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe same thing can cause either life or death, joy or sadness, depending on the timing.  \n  \n  \n  \nHere’s a thought: what if the droughts are necessary? It is the classic question of why God allows bad things to happen. It’s been said that evil is not a thing in itself; it is merely the absence of good. But if everything was always good, then we wouldn’t consider it “good” at all; it would simply “be.” Without the occasional dry spell, would we ever find joy in rain?  \n  \n  \n  \nHonestly, this all comes up because recently I have felt like I am in a pretty severe drought. I’ve been shaken out of contentment, reminded that there are good things, things that God even says are good, that haven’t been falling in my life. God is in control; why has He withheld rain?  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd here is the only answer I can come up with: I don’t know. There is no way for me to know how life might have been different, or to say it would be better or worse. I can’t see the future, or see what God has in store.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut I have seen how rain is often not the blessing we had hoped for. And how waiting for something can greatly increase the joy of receiving it. And how He does, indeed, make what seems to be bad [turn out for good](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A28&version=NIV1984) in the end.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd so I trust, or strive to trust, in God’s timing. To believe more fully in His goodness. To remember that I am often not a good judge of what will make me happy. And to realize that nothing outside of Him will truly satisfy anyway.  \n  \n  \n  \nI trust, and I wait. But I’m still praying for rain.  \n  \n  \n  \n_- [Kevin McConaghy](https://plus.google.com/108225385241400201197?rel=author)_\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"when-rain-delays"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/when-rain-delays/"}}},

The music that is currently popular both says a lot _to_ our generation, and _about_ our generation.  \n  \n  \n  \nOne group that has had a big impact on the music scene this year is the band “Fun.” Their anthem “We Are Young” reached #1 on the Billboard charts for six straight weeks earlier this year, setting sales records in the process. The rousing chorus sounds like an inspirational call to action:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Tonight  \nWe are young  \nSo let’s set the world on fire  \nWe can burn brighter than the sun_    \n  \n  \n  \nIf you listen to just the chorus, you might think that the song is going to go on to say something great, like we want to go out and make a difference. We are the new generation, so let’s go out and change all that is wrong about this place. Let’s start a revolution.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut then you listen to the rest of the song, and realize that they are talking about an evening at the bar getting drunk and high. Their version of “burn[ing] brighter than the sun” is to get so completely wasted that someone has to “carry you home.”  \n  \n  \n  \nI don’t think that Fun is trying to make any particular point with that song; they are just being honest. And they get even more honest on their second big hit, “Some Nights,” which is also the title of their current album. The chorus on this one almost resembles a gospel choir, especially when they reference The Lord. But the lyrics are borderline depressing:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh  \nWhat do I stand for? What do I stand for?  \nMost nights, I don't know_    \n  \n  \n  \nThat seems to be the biggest theme of Some Nights, both the song and the album: being lost, with no purpose in life, seeking life in temporary pleasures and finding no lasting joy in it.  \n  \n  \n  \n_So this is it? I sold my soul for this?  \nWashed my hands of that for this?_    \n  \n  \n  \n_Well, that is it guys, that is all - five minutes in and I'm bored again  \nTen years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands_    \n  \n  \n  \n_And that's alright; I found a martyr in my bed tonight  \nShe stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am  \nOh, who am I?_    \n  \n  \n  \nOh, well that’s nice. A woman he “found” in his bed becomes a martyr for the purpose of taking his mind off his problems for one night.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd how familiar does this sound?  \n  \n  \n  \n_My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she called \"love\"  \nWhen I look into my nephew's eyes...  \nMan, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from...  \nSome terrible lies_    \n  \n  \n  \nSo he is pro-life, apparently.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd that is all from the song “Some Nights”; I could go on and on with the other songs on the _Some Nights_ album. The most optimistic-sounding title, “It Gets Better,” is actually about losing one’s virginity, and starts with the repeated line:  \n  \n  \n  \n_What have we done, oh my God  \nWhat have we done, oh my God_    \n  \n  \n  \nThe song “All Alright” explains how things are not at all alright:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Yeah it's all alright  \nI guess it's all alright  \nI got nothing left inside of my chest,  \nBut it's all alright_    \n  \n  \n  \nObviously fame, drinking, drugs, dating, and sex have not made the creators of _Some Nights_ happy or brought them satisfaction. The same can be said for this generation as a whole: though they focus on finding meaning in concentrated “fun” and freedom from rules, millenials have a higher rate of depression than any other generation.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe singer realizes that this life is not working out for him, but repeatedly talks about carrying on, somewhat blindly, because no one is going to save him. From “Stars”:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Oh, and you  \nYou're always holding on to stars  \nI think they're better from afar  \nBecause no one is gonna save us_    \n  \n  \n  \n_Oh, and me  \nI have faded in the dark  \nSo don't you ever kiss me  \nDon't you wish on me  \nWhy can't you see that no one's gonna save us?_    \n  \n  \n  \nThe thing is, there is One who really can save people from such a meaningless, temporary life. The real problem is not that they don’t know where to look, but that they are unwilling to do so. Take the lyrics from “Some Nights (Intro),” which is the first track on the album and serves as a lead-in to the title song:  \n  \n  \n  \n_There are some nights I wait for someone to save us  \nBut I never look inward, try not to look upward_    \n  \n  \n  \n“Never look inward, try not to look upward.” To me, that sounds like a really good recipe for a wasted life.  \n  \n  \n  \n_And some nights I pray a sign is gonna come to me  \nBut usually, I'm just trying to get some sleep  \nSome Nights_    \n  \n  \n  \n“Fun”? Not so fun.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"sounds-like-fun"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/sounds-like-fun/"}}},

Ever since the beginning, our Creator has designed us and called us to live life with others. But don't take my word for it when you can take His. There are actually over thirty \"One Anothers\" in God's Word.  \n  \n  \n  \nLet's take a look at a few (there are many more):  \n  \n  \n  \n_Let us consider how we may spur ONE ANOTHER on toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting TOGETHER, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage ONE ANOTHER – and all the more as you see the Day approaching. - Hebrews 10:24-25_  \n  \n  \n  \n_But encourage ONE ANOTHER daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness. - Hebrews 3:13_  \n  \n  \n  \n_Therefore confess your sins TO EACH OTHER and pray for EACH OTHER so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective. - James 5:16_  \n  \n  \n  \n_He who walks with the wise grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm. - Proverbs 13:20_  \n  \n  \n  \n_As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another. - Proverbs 27:17_  \n  \n  \n  \n_Carry EACH OTHER'S burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. - Galatians 6:2_  \n  \n  \n  \n_Bear with ONE ANOTHER in love. - Ephesians 4:2_  \n  \n  \n  \n_He who trusts in himself is a fool. - Proverbs 28:26_  \n  \n  \n  \n_There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death. - Proverbs 14:12 AND Proverbs 16:25_  \n  \n  \n  \n_The way of a fool seems right to him, but a wise man listens to advice. - Proverbs 12:15_  \n  \n  \n  \n_Faithful are the wounds of a friend. - Proverbs 27:6_  \n  \n  \n  \n_He who separates himself seeks his own desire, He quarrels against all sound wisdom. - Proverbs 18:1_  \n  \n  \n  \n_Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work: If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up! Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken. - Ecclesiastes 4:9-12_  \n  \n  \n  \n_Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed. - Proverbs 15:22_  \n  \n  \n  \n_Make plans by seeking advice; if you wage war, obtain guidance. - Proverbs 20:18_  \n  \n  \n  \nAs we embark on a new journey together through this community blog, we will continue to call you to biblical community and hopefully make a compelling case that God's absolute best is for you and me to be surrounded by others who love us and can encourage us as we grow in our relationship with our Creator.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe would love to help you plug into community at Watermark and walk through the process alongside you.

The night before each of our children have been born I have written them a letter. This was written Wednesday, 2 weeks ago at 11:35 p.m. on September 19th.  \n  \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n  \n  \nWeston,  \n  \n  \n  \nI get to meet you tomorrow and I should be sleeping, but I am too excited. Not to mention, your grandparents just got here. I thought I would write you so that later in life you can read this.  \n  \n  \n  \nI never thought my parents understood me. When I got older I realized they understood me much more than I gave them credit for. I spent much of my life looking for the next good time. I have tried to find happiness by keeping all the rules and breaking them. About 11 years ago I stumbled into a church after a life of thinking I knew God. It was then that I really understood that God wanted dependence from me; that He sent Jesus to purchase me with His life. I've looked at the arguments of science and evolution and I understand that the concept of God is quickly growing unpopular. I am, however, certain of Him. He is not just a good idea, He is.  \n  \n  \n  \nI write this, because my biggest prayer for your life is that you would know Him, love Him, and follow Him. Your mother, sisters, and I have prayed for you every day over the past 9 months. They are so excited to meet you and they will want to hold you right away. I will probably have to tell them no, because they might drop you or bounce you around. I don't know what is in store. I am sure that I will disappoint you at times, but please know that I love you. Even before I've met you, I love you. I am committed to working through any differences we might have. I am committed to helping you in any way that I can. I am committed to teaching you things that I know and sharing any learnings that I've come across along the way. I pray that you are wise. I pray that you stand apart from the currents of culture and that you lead and shape culture—conforming it to what God has intended.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou need to know something else too. You have the best mom that anyone could ask for. She is an AMAZING woman and she cares better for her kids than anyone I've ever seen or heard of. You really lucked out! I hope to provide well for you guys, but if anything ever happens to me you need to take care of our family—as the man of the house. We've got some pretty good folks around us, so lean on them too.  \n  \n  \n  \nI am going to try and go to bed now and I will see you in the morning.  \n  \n  \n  \nLove,  \n  \n  \n  \nDad  \n  \n  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \n  \n  \nIt is my joy to minister to young adults and my prayer for them is similar to my prayer for my kids—that they would know God and give their lives to His purpose. Weston was born at 8:25 a.m. on September 20th. I hope the Lord will disciple each of our children through Monica and I and that they in turn would entrust their lives to Him. I pray you and I would do the same.  \n  \n  \n  \nJP"},"url":{"en-US":"letter-to-weston"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/letter-to-weston/"}}},

It was the summer after my junior year in college and I was scheduled to leave for Buenos Aires in 3 weeks to study abroad, celebrate my 21<sup>st</sup> birthday overseas, and finish my degree. I had everything planned out the way I wanted it to go; I would figure out the church thing later—after I got my degree, or after I got a real job, or after I had a family… The point was, not now.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs I returned to Dallas, I told the father-to-be that I was keeping our child and that whether or not he wanted to be a part of that was a decision he needed to make. He promised he would stick it out, and I put my faith in our relationship and that his support would get me through. As we tried to handle the mess we had created, his struggle with alcohol and drug abuse began to dissolve that trust and I realized I was in it alone. I had to do it myself—I didn’t know where else to look.  \n  \n  \n  \n“Stop looking around—look up.” My dad’s words made me realize for the first time that the only place that I could put all of my faith and trust was in the God who created me and chased after my heart as I pursued everything but Him. And slowly but surely, as every other bridge and support in my life crumbled, I realized that while the Bible never promises that trouble won’t come, it does promise that God will be faithful in giving us the endurance to glorify Him in our circumstances.  \n  \n  \n  \nPsalm 119:105 was a passage I read over and over: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” A lamp sheds light on the path immediately at your feet; it doesn’t reveal the obstacles down the road. God gives us the strength to get through each day and I learned to trust that while I didn’t know how I would get through tomorrow, or my pregnancy, or being a single mother, I knew that God would care for me today—and that when tomorrow came, in that day I would be prepared. God used my bad decision to reveal His unfailing love, mercy, and faithfulness in my life.  \n  \n  \n  \nJeremiah 29:11 says: “‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.’” As the proud mother of a three-year-old, I can look back on the road that I’ve walked and know that I never walked alone, and that God always keeps His promises."},"url":{"en-US":"never-walked-alone"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/never-walked-alone/"}}},

Or been prideful about what you’ve done for God, but completely lacking in true love for Him? That describes my early 20s well.  \n  \n  \n  \nI was proud of my “Christian resume”: growing up overseas as a 3<sup>rd</sup> generation missionary kid and pastor’s kid, leading worship regularly, working at a Christian summer camp, barely drinking or smoking, and of course never doing drugs or having sex.  \n  \n  \n  \nBeing externally good was like being on autopilot, but it didn’t bring me peace or joy. I got to a point where I was cold toward the things of God. Worship didn't resonate in my soul, and prayers felt empty. Eventually I got angry at God—why wasn’t it working for me when I knew all the Christian facts and did all the Christian things? Why couldn’t I conjure up the right feelings?  \n  \n  \n  \nI wasn’t really living a Christ-like life, though. I was walking in lust and pride, and had no community or accountability to correct my course. I was placed on a pedestal and introduced to others as “the godliest guy I know”, but didn’t have the courage or humility to share my struggles. In my deepest heart I knew I was walking in sin, but I tried to fix it myself, setting up artificial timelines like pledging not to look at porn after New Year’s (it didn’t work). I was having an affair with self-reliance, and it was killing me.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn the summer of 2005, things finally came to a head. I couldn’t fake it anymore. I couldn’t take being that cold toward God. I was finally honest with God and with myself, and admitted that I didn’t have it all together. I needed Him to do something radical in my heart, and I asked Him to do it.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod showed up! He revealed my sin patterns, selfishness, and sickening pride. As I processed that conviction in prayer, I poured my heart out, unpacking all my junk. In His incredible grace, God spoke three words to me that I will never forget: “I WELCOME THAT”. I broke down and confessed, and for the first time in a long time, felt the burden of performance lifted from me as I rested in Him ([Matthew 11:28-30](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2011:28-30&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \n  \n  \nSince then, I still battle pride and performance regularly, but my approach to life and godliness were radically altered. I understood that while I may be able to control my actions, only God can change my heart ([Ezekiel 11:19](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2011:19&version=NIV1984)). I learned the importance of authenticity, vulnerability, and a total reliance on God’s restorative power ([Psalm 51:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2051:10&version=NIV1984)). I’m walking in consistent community, and one of the main things I ask my brothers to do is watch for my pride.  \n  \n  \n  \nBy God’s grace, now I hope to be one of the first guys, instead of the last one, to tell you that I don’t have it all together, but that I know the One who does!  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What’s your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

Authentic, raw, and honest.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy group couldn’t be more different. Yet, every Wednesday we pull up chairs at Watermark and get cozy.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd, it's another version of \"home.\"  \n  \n  \n  \nDress clothes or sweat pants, sweaty work-out clothes or heels and pencil skirts - we curl up on the couches, laugh, cry, and dig in to the only thing that gets us through our crazy, beautiful weeks.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Word is our mainstay. Our second thing in common.  \n  \n  \n  \nOver the last two years, we've grown in our differences and discovered more similarities - same taste in guys, a love of food, and shared laughter over “F.R.I.E.N.D.S.” Some are no longer with us. Others have joined the crew. Our stagnant stages are met with ferocious opinions to fight harder, grow stronger, be better. But lately we have struggled with one thing: VULNERABILITY.  \n  \n  \n  \nOnly a month ago, my group was ready to quit. Or maybe I should say, I was ready to quit. Conflict, failed commitment, and a heavy emphasis on the social and not spiritual left all of us lacking but silent about our discontent.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, I slowly shut down. I stopped leading well (or at all). I reverted to surface level friendship because it was easier. But, I knew something was deeply wrong. As I prepared what I would say, my heart pounded, and I couldn’t do it. So, I did the only thing I knew could possibly keep me linked to these women: I committed to pray for six weeks.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd pray I did – for peace and direction, for these amazing women, for courage to change what needed to change and peace to let go if the time was right. Finally, I prayed for conviction. FYI, don’t pray for conviction unless you really want it. The Lord answers prayer, and He definitely answered mine.  \n  \n  \n  \nI had forgotten the value of vulnerability. Because of that, I failed to lead well, love well, and grow well with this group. I had also forgotten the value of confession. So, I went back to my group and asked for forgiveness. Talk about humbling. Ironically, it is in those moments of broken honesty and humility that God works the most.  \n  \n  \n  \nBefore I can ever be vulnerable in community I must remember that the Lord loves me for who I am. He knows every hair on my head ([Matthew 10:30](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2010:30&version=NIV1984)), how many times I have messed up, how often I try to please Him, how deeply I love, and how often I try to plan my own way. But growth comes when we allow others to see the victories and the struggles.  \n  \n  \n  \nJust as He loved us, we are called to love others ([1 John 4:11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20john%204:11&version=NIV1984)). And love is honest and real. Community is not packaged people who have it all together. It’s messed up people who struggle and hurt. You won’t always get along. The command isn't to make everyone FEEL better but to encourage one another to BE better. Community is pushing each other when we want to quit and loving one another through it. Your unifying factor is a love for Jesus and a desire to follow Him.  \n  \n  \n  \nThese women influence my life every week, and I'm so thankful! We are called to be vulnerable, open, and honest. Want to know the amazing thing? When we commit to that attitude, it invites others in our group to share.  \n  \n  \n  \nWill you be willing to give of yourself, let people learn from your mistakes and encourage you? Will you drop your pride and admit you aren’t perfect? Will you love people for who they are and allow them to love you the same way? Oh, how we could rock our world, our nation for Jesus if we learned to truly love like this!  \n  \n  \n  \n_“All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.\" Acts 2:44-47_  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat keeps you from being vulnerable in community?

I rolled through them pretty quickly, and some people have asked for a list of them, so here they are.  \n  \n  \n  \n(The figures below come from the Pew Research Center, the Berkeley Research Institute, LifeWay Research, the Barna Group, [_Generation iY_](http://www.amazon.com/Generation-iY-Chance-Their-Future/dp/0578063557) by Tim Elmore, and [_The Millennials_](http://www.amazon.com/The-Millennials-ebook/dp/B004FV4R0O) by Thom Rainer.)  \n  \n  \n  \n[Why Not Me?](http://www.watermark.org/media/why-not-me/2231/)\n\n  \n- In 2012, 80% of people in this life stage believe that they are “very important.” In 1950, only 12% considered themselves to be “very important.”\n  \n- The number one goal of Millennials is to get rich (81%). Their number two goal was to become famous (51%).\n  \n- 96% believe that they will do something great in their lives.\n  \n- 44% said they felt depressed.\n  \n- 10% have considered committing suicide.\n  \n  \nIn other words, our generation is known for being self-centered and narcissistic. This focus on ourselves and our own glory has not led to happiness, though. The right order of things is for us to place others first. As Jesus taught and demonstrated, whoever wants to be greatest must be the greatest servant.  \n  \n  \n  \n[Why Commit?](http://www.watermark.org/media/why-commit/2241/)  \n\n  \n- Today, just 20% of adults aged 18 to 29 are married, compared with 59% in 1960.\n  \n- The overall U.S. adult marriage rate is at an all-time low of 51% (compared with 72% in 1960).\n  \n- 65% cohabitate before marriage.\n  \n- Millennials stay at their jobs for an average of only 2 years, compared to 5 years for Generation X and 7 years for Baby Boomers.\n  \n- 59% of Millennial Christians disconnect from church after age 15, either permanently or for an extended period of time.\n  \n- Each year, one out of seven adults changes his or her church membership. Another one out of six regularly attends a carefully-chosen handful of churches on a rotating basis, rather than sticking with the same church week after week.\n  \n- 75% claim that they are “spiritual but not religious,” meaning that they have no ties to anything other than “spirituality.”\n  \n  \nMillennials are known for either not committing to anything, or not keeping the commitments they do make. The Bible emphasizes that we are to commit in our relationships, our work, and our church, and that we need to keep the commitments we make.  \n  \n  \n  \n[Why Not Tolerance?](http://www.watermark.org/media/why-not-tolerance/2256/)  \n\n  \n- Although 65% classify themselves as Christians, 43% said it does not matter what religious faith you follow because they all teach the same lessons.\n  \n- 68% say that “there is more than one _true_ way to interpret the teachings of my religion.”\n  \n- 50% believe that all people are eventually saved or accepted by God no matter what they do.\n  \n- 61% agree with allowing same-sex marriage.\n  \n- Over 50% of Millennials believe that “what is right and wrong” depends on the situation, and that there are not established “right” and “wrong” actions.\n  \n- 6 out of 10 believe that abortion is acceptable in any circumstance.\n  \n- 4 out of 10 believe that pornography should not be made difficult to access, and believe that it is morally acceptable.\n  \n- 64% believe that sex outside of marriage is morally acceptable.\n  \n  \nOur postmodern society tries to claim that all viewpoints are equally valid, and that we should therefore be \"tolerant\" of every worldview or religion. However, since they each explicitly contradict and exclude each other, it is impossible for more than one way to be true. And if someone is on a destructive path, the truly loving thing to do is to share the truth with them.  \n  \n  \n  \n[Why us?](http://www.watermark.org/media/why-us/2279/)  \n\n  \n- Generation Y is the biggest generation in history, and makes up 1/3 of the world’s current population.\n  \n- 61% of Generation Y feel personally responsible for making a difference in the world.\n  \n- 81% have volunteered in the past year.\n  \n- 77% have “helping others” as one of their chief motivations in life.\n  \n- 87% say that caring for the environment is their responsibility.\n  \n- 79% want to work for a company that cares about how it affects or contributes to society.\n  \n- 60% of Millennials voted in the last presidential election, which is very high for the young adult voting demographic.\n  \n- 65% of adult Millennials have college degrees, making them the single most educated generation ever.\n  \n  \nHere is the positive side of things: today's young adults want to change the world, and they have the ability, availability, and desire to do so. Throughout history, revolutions and revivals have consistently been led by young adults. We are God's \"Plan A\" for accomplishing His purposes in the world, and now is the time to start living that out.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhere do you fall in these statistics?

Or at least, I thought I had escaped: I had no STD, no unwanted children, no prison term, and no physical or mental handicap that I had inflicted on myself. I had a growing bank account, a great career, and got to marry the woman of my dreams. I was getting off _easy!_   \n  \n  \n  \nBut shortly after that special day, I read something that stopped me in my tracks. It scared me. I mean _really_ scared me. This was the kind of fear that could cause a grown man to cry. When is the last time that you cried because you were scared? Now _that's_ fear!  \n  \n  \n  \n**A Scary Story**  \n  \nIt was a [story](http://www.christianitytoday.com/le/topics/soul/temptation/ldlib19-1.html?start=1) of a man who struggled with a sin that he did not acknowledge. The type of sin we've all done. He would rationalize it, and feel that he had it “contained”—not that he had stopped doing it, but that he had it contained within certain limits that he thought were acceptable. He always thought the consequence of his sin was the guilt he felt afterwards.  \n  \n  \n  \nThen, on his way to a conference, he took some vacation time to drive up the New England coast. It was his favorite place in the world, and a drive he had made many times. “Nothing affects me like the long drive up the rocky coastline of Maine,” he wrote. “It is an invigorating, almost religious experience.” It brought him far more joy than his pet sin ever did.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut on this most recent trip, he was shocked to discover that was no longer the case:  \n  \n  \n  \n_I followed my usual practice of staying in homey inns with big fireplaces, and of eating by the waterfront and watching the sailboats bob in the shimmering sea, of taking long solitary walks on the rocky promontories where huge waves crashed with thunder, of closing my eyes and letting salt spray splash across my face, of stopping at roadside stands for fresh lobster and crab. There was a difference this time: I felt no pleasure. None. My emotional reaction was the same as if I had been at home, yawning, reading the newspaper._  \n  \n  \n  \n**Truth and Consequences**  \n  \nSin truly does rob us of life, fooling us into thinking we are living life to the “fullest.” Sin, any sin, turns family into an obligation, turns our relationships into burdensome commitments, and turns friendships into strategic conversations and empty laughter. Sin turns your career into work, turns memories into blurry visions, and turns the beautiful into the ordinary.  \n  \n  \n  \nGo read [Romans 1:18-31](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%201:18-31&version=NIV1984). Notice that the consequence for sin appears to be…more sin. “Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of the hearts…” “Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts…” “Furthermore…he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.” If sin were really just this “guilty pleasure,” then this downward spiral into more and more sin might actually be considered fun. Instead, it is punishment, characterized by futile thinking, darkened hearts, and death. It is the opposite of a full life.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen you think that you truly have escaped the consequences, look at your life deeply. Think about what used to bring you so much joy and now just seems boring. Don’t be fooled into thinking it is experience that changed that. Sin leaves you cold and won’t allow you to realize it until you’re too comfortable being cold to change.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo why do I write something like this? Most of us won't do something unless it affects us for the better, and won't stop doing something unless we know it is going to hurt us. We can be kind of self-centered that way. So let’s make the choice a bit more clear. That repeated sin that you enjoy? It is stealing your joy in life. That guilty pleasure that you manage to get away with? You are not getting away with anything. Avoiding the consequences? You are living the consequences.  \n  \n  \n  \nHey, I am here to say there is hope. Jesus came to set you free from sin and death. And you _can_ ultimately get away with it, in that you can freely have eternal life despite whatever you have done. But there are still consequences in the here and now, and we can't have the full life He desires for us when we are living with the sin He died for.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy prayer for you is that you would find Him more satisfying than that sin you keep returning to. There is a more abundant life found in the freedom Jesus offers. If you don’t believe me, let’s talk.  \n  \n  \n  \nJP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"getting-away-with-it"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/getting-away-with-it/"}}},

Ladies, if you are reading this right now, please stop. Seriously, close this down and go to Pinterest or something, I need to have a conversation with the guys.  \n  \n  \n  \nOkay guys, I'm going to get right to it. I'm challenging you to take Moneywise 1. During the past Moneywise 1 classes, there is one demographic that has been very under-represented: young adult males. Why is this?  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are anything like I was in my 20s and early 30s, it is because (1) you don’t feel like you have any money issues because you haven’t overdrawn your checking account since college or (2) you are afraid I’m going to tell you to stop paying money to join your fantasy football league (don’t worry…I’m not…I pay to be in my league!).  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is important that you all know the consistent feedback we get from those who completed Moneywise 1 is that this is one of those classes that is great \"for everyone, regardless of your current financial situation.\"  \n  \n  \n  \nThe best reason I can think of to take this class in your life stage is this: **you will play how you practice**. You might remember this principle from your old football or basketball coach. The reason they wanted you to go “all out” during practice is because they knew that was a predictor of how you'd play in your upcoming game.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe same principle holds true when it comes to your personal finances. Now, to be very clear, I am **not** saying that as a young adult you are only \"practicing\" the game of life. That is not true—you are in the game now, regardless of your life stage. **What I am saying is that as you get older, you will most likely find yourself in situations where you have been given more and more responsibility.**  \n  \n  \n  \nThis could be in your career, your immediate family, or maybe one day even a family of your own. How you “practice” leading yourself in this area today is a great predictor of how you will handle increased responsibility in the future. Don’t wait until it _feels_ like you have responsibility before you seek to be equipped in this area of life. As Jesus stated in Luke 16:10, “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much…”  \n  \n  \n  \nMoneywise is not a financial crisis ministry. Moneywise seeks to make disciples of Jesus Christ by teaching the basics of financial management and stewardship from a biblical perspective. This class will not waste your time and will help you prepare for what God has next for you.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe next class starts on October 24th and the class will be offered again four times in 2013.

At that point in life, I was not aware that the way that I acted didn’t exactly come naturally for some people. I thought _everyone_ loved the process of making new friends and meeting new people.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, while it is true that I have always enjoyed getting to know people, another thing that I have just recently discovered to be true in my life is that I don’t always allow people to get to know _me_ in the process. I would gladly sit with you all day long and ask you question after question about your passions, desires, dreams, struggles, hurts…and the list goes on. If you turned that around on me, though, I would act like I am the most boring person you could ever ask about.  \n  \n  \n  \nShort, concise answers; sharing just enough to get by without coming across as unfriendly, but not enough to really let you get to know the deepest parts of me. Thus, communicating to you the message from the picture above, “WELCOME!, _but_ ‘No Trespassing’, please!”  \n  \n  \n  \nPossibly a better representation is to bring back the good ol' illustration of

Stipulations that confuse people and, quite honestly, probably leave them wondering why they were attempting to get to know me in the first place! Do this, and you will be accepted to the inside of the “Lindsay Hall Circle of Trust.” Do that, though, and you’re out. And “once you’re out, you’re out. There’s no coming back.”  \n  \n  \n  \nI enjoyed getting to know you, but had fears that I would not really be accepted by you if you knew certain parts of me, fears that I would be betrayed by you, fears that you just simply didn’t find me interesting enough to really care to know me…the list goes on.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat a SAD way to live! Entering into community with people who have expectations of being authentic and vulnerable with one another has revealed this recurring theme in my life and called it what it is: selfishness, fear and pride.  \n  \n  \n  \nSelfishness and self-preservation consumed me. Lindsay Hall Circle of Trust: Member 1 (me).  \n  \n  \n  \nFor so long I was afraid of being shunned, shamed, abandoned, talked about, and judged when, in reality, the greatest acceptance I have ever received has been through making myself vulnerable and being authentic with my community of people around me.  \n  \n  \n  \nSin and lies fester and grow in darkness, but as “children of light,” we are to “have nothing more to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them” (Ephesians 5:8 & 11). Great freedom is found once things we have harbored in shame are exposed into the light!  \n  \n  \n  \nFor so long, I had been confined and chained by keeping things hidden, and I am grateful that the Lord has brought me to a place of recognizing that allowing myself to be vulnerable with others brings liberty.  \n  \n  \n  \nScripture tells us that the Lord uses people in our lives to increase our love and understanding of our need for Him ([Hebrews 10:24-25](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010:24-25&version=NIV1984); [Galatians 6:2](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%206:2&version=NIV1984); [Proverbs 27:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2027:17&version=NIV1984); [James 5:16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%205:16&version=NIV1984)), and it also gives us warnings against living in isolation ([Proverbs 18:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2018:1&version=NIV1984), [Proverbs 28:26](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2028:26&version=NIV1984), [Proverbs 11:14](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2011:14&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \n  \n  \nA (Twitter) friend, Brandon Hatmaker, once said (tweeted): “Community is not the mission. The GOSPEL is the mission. Community is the conduit for the mission.” I love that. I'm so thankful that the Lord chooses to use people in our lives to edify, strengthen and encourage us—ultimately bringing us to know Him more!  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, will you join me as I continue to attempt to strike out fear and take captive my selfish thoughts that say I can do it best on my own? That “outgoing” and “friendly” would not be the goal, but rather that we would really seek to live in authenticity with others, inviting them in—into our lives, into the \"Circle of Trust\"—for the sake of the gospel and the good news that there is freedom from our shame, pride, and selfishness found in community with Christ and with others!  \n  \n  \n  \n_Photo at top courtesy of Creative Commons: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/spike55151/2791252842](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spike55151/2791252842)/_"},"url":{"en-US":"circle-of-trust"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/circle-of-trust/"}}},

I found myself at all the church events during the week as I wanted to absorb everything I could because it felt so new and exciting to walk with Jesus. That meant I was at all the prayer nights, worship events, and Bible studies. But even though I was attending all of those events, I wasn’t really fully known. I felt like I was more coming in and out of a church building but I wasn’t really building relationships. I even remember an older college student pursuing me to see if I was interested in discipleship, but I was nervous about being known and passed up the opportunity.  \n  \n  \n  \nI thought I was only turning down the opportunity to be discipled, but what I really passed up was being fully known, fully loved, and the fellowship and accountability that comes from diving all the way in. So, as soon as the temptations of what the college life had to offer came crouching around the corner, I quickly found myself falling away from my relationship with Jesus and instead found my way back with an old boyfriend, who also happened to be an atheist. I had slipped away and it happened quicker than I would have ever imagined.  \n  \n  \n  \nFrom one day to the next, everything I had been so excited about in getting to know more about Jesus faded away to almost nothing. I would like to say that my worldly living lasted only a moment, but it lasted four years. Those are some of the hardest years to look back on as I caved into believing that what the world had to offer was better than having a relationship with Jesus. As I look back, I realize that my missing link was community. There was no one coming and knocking on my door calling me back. Because I wasn’t fully known, I could slip away from the scene and no one would really notice. It’s easy to be on the sidelines excited about getting to know Jesus but what happens when temptation comes? Who is holding you accountable? The Lord taught me a lot during that time and most of all, He revealed to me how much I needed community. Being a part of a community group now has given me confidence that if I ever had a hint of thinking that the world had something else better to offer, that I would have people coming knocking at my door, loving me enough to speak truth and call me back—back to the giver of life, Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, where are you with community? Are you on the sidelines? Or have you dived all the way in? If you have dived all the way in and are being fully known, I want to encourage you to keep at it. It gets hard sometimes, but it’s worth it. If you are on the sidelines, can I encourage you to plug into a community group at Watermark? Trust me when I tell you that being fully known and fully loved is part of God’s plan for us and He never intended for us to walk this journey with Him alone.  \n  \n  \n  \n_“But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.” - 1 John 1:7_  \n  \n  \n  \nFor help in finding or starting a community group, please contact us at [community@watermark.org](mailto:community@watermark.org).  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n_Artwork is from \"Dublin Doors\" by Amy Taylor, available at [amytaylorart.com](http://www.amytaylorart.com/).

Hard. Frustrating. Scary. Vulnerable. Life-giving. Maturing?  \n  \n  \n  \nI think most people wouldn’t say being in community matures them because I believe that most people are settling for a watered-down version of God’s design for them. We think of living in community as being a part of the bar scene, sitting at Starbucks, or having people to watch the Cowboys with. But, is that really God’s best for us? Living in community is about experiencing authentic relationships that have the gospel at the center, not necessarily ourselves. And the beauty of community is that since we have been accepted by Christ, despite our differences (our sinfulness compared to his perfection), we are able to live in these relationships with people who aren’t exactly like us and accept them as well, exactly as they are.  \n  \n  \n  \nI used to think that being “happy” in a community group was having all the guys be just like me. Because, after all, if we all thought the same, loved the same stuff and laughed at the same jokes then there wouldn’t be any conflict and everything would be great – which in my opinion is what God wants for me. Sound familiar?  \n  \n  \n  \nBut I learned two things by being in a group with guys who aren’t exactly like me: first, I have blind spots. Lot’s of them. I’m prideful and hide behind false humility. I have control issues out the wazoo and am fearful of God stretching my faith. I am able to recognize these blind spots in my life because my guys helped me see them. So it begs the question, “why could they see them when I couldn’t?” Simple, because they are different than me. They are wired differently than me, see the world differently than me, some are more sensitive than me, etc. They helped me see what I couldn’t because we aren’t exactly the same. God uses people who are different than you to shape and transform your spiritual life into one of increasing Christlikeness.  \n  \n  \n  \nSecond, I realized that the gospel changes the way I not only see myself, but how I see other people. My sin separated me from a perfect God to the extent that I had no hope for salvation on my own. But God, being rich in mercy, demonstrated his love for me in that while I was still a sinner, Christ died for me ([Romans 5:8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%205:8&version=NIV1984)). He accepted a pitiful, broken, hopeless sinner because of his Son. I realized that who am I to not accept a fellow brother in Christ who has also been accepted by God? Is my requirements bar higher than God’s? Of course not! That’s ridiculous to even write…but I felt that way at times. The gospel _has transformed_ me into God’s son and _is transforming_ into more of what brings him glory.  \n  \n  \n  \nI can accept those that are different than me because I know that God has accepted me already and that God can use differences in people to sharpen us ([Proverbs 27:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%2027:17&version=NIV1984)).

I love the question \"what difference does it make if I am in community, really?\" because sometimes community can feel perfunctory (I think that is the correct usage)—meaning to perform a function without any good reason or meaning. Well, I decided to look it up just to be sure, and the first synonyms were \"unthinking, automatic, and mechanical.\" So back to the point—perfunctory.  \n  \n  \n  \nCommunity should be anything but unthinking or mechanical. The Lord intended for community to be a part of HIS healing process. [James 5:16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james%205:16&version=NIV1984) says \"confess your sins to one another and pray for each other so that you may be healed.\" Now that particular verse is sandwiched in-between this amazing text about prayer and its power, so we don't want to lose the point there.  \n  \n  \n  \nOn that note, let me detour just for a moment. That passage actually says that Elijah is a man just like you and me! He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and guess what? It DID NOT RAIN for three-and-a-half years! WHOA! And he prayed again. This time it says that, \"the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.\"  \n  \n  \n  \nSo the point is, we—or better said,YOU—like Elijah, have the power to impact people and events here on this earth. God, for whatever reason, has written you and me into the fabric of each others' healing and growth. He says to confess your sins to one another and pray for each other so that you may be healed. I know this is true because the Scriptures tell me, but I also know this is true because it wasn't until I got into community over 10 years ago that the chains of slavery began to fall off. I had been walking with the Lord closely for about eight years, but the addiction to a focus on food and body image didn't loosen its hold on me until...do you want to guess? Yes, until I got into community.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor years I remember asking the Lord to heal me and free me. I would say, \"Lord I know you can, I just don't know why you aren't.\" Come to find out, He didn't intend for me to find freedom from slavery ON MY OWN! He wanted me to begin to share my life and struggles with others. As I began to share my thoughts and behaviors, the Lord used His people to be His hands and feet. For the first time, I felt more fully loved because I felt more fully known. In that process the Lord used His Spirit, His Word, and these women to bring freedom and transformation that I couldn't find on my own.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, to my question: What difference does it really make if you are in community? It depends on what you want out of life. If you want to live your life by the motto \"that's none of anyone's business\" and end up as a slave to your pet sins (food obsession, pornography, your appearance, or finding security in changing your marital status), then you can feel free to stay put if you aren't sharing your life with others. But if you want to begin to enjoy the fresh air and satisfaction of a life that _is_ experiencing God's presence more fully because you aren't a slave to your desires, then knowing and being known by people really does make a difference."},"url":{"en-US":"what-difference-does-it-make-if-im-in-community-really"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-difference-does-it-make-if-im-in-community-really/"}}},

But spend just a little bit of time there interacting with people, and you realize that Haiti and Dallas have more in common than you might think. The circumstances are different; the average Haitian makes about $2 a day, which I suppose makes them poorer financially than even the average homeless person here. But people are people wherever you go, and the core struggles of our lives are essentially the same.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor example, it is commonly said that Haiti is 80% Catholic, 20% Protestant, and 100% Voodoo. They believe in God, but they believe He is slow. So they turn to Voodoo (or “[Vodou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Vodou)”), which is basically calling on the power of evil spirits, as a shortcut to try to get what they want.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow is that at all like Dallas? Well, if you were to ask Haitians about Dallas, they would probably say that the people here are 80% Protestant, 20% Catholic, and 100% materialistic. That we believe in God, but we believe He is slow. So we turn to the power of our resources or use other people as a shortcut to get what we want. We don’t wait for marriage. [We don’t commit](http://www.watermark.org/media/why-commit/2241/) to sticking things out long-term. Our money gives us access to alcohol, or pornography, or designer clothes, or whatever else we think can satisfy us and make us happy. Of course, the problem with these shortcuts is that in the long run they _have never, ever, made anyone happy_.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo is God slow? In one aspect, actually, God _is_ slow. The Bible is very clear about that. The Scriptures say that God is slow—_to anger_. The phrase that God is “slow to anger” occurs in the Bible [at least 9 times](http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=slow+to+anger&searchtype=all&version1=102&language1=en&spanbegin=1&spanend=73). Another way of saying “slow to anger” would be “patient.” God is patient with us when He could rightfully be angry. This patience is the focus of another “slow” verse, 2 Peter 3:9:  \n  \n  \n  \n_The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance._  \n  \n   \n  \nThe Lord is NOT slow. But He is patient, which means we have to exist in a broken world at least a bit longer. Two thoughts to keep in mind in the meantime:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Life is short, but eternity is really, really long.**  \n  \n  \n  \n_I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. – Romans 8:18_  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. The shortcuts we try to take are often the very _cause_ of our unhappiness.**  \n  \n  \n  \nThat is why Satan is called “the father of lies” (John 8:44).  \n  \n  \n  \n_The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. – John 10:10_  \n  \n  \n  \nLook to God for life. Don’t fall for the Dallas Voodoo.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen God seems slow to give you what you want, what do you turn to?

If God really loved him, why didn’t God give him those things?  \n  \n  \n  \nBecause he was in Haiti, and the conditions there are so poor, that might seem like a fair question. But what would it take for God to be considered good?  \n  \n  \n  \n**What is “Good”?**  \n  \nFor example, let’s say that this same guy lived in America, did have a job and at least some money, but was still single. Now would you say that God’s been good? Or what if you got everything you ever wanted—for a while—but then lost it. Lost that perfect job, for instance, or had your dream home burn down.

Does God not at least get credit for that?  \n  \n  \n  \n**When Bad Things Happen**  \n  \nOK, so this is all a matter of degrees. What about the truly bad things that happen?

They rushed the father and daughter to the nearest clinic, which was 30 or 40 miles away, only to find out that the clinic was closed. At that moment, they heard the baby girl take her last breath, and die. They later determined that the girl died of starvation, and that the family had no food because they had given everything they owned to a Voodoo priest.  \n  \n  \n  \nNow that’s _really_ bad. How could a good God allow a 1-year-old to starve to death? The Bible says that “in all things God works for the good of those who love him,who have been called according to his purpose” (Romans 8:28). So how could that possibly be for good, or have any purpose?  \n  \n  \n  \nCertainly, that is the kind of thing you don’t just walk away and forget. The American couple couldn’t forget. They had to do something about it. So they quit their jobs, left everything they had, and moved to Haiti to devote the rest of their lives to mission work. And the result of that move, now 15 years later?\n\n  \n- 200 patients a day get the medical care that the little girl could not.\n  \n- 3,000 kids are getting a proper education in a country with no school system.\n  \n- 50,000 meals are given out to children around the country each day.\n  \n- 500 homeless families have new homes.\n  \n- More than 60 abandoned orphans have a place to live, where they are cared for.\n  \n- The parents who lost their child because of Voodoo now believe and follow Christ.\n  \n  \nSo, though we might not always see it from our limited perspective, God can and does turn even tragedies into a greater good.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Infinitely Good**  \n  \nI understand that some would say a good God would not allow pain at all. Of course, a good and loving God would have to allow free will, because without the freedom to choose He would just be creating robots, or slaves. And the freedom to choose necessarily means freedom to make bad choices, which lead to pain. But an all-powerful and fully good God could surely figure out some way to fix that, right? If He was perfectly and infinitely good, He would somehow take that pain on Himself, or sacrifice Himself to take on the consequences of people’s bad choices. And He would create a true paradise where people live forever, and there is no death, no pain, and no tears.  \n  \n  \n  \nWait, [that sounds familiar…](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:1-5&version=NIV1984)  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat do you think? Is God good? How have you seen Him take what seemed to be bad and used it to accomplish a greater good?  \n  \n  \n  \nJP"},"url":{"en-US":"is-god-good"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/is-god-good/"}}},

It is one of the defining characteristics of [Generation Y](http://theporch.wpengine.com/generation-why-statistics/). Almost all (96%) of this generation believe that they will do “something great” with their lives, and a majority feel personally responsible for making a difference in the world.  \n  \n  \n  \nSome might argue that this is a flaw—that young adults have too high an opinion of themselves for thinking that they, or that any single person, could change the world.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut I believe that it is possible. One person—or, at least, a small group of people—can change the world. And history backs me up on that.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe best example of this is Jesus. Of course, though Jesus was a man, He was also God. But the men and women who followed Him? They were nothing special. They were not powerful, not well-connected, and honestly not all that smart ([Matthew 15:16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2015:16&version=NIV1984)). But it was this small group of people, following the example of Jesus, who changed the world to such an extent that the calendar of history reset.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo how do you change the world? The process can be broken down into 3 steps:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Be changed.**  \n  \nBefore you can cause change, you have to be changed yourself. Change follows change. You have to be different.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’m not sure that anyone can really change themselves, though; there has to be some outside catalyst. The catalyst for real, positive, lasting change is Jesus and the power of the gospel. Even non-Christian organizations that exist to help people change their lives say that you must call on a “higher power.” They are afraid to even use the word “God,” but they admit that your life cannot be changed without Him working in you.  \n  \n  \n  \nOne of the biggest reasons why the apostle Paul had such a huge impact is because people could see that he had been hugely changed. The #1 persecutor of Christians was now the #1 evangelist, willing to suffer persecution himself because he knew firsthand the truth about Jesus. If you think that your past somehow makes you unworthy of being a leader, think again; it can actually make you more effective.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Invest deeply into a small number of people.**  \n  \nOne person can change the world—but you can’t do it by yourself.  \n  \n  \n  \nThere is the danger, however, of thinking that the key is to mass-broadcast and personally convince the entire world to change. That doesn’t work, unless you happen to be Oprah—and even then, it would only work with some really minor change. Getting someone to really change, in a big way, requires time and a personal connection.  \n  \n  \n  \nJesus preached to many thousands of people, but invested deeply and personally into only 12. Most all of those thousands of people left Him ([John 6:66](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206:66&version=NIV1984)), or even turned on Him in the end. But the 12 (or, actually, just 11 of the 12) followed Him and truly knew Him. After Jesus left, they were the ones who continued His work and eventually changed the lives of billions. How? Why? Because of the third thing Jesus did, which is:  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Encourage those few people to repeat the process with others.**  \n  \nYou can only change a few people by your example, but those few can then also do the same with a few others. And those few others can do the same with a few others. And so on and so on…  \n  \n  \n  \nLet’s say you invest deeply into just 2 people for a full year. They observe how you do things, and you teach them everything that you have learned. You basically replicate yourself, or at least replicate the positive change that you want to see in the world.  \n  \n  \n  \nAt the end of that year, you encourage each of them to go out and do exactly the same thing by discipling 2 others, while you again start discipling another 2 yourself.  \n  \n  \n  \nCan that really make a difference? And will you be able to see that difference in your lifetime? Let’s look at the math:\n\n  \n- After 2 years, there would only be 9 people changed—yourself, the 2 you discipled the first year, and the 6 people that you and your 2 friends discipled the second year.\n  \n- The next year those 9 people would add 18 more, for a total of 27.\n  \n- After 5 years, there would be a total of 243 people changed.\n  \n- In 10 years, the number would be just over 59,000.\n  \n- In 20 years, you will reach almost 3.5 billion.\n  \n- And sometime in the 21<sup>st</sup> year—the year 2033, if you start today—you will have reached every single person on the planet.\n  \n  \nWorld changed.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo what are you waiting for?  \n  \n  \n  \nJP"},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-change-the-world"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-change-the-world/"}}},

And, as Uncle Ben\\* would say, “With great power comes great responsibility.”  \n  \n  \n  \nSo how do Christians responsibly use the power of social media? Luckily, there is a book that answers that question for us. It’s called the Bible.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Bible and Social Media**  \n  \nHow can a book written millennia before the internet even existed have anything to say about social media?  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Bible actually has a lot to say on the subject, because it talks extensively about how we are to communicate and relate to people. Try looking up the word “tongue” for starters; it occurs [137 times](http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?search=tongue&version1=NIV1984&searchtype=all&limit=none&wholewordsonly=no) in the Bible, and almost all of them have to do with speaking. For example:  \n  \n\n\n  \n- _When words are many, sin is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is wise. – Proverbs 10:19_\n  \n- _A man of knowledge uses words with restraint...Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tongue. – Proverbs 17:27-28_\n  \n- _He who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself from calamity. – Proverbs 21:23_\n  \n  \n And there are many other verses that likewise have reminded me, at various times, to shut up.  \n  \n  \n  \n**A Time to Speak**  \n  \nBut that is clearly not the whole story. We are also called to tell the good news ([Romans 10:14-15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:14-15&version=NIV1984)), to demolish arguments ([2 Corinthians 10:5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2010:5&version=NIV1984)), and to speak the truth in love ([Ephesians 4:15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:15&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \n  \n\n  \n- _Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. **<sup> </sup>** Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy. – Proverbs 31:8-9_\n  \n- _The first to present his case seems right, till another comes forward and questions him. – Proverbs 18:17_\n  \n- _Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone. – Colossians 4:5-6_\n  \n  \nSo we are to make the most of the opportunity we have online—which means we should [say something](http://theporch.wpengine.com/evangelism-works-vs-words/)—but we have to be careful what we say.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Social Media Tips**  \n  \nLet’s get practical. Here are some specific tips for how to use social media for Jesus:  \n  \n  \n\n  \n- **Be intentional.** Saying something on social media is roughly the equivalent of standing up and announcing it to a room of 500 people. Now, maybe you really would announce to such a crowd that “These Dorito tacos are amazing!” After all, they are pretty good. But don’t neglect the power of that platform to also say something truly important. (“This Jesus is amazing!”)\n  \n- **Be clear.** As much as 90% of face-to-face communication is nonverbal, conveyed through body language or tone of voice. You lose all of that online (unless you are posting a video). To make sure you are not misunderstood, think before you type ([James 1:19](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:19&version=NIV1984)).\n  \n- **Watch your language.** Your non-believing friends might not get the message if you speak in Christianese. \n  \n- **Don’t argue in the comments section.** It just doesn’t seem to do any good. Online arguments rarely ever cause anyone to change their position, and they tend to be much less civil than if the same people were having the same discussion in person. ([2 Timothy 2:23-25](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:23-25&version=NIV1984))\n  \n- **Connect with people personally.** Most social media posts are broadcast to no one in particular. A personal, one-on-one message or conversation is much more powerful.\n  \n- **Be a true friend.** Sometimes people share very personal things, or red flags, on social websites. This is a chance for you to reach out personally and show the love of Christ ([John 13:34-35](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2013:34-35&version=NIV1984)).\n  \n- **Live it out.** None of this should be that much different than what you are doing offline. And social media makes our lives today very public; if what you say doesn’t match up with what you do, people will see right through it (and have the pictures to prove it). It is not about using social media to present your life in a favorable light, but rather living your life in a light-filled way ([Ephesians 5:8-16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:8-16&version=NIV1984)).\n  \n  \nWhat have you found that works (or does not work) on social media?

The result will be a long list of thanks to God, and a testament to His goodness.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’ll start. Some things I am thankful for:  \n  \n\n\n  \n- God's amazing grace in my marriage. It was once dead. I was once clueless. I did not marry a [Proverbs 31](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2031&version=NIV1984) woman, but she became one as I learned to lead her according to the Scriptures. Now she is the holiest woman I know. She sets the bar in our house for what it means to sit with Jesus.\n  \n- The health of our children. Even though this has been a very difficult season with Weston and his many digestion problems (acid reflux, milk allergy, etc.), [God is still good](http://theporch.wpengine.com/is-god-good/). We are tired, but we love our God, and are thankful for this incredible gift in Weston.\n  \n- The health of our ministry. I could be doing ministry where it is illegal to worship God and persecution is a real threat. Instead, I get to lead others in serving Him, and have a blast doing so. He could have me in a season where we would sow and not see the fruit, but instead we are seeing young adults trade in the Dallas lifestyle for Jesus every week. They are winning, and we are watching. It is awesome!!!\n  \n- God flexing. God has saved my best friend and recently blessed him with a child. God has saved the marriages of many people I love. I have watched Him do the impossible with ease, and I am grateful. Beyond grateful.\n  \n  \nWhat are you thankful for?

Through it, and more despite us than because of us, [people are finding](http://theporch.wpengine.com/category/our-stories/) real life, freedom, forgiveness, and purpose.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Who goes to The Porch at Watermark?**  \n  \nDallas twenty-somethings and thirty-somethings, including: uptown girls, country boys, alcoholics, drug dealers, porn addicts, single parents, abortionists, adulterers, perfectionists, atheists, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, legalistic Christians, hypocrites, homosexuals, the suicidally depressed, party animals, geeks, freaks, and sinners. At least, that is what we once were; now, we are new. But enough about our leadership team.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How many people attend Watermark The Porch?**  \n  \nOn an average Tuesday, around 1,500 to 2,000. Not everyone attends every week, so there are probably twice that many Porch-goers overall.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Childcare The Porch Watermark Dallas**  \n  \nChildcare is provided for anyone from 8 weeks to 12 years old. It is located on the first floor of the tower. Anyone at the welcome center or any Porch volunteer should be able to show you where it is located.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Letter to the President from Weston**  \n  \n[Weston](http://theporch.wpengine.com/letter-to-weston/) is something like 2 months old. I’m sure he is exceedingly smart, but I don’t think he is advising on foreign policy or budget decisions quite yet.  \n  \n  \n  \nOn second thought, maybe he is. It would explain some things.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Matt Chandler in Spanish**  \n  \n“[Mateo Cerero](http://translate.google.com/#es/en/Mateo%20Cerero).”  \n  \n  \n  \n**Do guys want to DTR?**  \n  \nThough some might be afraid to have that conversation, most guys dislike ambiguity and do want to know where they stand.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Kiss but no DTR**  \n  \nI think that the kiss itself counts as a DTR, unless he normally kisses people he is just friends with.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Kiss another guy before DTR**  \n  \nI think that also defines the relationship, but in a much different way.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Can I tell him I like him without DTR?**  \n  \nI think you are looking at DTR too much as an event. DTR simply means “define the relationship.” It doesn’t have to be a specific, scheduled sit-down talk. Just be clear and honest in your intentions and feelings, and don’t play games.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Guys aren’t asking girls out**  \n  \nWant to grab coffee sometime?  \n  \n  \n  \n **“Coffee sometime” leads to sex**  \n  \nOh, wait…it does? Must be good coffee.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Premarital sex is a sin**  \n  \n[Yes, it is](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/). And you won’t regret waiting until after marriage to have coffee sometime.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Premarital sex not sin**  \n  \nThe person above would seem to disagree.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Is porn considered adultery?**  \n  \n[According to Jesus](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:28&version=NIV1984), yes.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Can I be forgiven from God for adultery and homosexual acts?**   \n  \nAbsolutely! God can handle your issues. He is not surprised, and does not love you less because of it. He sent His Son to die for it, and the death penalty is enough to pay the price for any wrong. The penalty has already been paid; you just need to accept and trust in that forgiveness.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why do guys take girls out on dates if they aren’t ready to be serious?**  \n  \nIf someone is dating but is not looking for a serious relationship, they must be looking for something else instead. Namely: “coffee sometime.” Hold out for something better.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Dating a new guy, should I be honest with him?**  \n  \nYes. And avoid coffee.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How to be honest if you are dating someone else**  \n  \nTry this: “I’m dating someone else.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**How can I stand here and let the person I like date someone else**  \n  \nOh, I’m sorry to hear that. I know that can be really tough. But you are going to have to move on, and eventually sit down. It may be hard to believe at times, but God does have something better planned for you.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Church shopping how to do it**  \n  \nHave you seen the Black Friday crowds at Baptists “R” Us? I would recommend [church-committing](http://www.watermark.org/media/why-commit/2241/) instead. It’s cheaper.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Do red heelers chase cars?**  \n  \nYes. Red cars.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How to stop a car from chasing you down the driveway**  \n  \nWait—a _car_ is chasing _you_ down the driveway? Right now?  \n  \n  \n  \n**How to lead worship at The Porch**  \n  \nWell, next week (December 11) is the last time we will meet in 2012 before breaking for Christmas. [Patrick Ryan Clark](http://www.patrickryanclark.com/) will be leading worship that Tuesday.  \n  \n  \n  \nTo lead worship in 2013, the main requirement is that your first name needs to be either “Shane,” or “Shane.” That’s because [Shane & Shane](http://shaneandshane.com/) have been announced as the new worship leaders at The Porch! Get excited!  \n  \n  \n  \nOh, but that means you are probably out of luck. Sorry about that. We could always let you play in the lobby, or something.  \n  \n  \n  \n- Kevin\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"what-you-are-looking-for-3rd-edition"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-you-are-looking-for-3rd-edition/"}}},

The Mayans never predicted that December 21, 2012 would be the end of the world; they just made a calendar that only had a set number of digits. Their calendar no more predicts that the world will end than a clock face predicts the end of time at 12 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out, but just in case, the folks at NASA have [released a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY_Gc1bF8ds), intended for December 22, entitled “Why the World Didn’t End Yesterday.” Of course, if they are wrong, no one would be around that day to watch it and laugh at them, so it is not like they are sticking their necks out on the issue.  \n  \n  \n  \nI agree that the world will not end on Friday, 12/21/12. However, the world _will end_ someday. There is really no argument on that point; _everyone_ agrees that the world does have an expiration date. The only debate is how and when it will end, and what that means for us.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why the World Won’t End on December 21, 2012**  \n  \nThe Bible gives quite a bit of detail about the end of the world, especially in Revelation. I won’t get into all of the details here because you can learn everything you ever wanted to know about Revelation through [this podcast series](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/264/). There is some debate about the exact order of events, but all Bible scholars would agree that the world won’t end before Jesus comes back.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen talking about His return, Jesus says (in Matthew 24:36) that “No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” Eight verses later, He says that “the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.”  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, any time someone claims to know when the end will come, you can rest assured that they don’t actually know. Jesus said that _no one knows_ when He is coming; even He doesn’t know. And if they predict a specific time, that time is guaranteed to be wrong. That’s because the prediction itself causes people to expect it, when Jesus said it would be a time when you do _not_ expect it.  \n  \n  \n  \nBecause of that, I think it is fairly safe to say that December 21 can be ruled out as the date of Jesus’ return. However, that doesn’t mean He couldn’t come back the day after that. Or the day before. Or even _right now_.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Resurrection Preppers**  \n  \nStill here? OK, we can’t know exactly when the end will come, but we do know that it is “soon.” And it is getting closer all of the time. So what should you do about it?\n\n  \n- Be ready. Are you certain of where you would end up if Jesus came back today? If you don’t believe in Jesus at all, are you absolutely certain that you are right? This is _the_ question, the biggest question you will ever face in life. Do whatever it takes to make sure you get it right, and get it right _soon_. I’d be happy to answer your questions about it right now.\n  \n- Be diligent. If Jesus were to show up right now, would you be excited or embarrassed? Relieved that your work was done, or regretful that you [could have saved one more](http://www.wingclips.com/movie-clips/schindlers-list/one-more-person)? Though we cannot earn salvation by being “good enough,” Jesus also talks extensively about making good use of the talents and time He has given us. “It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes.” (Matthew 18:37a)\n  \n- Be patient. When [tragedy happens](http://theporch.wpengine.com/does-god-understand-tragedy/), we may rightly wish that Jesus would come back already. But [God is not slow](http://theporch.wpengine.com/is-god-slow/); He is allowing more time for His workers (you and I) to plant seeds and share in the harvest. “See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near.” (James 5:7-8).\n  \n  \n**The End is Near**  \n  \nIn the end, the timing of the end doesn’t really matter. The ancient Mayans are not around to see what happens on Friday, because they died long ago. Likewise, each of us will soon enough face our own end, regardless of what happens with the rest of the world. Your own expiration date is just as unpredictable and just as certain, and I guarantee you’ll live just long enough to see it.  \n  \n  \n  \nAre you ready?  \n  \n  \n  \nJP"},"url":{"en-US":"its-the-end-of-the-world-and-i-feel-fine"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/its-the-end-of-the-world-and-i-feel-fine/"}}},

The reality of that truth hit me about a year ago when a medical professional advised me to \"get some work done.\" That well-intended bit of advice joined the choir of voices that sings a deafening me-centered anthem each day.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut it's not all about me. God did not give me the resources He did so that I would squander them on trying to avoid reality. The years, the wisdom, and the experience of God's faithfulness that has remained constant for my entire life are all beautiful gifts. My community group reminds me of that truth as they speak from God's Word and from their own years of experience. Without their loving, yet uncomfortable correction, I am tempted to hide the truth—especially as I am often the oldest person in the room at my job and as I serve at The Porch. When I live in reality and remember my true value and identity is found in Christ and not in my beauty or youth, I am free to love and serve rather than keep up a protective facade.  \n  \n  \n  \n**I place a higher value on tasks than on people.**  \n  \n  \n  \nI was reminded of this just last week. I was passionately presenting my opinion on a ministry decision. While my words said, \"I don't have a problem with you, I just feel strongly about the issue,\" I was forced to stop in my tracks as a battered and bruised friend was literally backed on his heels. He bravely and humbly revealed that my words hurt. I was more concerned with getting my point across and pressing the issue than loving my friend. Without his value for community, his willingness to inflict \"wounds from a friend,\" ([Proverbs 27:6](https://www.youversion.com/bible/112/pro.27.6.niv84)) I would continue on believing that I was \"right\"—alienating those I care about and destroying valuable working relationships.  \n  \n  \n  \n**I avoid vulnerability.**  \n  \n  \n  \nI am quick to speak factually and state opinions, but I find it very hard to show others how I feel.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor years I had many acquaintances, but no true friends that I trusted so much that I would be willing to bare my soul to them. I was lonely. I felt isolated in the crowd as my friends chose to spend more time with those who let them \"in.\" With all the blessings of community, the truth is that there really is no community where there is no vulnerability. When there is no vulnerability, I am not known, I am not free to be myself—I am not experiencing God's love.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf I face reality alone, I am in a place of despair. But in the context of community, I am facing reality with hope as I experience joy and depth in relationship with others as well as in my relationship with God. I have grown more than I thought was possible. Even the fact that I have listed these things about myself shows how I've grown in being vulnerable! I still have a long way to go, but I can rest in the security of knowing that God has provided dear friends to lovingly show me areas of my life where I am deceiving myself and believing lies, blind spots that I would never discover on my own, and opportunities to step out in faith that I would not take advantage of without their encouraging support.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Friend, you are depraved.**  \n  \n  \n  \nWhile you won't find that in a greeting card, it is the truth. The fact is that that I am, too. We all are. Denying that truth puts us on a path to death and destruction. There is no way to experience life, freedom, and abundance while living in denial. The truth sets us free ([John 8:32](https://www.youversion.com/bible/112/jhn.8.32.niv84)), but that freedom is only found in the context of community.  \n  \n  \n  \nEphesians 4:14-15 states: \"Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ.\"  \n  \n  \n  \nDo you see the result if we don't have people around us who are willing to lovingly speak truth into our lives? We will stay immature. Life will be tumultuous as we experience a reality-vertigo. We will be susceptible to lies. We will think we can do it on our own. That is just not true. No one has become mature with Christ-like character outside of community. God created us to be part of His body. It is His provision and His process for us.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt can feel scary, but I have never regretted facing my friend, reality, as long as all of the grace, love, and security that God provides through community is surrounding me as well."},"url":{"en-US":"reality-is-your-friend-unless-its-your-only-friend"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/reality-is-your-friend-unless-its-your-only-friend/"}}},

It was my 24<sup>th</sup> birthday and I had been arrested for a DWI after overdosing on many drugs. At the time, I believed in a God but did not have a personal relationship with Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Abusing and Using**  \n  \nGrowing up in Plano, I had a fairly normal life and a “good” childhood. But, at the age of six, I was sexually abused by a neighbor. I also didn't have any real relationship with my father; we never spoke with each other, because he believed a dad's role was to make money and provide for the family while the wife stayed home and took care of the kids. These two things in a boy’s life can be very damaging; they had a huge negative impact on how I viewed the world and how I viewed God. I tried to isolate myself from it all, and felt that my heart was filled with darkness.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn high school, I started smoking weed to escape reality as an answer to my problems. Though it started small, that eventually led to me selling weed, and then abusing cocaine, alcohol, and pills. I also started to sell cocaine and steal in order to support my habits.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’ve searched for life in drugs, alcohol, lying, cheating, stealing, sexual immorality, materialism, and wealth. I can tell you now, looking back on my life and the decisions I have made, that none of these things can ever bring lasting joy and satisfaction in life.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Light in the Darkness**  \n  \nA year ago, I came to Watermark to check out The Porch. A guy wearing a Porch volunteer T-shirt started talking to me after the service. He asked me, “If you died tonight, on a scale of 1 to 10, how sure are you that you would go to heaven?” I said an “8” because I grew up going to church, and was hoping he would leave me alone. I thought these people were strange, always talking about Jesus, but I continued to come to The Porch and that same guy kept talking to me every week. That one guy, through God, helped change my life.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe first night I attended The Porch, [JP shared a story about an orphan girl](http://www.watermark.org/media/chosen-by-god/2067/) in Asia who had all kinds of diseases and was living in an orphanage. When a couple came to visit her, she spat in their faces, but the man wanted to adopt her anyway. We often spit in God’s face, turning away from His unfailing love and grace. He loves us regardless of what we’ve been through, any secret sin we are hiding, and all our shortcomings. He loves us more than any human could ever love us. This story cut through the wall I had built around my heart, and I kept coming every Tuesday. Later I attended [Launch](http://theporch.wpengine.com/launch-2012-in-photos/), a singles retreat, where everything clicked. My life changed that weekend and I fell in love with Jesus, embracing Matthew 6:33:  \n  \n  \n  \n_But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well._  \n  \n  \n  \nThe community I have found through The Porch and Watermark has been a blessing in my life. Not long ago, a couple of friends from Watermark threw a “one year free from cocaine” party for me. Though I have not known them long, I can see the intense love of Christ through them.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. – Lamentations 3:22-23_  \n  \n  \n  \nI know that God loves me in spite of anything I've done, and freely gives life that I could never earn. His light pierced the darkness in my heart. Now I live to tell people there is hope in their life, no matter where they are, and that God loves them and has a future for them.  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

I've noticed that Christmas movies are all about love, relationships, and family. Christmas songs have become about \"Santa Baby\" and \"All I Want for Christmas is You.\" Conversations about Christmas have turned into questions about what you are buying the loved ones in your life, or how you can fit everything into your schedule. In many ways Christmas has turned into as much of a \"Single Awareness Day\" as Valentine’s Day. Going to Christmas parties and feeling like \"if only I had a date this year,\" or being with your family and feeling like the only person who doesn't have someone special to exchange a gift with...  \n  \n  \n  \nThe truth is, not having a relationship during Christmas does suck—if you do not have a relationship with the birthday boy we are celebrating.

The death of a child is tragic in any circumstance.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, I cannot even imagine what it would be like to watch a beloved child be slowly and publicly tortured to death. Not only publically in that moment, but in a way that would be memorialized and celebrated throughout history in one of the most well-known events of the world.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod needs no reminders of His Son’s death, but if He did, He would not have to look far. He could simply look for a steeple, and if there was not a memorial of the death of Jesus topping it, then He could go inside the building and most likely find a statue of the event. His Son, on an instrument of torture, marked with gashes, blood, thorns, and nails, dying in excruciating pain.  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, I don’t believe that Jesus on a cross is the most tragic part of the crucifixion.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe reason His Son died was tragic. Jesus died because the people God loved had left Him. Tragic. Jesus died as a payment to purchase them back. We deserved an eternal death for running from an eternal God, so a perfect eternal God suffered and died as a human to pay the penalty on our behalf.  \n  \n  \n  \nYet, the reason for Jesus’ death is not the greatest tragedy of the cross.  \n  \n  \n  \nToday, we forget that God knows tragedy intimately. We see a dead Jesus, but forget what He represents: the Father watching His Son endure the sins of the world, slowly suffering, and dying in public humiliation.  \n  \n  \n  \nI believe our forgetting, or forsaking that sacrifice, is the greatest tragedy of the event. The cross bleeds a forgiveness so strong that it can forgive murderers; even murderers of children, should they seek it. For some of us, that makes us angry. Not because we see that particular sin as so big, but because we don’t see that our own sin against an almighty, perfect God is a big deal. And if our sin isn’t a big deal, then grace is not a big deal. As a result, we don’t really appreciate how big and amazing His grace really is.  \n  \n  \n  \nTragic events can seem impossible to understand, and are certainly too difficult to endure alone. The enemy wants to use these events to push us away from God, when a right response is the exact opposite: to lean into a personal God who can relate. God understands tragedy: the death of His Son, the rejection by those He loved that caused it, and the tragic betrayal of those He died for who don't care.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod knows tragedy, and He pursues us in and through it.  \n  \n  \n  \nJP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"does-god-understand-tragedy"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/does-god-understand-tragedy/"}}},

He was fair, pointing out that the problem was not limited to [Generation Y](http://theporch.wpengine.com/generation-why-statistics/), and definitely was not caused by that generation.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe problem that was mentioned was that Generation Y has been instructed to “follow your passion.” A [Harvard Business Review blog post](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/09/solving_gen_ys_passion_problem.html) pointed out that the phrase “follow your passion,” which hardly ever appeared in written works before 1990, has since then increased exponentially—which means it became a common refrain during the time that most of us were getting an education and making decisions about our direction in life. However, as both Todd and the blog writer pointed out, “follow your passion” is not very good advice.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Don’t Follow Your Passions?**  \n  \nA big problem with using “follow your passion” as a guiding light is that our passions can often lead us to bad places.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor example, following passions is often at odds with [commitment](http://www.watermark.org/media/why-commit/2241/). It implies that, if you are not in love with and passionate about your job, you should change careers—even though _most_ jobs are less fun at first, and become more satisfying as you become better at them and move beyond the entry level. It is probably an even bigger problem in relationships; isn’t infidelity and divorce all about passions versus commitment?  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Bible does warn about how passion can lead us astray, and how the desires of our hearts cannot always be trusted. Jeremiah 17:9, for instance, says that “The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?” And nowhere does the Bible say to follow your passion; rather, it says to follow God. In the Gospels, Jesus is quoted 20 different times saying the same two words: “Follow Me.”  \n  \n   \n  \n**Fulfill Your Passions**  \n  \nIt must be true that “follow your passion” is ingrained in our generation, though, because I still find myself rebelling against the notion that this is _not_ good advice. Follow Jesus but don’t follow your passion; does that mean Christians don’t get to do what they want? That our jobs, or whatever we do each day, should not be enjoyable or satisfying?  \n  \n  \n  \nThat is what I wanted to clarify: following God is the only thing that truly brings satisfaction. Following God allows you to _fulfill_ your passions.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe are each wired different ways—by design. We have deep-seated desires in our hearts—by design. God has a purpose for you, and you won’t be fully satisfied or fully successful until you are fulfilling that purpose. It is literally what you were born to do.  \n  \n  \n  \n_For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. – Ephesians 2:10_  \n  \n   \n  \nThe problem is that we often try to fulfill those desires in the wrong way. We search for significance in earning and showing off wealth, or we compromise our values to experience the fleeting, feeling kind of \"love\". We use people to get what our passions say we should have. We may experience temporary highs for a moment, but they are followed by long-term pain and/or chronic dissatisfaction.  \n  \n  \n  \nPsalm 37:4: “Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart”—the true desires of your heart. I pray that He gives you a passion for Him and that we take great joy in pursuing Him above, beyond, and in everything else.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow have you struggled or grown through pursuing your passions?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"dont-follow-your-passions"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/dont-follow-your-passions/"}}},

Leslie was kind enough to sit down this week and answer some questions for The Porch in advance of their performance.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why the name “All Sons & Daughters”?**  \n  \nWe are worship leaders at our church so we thought it was not only a play on the \"guy/girl\" thing, but also a really great way to keep things inclusive. We want everyone (especially our church) to feel like they are a part of this journey with us!  \n  \n  \n  \n**What made you decide to become worship leaders together?**  \n  \nWe both had a heart to serve the church and lead worship and so it was a natural movement toward writing for those people. We actually never had any intention of becoming a band, but sometimes the Lord has other plans! Now we are so grateful for the opportunities we have to serve our church and other churches!  \n  \n  \n  \n**What do you hope to accomplish with your career?**  \n  \nTo resource the church with music to sing as a response to the goodness of God.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Your job title is listed as “Worship Designers.” What is a Worship Designer?**  \n  \nWe believe that worship is more than just music and singing, and our style of leadership is that we serve those who we lead. Our Sunday morning gatherings involve so many subtle elements of design, and so David and I are blessed to be a part of a team that dreams and creates an atmosphere of praise beyond just singing and leading!  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why is worship through music or art important?**  \n  \nI heard a definition once that said worship is \"extravagant love and extreme submission.\" We have an opportunity each week to gather as a community to bring our love and submission to Jesus. It is in our nature to respond to things that we love...when you see a sunset, you immediately take out your phone and snap a picture and then show everyone!! We praise things of beauty, and God is most beautiful!  \n  \n  \n  \n**Any advice or words of wisdom you would give to someone with a passion for creating music or art?**   \n  \nIf your desire is to serve your church with your music, the best way to do that is to know your church. You cannot lead those who you do not know. Dig in to life and [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/) and watch the way God unfolds stories and praise and response. And if your heart is for art and music outside of the church, stay centered. Know who gave you the desire and use it to glorify Him!  \n  \n  \n  \n_\"He is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.\" - John Piper_  \n  \n  \n  \nMany thanks to Leslie for taking the time to speak with us!

For me, this simple verse speaks to the core of community.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you think about and focus on every divinely written word in that verse, one might argue that it is the perfect description of living in biblical community. But like many other things that we are charged to do and uphold in Scripture, it is NOT easy. Our natural instincts have a way of lending themselves to selfish ambition, exaltation, and preservation, despite what we tell ourselves.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis verse was not something I stumbled upon on my own. A girl in my community group shared Romans 12:15 with me during a time when I certainly didn't feel like \"rejoicing\" with the girls in my group. Over one summer, nearly half of them got engaged and were planning 3 weddings over a span of 6 weeks. Out came the magazines, Pinterest boards, invitations to go dress shopping, bridal fairs, music playlists, bridesmaid dresses, and everything in between. Years ago, I thought that by this age, I would also be among them and planning for a wedding. What girl in her mid-twenties doesn't think about that? It quickly came to my attention that God would need to change my heart if I was going to be able to genuinely rejoice with these girls; because at that point in time, sincere joy was not something I could muster on my own. This golden nugget of Scripture was quite honestly the LAST thing I wanted to hear from this girl. But I know that God intended for me to hear it, even if it came from someone else.  \n  \n  \n  \nLooking into the context of Romans 12:15, I found it was tucked in the middle of a section titled, \"Love in Action\" ([Romans 12:9-21](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2012:9-21&version=NIV1984)). As I read more, I began to hear all my selfish thoughts disappear and the truth of God pour out among these words, especially from verse 10, \"Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourselves.\" Was I devoted to this group of girls? Yes, I thought so. But how was I devoted to them? Was it out of love or out of convenience; in deep or in shallow friendship terms? Who was I honoring when I rejoiced with them to their faces, but in my heart I knew it wasn't sincere? Who could possibly be an example of what it looks like to honor one another above themselves?  \n  \n  \n  \nChrist. In Mark 10:45, He states the purpose of His ministry here on earth. It had nothing to do with selfish ambition, exaltation, and preservation. It was quite the opposite: \"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” If we are to live like Christ, we are to share in other people's joys and despairs, put love into action by honoring others before ourselves, and help others without expectation. Does that sound like what our worldly culture values? How many people do you know who genuinely share in other people's triumphs and pains among their work colleagues, weekend friends, neighbors, or their own family? Loving and living like Christ looks so incredibly different than loving and living the way our world does. And because of living in biblical community, where the girls around me were seeking their counsel from Scripture, they were able to encourage, challenge, and spur me on toward exemplifying Christ.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo here's my challenge to all of you in community right now: consider how you have been rejoicing and mourning with the folks around you. How has your devotion to your community group developed throughout your time together? Have there been moments, looking back, where you needed to resemble Christ more by seeking to serve others before yourself?  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd if you are on the fence about joining a community group, I don't blame you. Maybe, in your experience, you've encountered people who are living opposite of how Scripture calls us to live in the verses mentioned above, perhaps even from folks who call themselves Christians. But without members of my community group pointing me to Scripture, I don't know how I could have stood up as a bridesmaid (3 times), given a maid-of-honor speech, and truly rejoiced with everyone else around me like I've been able to. I'm so grateful for the girls in my life who have shared Scripture with me, even when I wasn't searching for it. Through community, I know without a doubt, that God has changed my heart...not just regarding weddings, but for every opportunity where He may use me to lovingly honor and serve those around me.  \n  \n"},"url":{"en-US":"rejoice-with-those-who-rejoice"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/rejoice-with-those-who-rejoice/"}}},

All young adults, however, want to be called to something. So, first of all, call them to something great, and do so consistently and with clarity.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is back to the basics. Jesus used young adults to change the world. Think about it: He could have used toddlers or the elderly, but instead he chose some guys most likely between 18 and 39 and said, “Follow Me.” So, we should do the same and say, “Follow Jesus.” _Let the dead bury the dead, sell everything you have and give it to the poor, throw down your nets, take up your cross_ and FOLLOW JESUS.  \n  \n  \n  \nYoung adults are desperate to do something great. So were the disciples. One of their most frequently asked questions was “Who is the greatest?” Young adults will run to social justice opportunities, not realizing the gospel is even greater. We _should_ give away shoes, and water, and food, and clothes, and build houses, but we should do it in the name of Jesus. Call them to trade in their boring, vanilla dreams of wealth and suburban retirement for a mission to change the world in the name of Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Call Out Sin**  \n  \nSecondly, call out sin. If you love young adults, and want them to experience life in Jesus, then call out when they are pursuing death instead. Life is not found in pornography, materialism, premarital sex, shots of tequila, or self-righteous thinking. So, tell them that.  \n  \n  \n  \nYes, grace through faith is God’s free gift and offers us salvation in Christ. And anyone who has experienced that grace is being changed by the Holy Spirit and called away from their sin. We need to provide places where people can find accountability. This accountability is defined by people who are committed to knowing each other and loving God, and who will remind each other who they are in Christ when that perspective is lost.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Provide a Solution**  \n  \nThirdly, provide a solution to their sin. They can’t stop on their own, so give them Jesus. Remind them of the beauty of the gospel, lest it become a stale replica of the vibrant truth it is. The solution to someone’s porn problem or spending problem isn’t to stop doing _anything_. It is to START following Jesus. You can’t follow sin and Jesus at the same time. Somehow that message has been lost among millennials. Remind them what is so amazing about grace so that they don’t give up when they [revisit vomit like dogs](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2026:11&version=NIV1984).  \n  \n  \n  \n**Be Real**  \n  \nLastly, be real. I know who I am and I know who I’m not. I am rarely the smartest person in the room. I’m a guy from a small town, with an irrelevant education, and a big heart to see lives change. My twitter bio reads like this: _A porn addict, alcoholic, narcissistic, materialistic, dead-man-walking who heard good news about a new life, and cant stop talking about it._ That’s me, so why would I pretend it’s not?  \n  \n  \n  \nGod works through that. I’ve noticed a clear trend: whenever someone talks about their failures and the hope they've found in Christ, other people then talk about their own failures and find hope in Him too. I’m convinced that our biggest sin struggles become our greatest evangelical tools when we talk about the hope we’ve found in Jesus. This shows we are not in bondage to sin any longer. Indeed, [His power is made perfect in our weakness](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20cor%2012:9&version=NIV1984).  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, I hope this helps, and I hope The LORD raises up a generation that will return this country to Him.

It goes like this...  \n  \n  \n  \nHe grew up around Dallas and was unchurched; God and spiritual things were simply not on his radar screen. He went off to college at SMU a spiritual blank slate, if you will. Like most of the rest, he just sought after the things that appealed to his flesh—fraternity life, partying, girls, sports, etc. He was \"successful\" in all these worldly ways—made good grades, great fraternity, lots of \"friends\" there, and dated beautiful girls. Though he had all of this, he wondered...is this it or is there more?  \n  \n  \n  \nHis Junior year was a pivotal year, one that would change his life forever. What happened? Well, some guys in his finance class struck up a relationship with him (he was their tutor), and they invited him over one night. Out in their backyard, they engaged him on spiritual matters and asked him two questions that he would not be able to shake. They asked: if you were to die tonight and stand before God and He asked why He should let you into heaven, what would you say? And based on that, how sure were you that you'd be in?  \n  \n  \n  \nBam! This challenged him so much. He realized that how we spend our forever and ever was \"the question\" and if there were clear answers, he definitely needed to explore them. He started going to church and received his first Bible when he was twenty. He started reading God's Word ferociously and asking questions. Not long after, Truth became clear to him. He came to trust in the work of God's Son, Jesus, who was sent to the world to make full payment for the sins he knew he'd committed against a holy and perfect God. Because he had trusted in Christ's work and not his own good works, he saw in the Scriptures ([1 John 5:11-13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:11-13&version=NIV1984)) that he could clearly KNOW where he would spend eternity. Everything changed that day for him in 2004.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt gets better. These guys from his finance class would surround him for the next seven years almost 24/7. They moved in together; hung out on the weekends hunting, fishing, and watching sports; and of course went to a local church, served, and studied God's Word together. They \"lived life\" together and talked about what God was doing in their lives—what they were learning as they studied God's word and ways that they needed to be held accountable to God's will for their lives. This guy's life was changed radically month after month, year after year. God was using these men to literally change his life; to conform him into the image of Jesus. Five years later, he met a Godly and beautiful woman, married her and they now have a baby together. This guy is now the spiritual leader of his family and serving the Lord in vocational ministry.  \n  \n  \n  \nI love this story! And the reason is...well...that's my story! That's what God has done in my life! I am so grateful.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs I reflect back, those men were so pivotal to the life change that God brought about in my life. The idea of \"you are who you hang out with\" is a Biblical idea ([Proverbs 13:20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2013:20&version=NIV1984)). When we talk about [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/), this is essentially what we are talking about—men and women in our lives on a consistent basis who love, care for, accept, encourage, hold accountable, and spur us on to loving God and others.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is my passion and job at Watermark to help people looking for community find what I have found. Don't miss our next [GroupLink](http://www.watermark.org/connect/singles-grouplink/) starting this Sunday, January 27th. And, as always, Open Community Group meets every Tuesday night immediately after the Porch message. Let us know if we can serve you!  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are in community, what is [your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/category/our-stories/)? How did God bring that about for you?

That is a simple, factual truth that we have a really hard time accepting. Is it important? It is important that you can cherish your wife, that you can look at her and see her as an incredible gift. It is important that you can love her sacrificially ([Ephesians 5:25](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%205:25&version=NIV1984)), and treat her with respect ([1 Peter 3:7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203:7&version=NIV1984)).  \n  \n  \n  \nMonica is the standard of beauty to me. She has become even more beautiful than when I first met her. However, when we're staying up all night with sick kids, getting thrown up on, and being on mission in an increasingly hostile world, her \"good looks\" are her least important qualities. I don’t need a “trophy wife; I need someone to go to war with me.  \n  \n  \nI was referring to the “trophy wife” as our modern culture defines it. However, you do want to look for a wife who is \"priceless,\" and who is the prize the Scripture defines.  \n  \n  \n  \n**10 Things a Man Should Look For (And a Woman Should Be)**  \n  \nIn no particular order. Marry a girl who is:\n\n  \n1. **Trustworthy.** Is she dependable? Can you be confident she is going to do what she commits to do? ([1 Timothy 3:11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%203:11&version=NIV1984))\n  \n2. **Modest.** Fearing God means you are more concerned about what He thinks and says than what people think or say. A woman who fears God would dress modestly rather than show extra skin to get attention from (the wrong kind of) men. ([1 Peter 3:3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203:3&version=NIV1984))\n  \n3. **Peaceful.** A peaceful woman is not about drama, or picking fights, but about pursuing and preserving unity. ([1 Peter 3:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203:4&version=NIV1984))\n  \n4. **Diligent.** That is actually what much of Proverbs 31 is about: being a hard worker and taking care of what needs to be done, when it needs to be done. ([Proverbs 31:13-18](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2031:13-18&version=NIV1984))\n  \n5. **Compassionate.** Does she care for those in need? ([Proverbs 31:20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2031:20&version=NIV1984))\n  \n6. **Respectful.** It has been said that whereas women need love, men need respect. This is displayed in the way she talks to and about others. ([Ephesians 5:33](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%205:33&version=NIV1984))\n  \n7. **Submissive to authority.** Ah, the “S” word. Women, before you get upset and start talking about equal partnerships, go back and look at #1 on the [list of things to look for in a man](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-woman-should-look-for-in-a-man/). ([1 Peter 3:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20peter%203:1&version=NIV1984))\n  \n8. **Responsible.** Does she plan ahead? Does she handle resources wisely? This idea is all throughout Scripture referring to a wife from The Lord. ([Proverbs 31:21](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2031:21&version=NIV1984))\n  \n9. **Wise.** A wise person makes good decisions and gives good instruction. ([Proverbs 31:26](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2031:26&version=NIV1984))\n  \n10. **Committed to Christ.** Christ should be the focus of her life. This looks like yielding to His word, being prayerful, living in community, and being committed to a body of believers. If this is there, #1-9 will be there, too. ([Galatians 5:22-25](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:22-25&version=NIV1984))\n  \n  \n“A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.” ([Proverbs 31:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+31%3A10&version=NIV)) That’s a trophy wife. That’s the true prize. “Give her the reward she has earned.” ([Proverbs 31:31a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+31%3A31a&version=NIV))  \n  \n  \n  \nSingle men, if you are pursuing God yourself and are ready for marriage, find the most godly woman you know and [ask her out](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dating-101-the-ask/). Single girls, if a godly man asks you out and you are open to dating, say yes. If you say no, be honest as to why. [Men, be intentional; women, be honest](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dating-101-lets-be-honest/). If you are walking closely with Jesus and dating a girl you can cherish who exemplifies the above, \"put a ring on it.\"  \n    \n  \n– JP\n\n(Originally posted on February 4th, 2013)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"6eQQbjEs3Ce8WgcCOiOi00"}}},"url":{"en-US":"10-things-a-man-should-look-for-in-a-woman"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/10-things-a-man-should-look-for-in-a-woman/"}}},

These were traits that good husbands tend to have, and are things that guys should strive to be.  \n  \n  \n  \nEven good guys won’t be perfect, and won’t fully do those things 100% of the time. Any real relationship must include forgiveness, and having a successful marriage requires _a lot_ of forgiveness. Before committing to marriage, though, you don’t want to overlook too many red flags. Because although there are positive characteristics you should look for in a guy, there are also negative traits that you should avoid. And though I do desire for you to be in a relationship, I want it to be a healthy relationship.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, if you are considering going down the dating road with someone, here are 10 signs that you should probably take a U-turn and look somewhere else.  \n  \n  \n  \n**10 Signs You Are Dating the Wrong Guy**  \nIn no particular order. Girls, avoid marrying a guy who is:\n\n  \n1. **Unknown.** To make dating simpler, remember that the pool of people available for you to date is probably a relatively small group. If you don’t know who they are and what they are about, you can’t consider whether they have the important characteristics you are looking for. ([Proverbs 18:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2018:17&version=NIV1984))\n  \n2. **Sexually immoral.** Basically, this means he is not willing to set boundaries and wait until marriage for the pursuit of sexual pleasure. If he appears to be a godly guy until he gets you alone, he may just be a good actor. ([Ephesians 5:3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5:3&version=NIV1984))\n  \n3. **Arrogant.** Is he willing to admit when he is wrong? Does he listen to and respect your opinion? ([Psalm 119:21](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20119:21&version=NIV1984))\n  \n4. **Insecure.** Does he focus on his inadequacies or the inadequacies of others? Does he put others down in order to feel better about himself? ([2 Timothy 1:7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%201:7&version=NIV1984))\n  \n5. **Dishonest.** I don’t think this one really needs any explanation. ([Luke 16:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+16:10&version=NIV1984))\n  \n6. **Passive.** Does he let you know where you stand, or leave you guessing about the relationship and his intentions? Does he even know what his intentions are? Guys, this is a big part of that ambiguous “leading well” term you keep hearing about. ([1 Timothy 3:12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20timothy%203:12&version=NIV1984))\n  \n7. **Selfish.** Does he focus mostly on what he has and what he wants? Is his status or reputation his primary motive? If he is focused on self and does not consider the needs of others, he will fail miserably at loving his wife as Christ loved the church. ([Ephesians 5:25](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%205:25&version=NIV1984))\n  \n8. **Unforgiving.** Does he hold grudges? We have all been forgiven much and should therefore be willing to forgive others. ([Matthew 18:21-22](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018:21-22&version=NIV1984))\n  \n9. **Angry.** Does he “blow up” at little problems? Trust me, there are going to be a lot of little problems in marriage. And let’s go ahead and institute a “one strike” rule: if he strikes you once, he’s out. ([Proverbs 22:24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2022:24&version=NIV1984))\n  \n10. **An unbeliever.** If you are following Christ, then this is non-negotiable. Put away your excuses or justifications. We’re talking about contrasting worldviews that are (or should be) at the heart of everything you do in life. If you are a believer and are willing to marry someone who does not believe in God, then you need to ask yourself what you are a “believer” in.

My main strategy is to move towards my destination (Watermark). My second strategy is to avoid anything that might prevent or distract me from getting there on time. For example, I try to limit the number of red lights, dodge potholes, and avoid traffic jams or accidents.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn a way, I believe dating can be as simple as these two strategies. If you are a single guy and desire a spouse—something that the Bible says is good ([Proverbs 18:22](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2018:22&version=NIV))—it is up to you to initiate and be moving down that path (strategy 1). But you also want to avoid potholes and accidents (strategy 2), by not dating women that you ultimately wouldn’t want to spend the rest of your life with.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, below is a list of dating “U-Turns,” or signs that you may need to turn around and not go down the dating path with someone.  \n  \n  \n  \n**10 Signs You Are Dating the Wrong Girl**  \n  \nIn no particular order. Guys, avoid marrying a girl who is:\n\n  \n1. **Unknown.** This is the same as in the [list of things a woman should avoid](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dont-date-this-man/). If you don’t know anything about her, you don’t know whether she is worth pursuing. ([Proverbs 18:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2018:17&version=NIV))\n  \n2. **Quarrelsome.** See also nagging, angry, harsh, and unforgiving. This one is unusually prevalent in Scripture, which compares such women to water torture and says it would be better to live “in a desert” or “on the corner of the roof” than with a quarrelsome wife. ([Proverbs 27:15-16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2027:15-16&version=NIV))\n  \n3. **Sexually immoral.** This refers not to her past, but to her present. If she is not committed to purity, it will be that much harder for you to stay committed. And if she dresses slightly undressed, beware. ([Proverbs 7:10-27](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%207:10-27&version=NIV))\n  \n4. **Vain.** Is she stuck in the mirror of self-worship? Is she focused on temporary outward adornment, or lasting inner beauty? ([1 Peter 3:3-4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203:3-4&version=NIV))\n  \n5. **Materialistic.** Is she greedy, and obsessed with having comforts in this life? Does she want you, or want what you have? There is never any end to “want”; nothing will ever be enough. ([Hebrews 13:5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013:5&version=NIV))\n  \n6. **A gossip.** Does she delight in finding fault with people and putting other people down? Is she negative, finding the worst in every situation and in every person? If she does it with others, she will do it with you. ([Ephesians 4:29-32](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:29-32&version=NIV))\n  \n7. **Selfish.** Jesus said that all of God’s law boils down to “Love the Lord” and “Love your neighbor.” If she mostly loves herself, she’s not doing either. ([James 3:13-16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%203:13-16&version=NIV))\n  \n8. **Dishonest.** Is she manipulative or deceitful? If she lies in the small things she may lie in the big things. ([Proverbs 6:16-19](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%206:16-19&version=NIV))\n  \n9. **Rebellious.** Does she avoid community and accountability? Does she reject biblical truths and deny or defy authority? ([Ephesians 5:21-24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:21-24&version=NIV))\n  \n10. **An unbeliever.** You cannot be her savior. If she is not pursuing Christ first and foremost, don’t pursue her. ([2 Corinthians 6:14](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%206:14&version=NIV))\n  \n  \nNobody is perfect, of course, or even all that close to perfect. And don’t expect her to be your savior, either. In many ways, you should be the one leading her in godliness. But by watching out for these negative traits and focusing on the [things you should look for in a wife](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-man-should-look-for-in-a-woman/), you can avoid ending up in a place of [disappointment, despair, or divorce](http://www.watermark.org/media/dating-disappointments/2454/).  \n  \n  \n  \nLove God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength—and date someone who does the same.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP"},"url":{"en-US":"dont-date-this-woman"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/dont-date-this-woman/"}}},

At the end of myself: desperate, hopeless, and helpless.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn spite of graduating with honors at the University of Kansas, rejection after rejection painfully mocked each freshly submitted resume. My live-in girlfriend and I had mapped out every detail of our future together, except for the part where she broke up with me over the phone. Years of \"growing up\" with all the answers left me living in my parents' basement - trapped by failure, frustration, and the fine line between my expectations and \"the real world.\" I found myself following a habit that I resorted to as a child, literally waking up and running to my parents' bed at night to cry or be comforted. Only this time I was 23, hating myself more than ever. If I did not escape my own prison, my life was literally going to be the death of me.  \n  \n  \n  \nI desperately moved to Dallas for a fresh start in December '09. Little did I know the new life I would ultimately find. I arrived in Dallas knowing no one and started a job as a boot camp instructor at several of the local parks. I trained for several months at Anderson Bonner Park without knowing the big, boxy building across the street was even a church, until one of my boot campers invited me to The Porch.  \n  \n  \n  \nI took her up on her offer and will never forget hearing \"[How He Loves](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-he-loves/)\" for the first time. I had grown up in the church, but abandoned my faith and worshiped myself and followed my own selfish and destructive desires throughout high school and college. I had become a dead believer (or non-believer). I did not have a relationship with Jesus, was not actively pursuing Him or His Word, and my life reflected self-centeredness in every way imaginable. I experienced fleeting pleasure in the form of athletic and academic success, drunkenness, the bar scene, sex, porn, betting, and relationships, but each of these ultimately enslaved me, rather than offering the hope inherent with surrendering my desperate and darkened heart to Christ, the Light of the World.  \n  \n  \n  \n_At one time, we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. But when the kindness and love of our God appeared, He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy. – Titus 3:3-5a_  \n  \n  \n  \nToday, my story is His story. God has transformed my mess into His message of grace, hope, and love. He has redeemed my deepest pains and restored my bitterness and brokenness. Through [authentic community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-difference-does-it-make-if-im-in-community-really/), I have confronted the areas that entangled me, while receiving loving and sincere encouragement every step of the way.

Growing up I always thought \"community\" was the place where you lived, and the people that surrounded you were part of your community. And yes, that is one definition of community. However, after moving to Dallas a few years ago and really learning what actually \"being in community\" meant, I was able to really reflect on where I had experienced community before.  \n  \n  \n  \nUpon learning about community, I was able to see that the first time I really experienced this close-knit bond with people where Christ is the center was in college. The community that God placed around me freshman year helped pull me out of the depression I had felt and brought me to life in Christ. They pointed me towards who I am in Christ and not who I am through the eyes of others. That community was the first place I experienced \"art worship\" (ask me if you would like to know more), and that changed the way I was able to experience Christ.  \n  \n  \n  \nThen, moving on to Tulsa and not having a close community, I was able to see the importance Christ placed on community in our lives. Christ called us to be a part of the body and fellowship with other believers on a deeper level. As it states in [1 Corinthians 12:13-27](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2012:13-27&version=NIV), we all have a function in the body of Christ and are all gifted in different areas. That is the beauty of [everyone in your group being different than you](http://theporch.wpengine.com/acceptance-what-god-teaches-me-through-people-who-arent-like-me/). However, when you are living in community with others it is easy to see everyone else’s faults and not their gifts. I would encourage you, if you are in a group, to look at what you don't understand about a person and how that trait may actually be a gift God gave them to function as a part of the body of Christ. They may have the ability to minister to people in a different way than you; encourage them in that and spur them on.  \n  \n  \n  \nI think that sometimes community gets put in a box, but it's your group, family, or friends that love you enough to \"do life with you.\" They lovingly point out your shortcomings, get excited when you are doing the Lord's will, keep you accountable with authenticity, and spur you on to pursue Christ more everyday ([Proverbs 27:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%2027:17&version=NIV)). For me, the most exciting part about community is that we get to be the hands and feet of Christ to each other. We get the opportunity to show the same grace Christ gave us, to others. And let me tell you, if you have been in community, you know how much grace you get to give others and how much grace is given to you.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe are called to live in community and not live in isolation. Do you have community? If not, let me tell you what it’s done for me.

She and I had known each other since we were 9, and I had already met all of the girls in her group. So, I was very comfortable joining in and letting someone else lead, while I took on a consumer mentality for the most part.  \n  \n  \n  \nDue to a couple marriages and other life events, our group eventually decreased to four core members. We were all good friends and very open with one another. We took various equipping classes together, prayed together, dealt with family issues, spent time together outside of group, had sessions of accountability over dinner, knew each other’s struggles, took trips together…we were living out community the way it was intended. I was known by them and very, very comfortable continuing in the status quo.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Get Uncomfortable**  \n  \nEventually, the question came up of whether we should continue as a comfortable little group, or step out and each lead new groups. Make no mistake: I was exceedingly content keeping things just the way they were. I resisted. I didn’t want to try something new. I didn’t want to be uncomfortable. I didn’t want the responsibility of leading a new group. Couldn’t the four of us just keep meeting as a community group? I delayed as long as possible, and kept sending the message that I was praying about it and processing, but really, how do you pray about something that you are completely closed off to? How do you ask God for guidance when, in your mind, you are completely unwilling?  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, the other three thought we had grown as much as we could as a group and were all in agreement to split up and serve as leaders for new groups. I was left with the option of co-leading a group with one of the other three members, joining another group, or just forgetting about this whole community group thing. I reluctantly agreed to serve as a co-leader, but ONLY to launch the group. The plan was that after six weeks, we would select a member of the group to step up as the permanent leader and “be on our way.” I was fine with this short-term commitment as it was comfortable and definitive. Oh, how God had different plans.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Many are the plans in a man’s heart, but it is the Lord’s purpose that prevails. - Proverbs 19:21_   \n  \n  \n  \nI still remember our first meeting and seeing all the new faces. It was such a different experience, not knowing any of the girls and having to model community for those who had never experienced it before. The funny thing is, after six weeks, I couldn’t bring myself to leave the group. It just didn’t feel right. I finally surrendered to God and decided that I would remain as one of their leaders and, praise the Lord, they let me stay.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Learning By Leading**  \n  \nI remember wanting things to click immediately and for everyone to be 100% open to accountability right out of the gate. As much as I thought it was my job to challenge them, God flipped it on me and I was challenged to lead out in knowing God’s Word, committing His truths to memory, reminding them of God’s faithfulness, faithfully attending every group meeting, and demonstrating openness and authenticity. As time went by, God brought together 8 very different girls and knitted our hearts together in a way I never could have imagined. By giving Him my old community group and accepting the gift of this new community group, I was blessed beyond all my expectations.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe have been together almost three years now, and I can honestly say that this group is one of the most beautiful gifts I have been given. God’s plan was so much better than mine. All it took was me surrendering to His will with open arms, and in place, He filled me to overflowing with the blessing of discomfort."},"url":{"en-US":"the-blessing-of-discomfort"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-blessing-of-discomfort/"}}},

Consider this: God could have made us super productive humans who don't need to stop, but He didn't. He made us so that we need rest. He made us need sleep. He even went as far as turning off the lights so that we couldn't be as productive, and in an early agrarian society the work would have to stop.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe problem is we now have technologies (such as electric lights) that allow us to work around the clock, but our bodies won't. Mental illnesses are at an all-time high, and many experts are tracing the problems back to sleep, or to the lack thereof. Personally, every case of psychosis that I've pastored someone through has involved sleep deprivation.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Sleep: Get You Some**  \n  \n[A friend](http://noahsdad.com/) of mine recently visited a sleep specialist to get help with his insomnia. His big takeaways were simple and yet effective, so I thought I would pass them on here. If getting a good night’s sleep is never a problem for you, then these tips might not be necessary; but I think a significant percentage of people do struggle with not getting enough sleep.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe five keys to getting a good night’s sleep are:\n\n  \n1. **Be still and in bed for 7 hours.** The magic number of hours of sleep needed is different for everyone, but few people can be healthy on less than 7. For a base line, though, don't even make it about sleep necessarily. Just make it your goal to be still and in bed for at least 7 straight hours.\n  \n2. **Get up at the same time each day.** Try to set your body’s natural alarm clock by getting up at the same time each day. Rather than \"sleeping in\" on the weekends, or trying to catch up on sleep that you’ve missed, get up at the same time each day. I have [a 5-month-old](http://theporch.wpengine.com/letter-to-weston/) who can help.\n  \n3. **No caffeine for 10 hours before you go to bed.** Caffeine is a powerful, addictive stimulant. Your body works in a natural rhythm, and stimulants like caffeine can throw that rhythm off.\n  \n4. **No close-by lit technology (like computers, tablets, or cell phones) for 3 hours before you go to bed.** This is a big one, and the reason is very interesting. Our bodies’ rhythms revolve around light. Sunrise signals our bodies to wake up. Sunset signals our body to go to sleep. Holding a lit screen close to your face serves as a replica sun, signaling to your body that it is not time to shut down, but rather time to wake up. A television far from your body can be the exception, and reflective lighting (the lights in your house) is fine. Also, stay away from bright alarm clocks or setting your iPhone right before bed.\n  \n5. **No problem-solving for 3 hours before you go to bed.** This is where [worry](http://www.watermark.org/media/worry/2501/) canreally cut into your sleep, keeping your brain running when it is supposed to be shutting down to recharge. So don't think too strategically or emotionally before you go to bed. If something is running around in your head, write it down and pick it up the next day.\n  \n  \nIf you have trouble sleeping, try these tips for 30 days. It will be a challenge at first, but I believe you will find it helps you catch some Zs.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat helps you sleep?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP"},"url":{"en-US":"5-keys-to-a-good-nights-sleep"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/5-keys-to-a-good-nights-sleep/"}}},

And according to Wikipedia, the color originally associated with St. Patrick was blue, not green.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn fact, there are several things you might not expect about St. Patrick:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. He wasn’t Irish.**   \nHe was from Britain, most likely from what is now northwest England. He did end up in Ireland, but only because _he was kidnapped at age 16 and taken there as a slave_.  \n  \n  \n  \nHe worked there, against his will, as a shepherd. After six years, God spoke to him in a dream and told him there was a ship he could escape on. So he ran off—200 miles off—and did find a ship, and did eventually make it back to Britain.  \n  \n**2. He wasn’t a saint.**  \nKind of a trick question, since nobody is born a saint, regardless of how you define the term. But here’s how Patrick described himself:  \n  \n  \n  \n_I, Patrick, a sinner, the rudest and the least of all the faithful, and an object of the greatest contempt to many…_  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd I don’t think that was false humility. He mentions a time that the church elders “came forth and brought up my sins as an objection,” and it had to do with something he had done _30 years before_, when he was about 15. Interestingly, Patrick doesn’t tell us what he did—it was _that bad_—and when he told his secret 30 years after the fact, church elders thought he was not fit to continue in ministry.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut he did continue. In fact, it was possibly just after that confrontation that he did the most interesting thing:  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. He went back to save those who enslaved him.**   \nPeople thought he was crazy for doing it. No, really. He wrote:  \n  \n  \n  \n_For many tried to prevent this my mission; they would even talk to each other behind my back and say: “Why does this fellow throw himself into danger among enemies who have no knowledge of God?”_  \n  \n  \n  \nIreland was considered a really vile nation at the time (about 430 A.D.). Besides slavery, they were known for incest, bestiality, and all kinds of crazy wild stuff. They worshiped pagan gods, and associated Patrick with a supposed Druid prophecy that unflatteringly warned about one “crazed in the head” who would come from “across the sea.” They chained him, robbed him, and beat him.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhy would he go back? Why did he willingly suffer abuse, and dedicate the rest of his life to try reaching those who had enslaved him and abused him? What kind of person does that?  \n  \n  \n  \nThe kind of person they name a day after, for starters.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut I think it’s actually because he _wasn’t_ a saint, or at least didn’t start out that way. He knew that he had been [forgiven much](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7%3A47&version=NIV). He knew that he actually deserved slavery, if not for God’s forgiveness. That he was no better than the Irish. So, God gave him a heart to reach out to those people, and even specifically to his old slave master.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. He changed the world.**   \nAccording to some historians, the impact he had on Ireland later ended up [saving civilization](http://www.amazon.com/Irish-Saved-Civilization-Hinges-History/dp/0385418493).  \n  \n  \n  \nIreland was most definitely _not_ a Christian nation when Patrick started preaching the gospel there.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd it most definitely _was_ a Christian nation when he finished.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, among other things, St. Patrick’s Day is really about [forgiveness](http://www.theporch.live/messages/5185). The kind of forgiveness, faithfulness, and love that can change a life. Change many lives. [Change the world](http://www.theporch.live/blogs/how-to-change-the-world/). \n  \n  \n  \nThat, and [shamrocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock#Link_to_St._Patrick).  \n  \n  \n  \nHow are you spending St. Patrick’s Day?  \n  \n  \n  \n– JP\n\n\n\n*Original publish date March 2013*\n\n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"lNc9GWYkKcOQM0AQOwYAQ"}}},"url":{"en-US":"who-is-st-patrick"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/who-is-st-patrick/"}}},

When Presley was younger, we would go to the grocery store together and I would grab the cart with the car on front and let her “drive.” We had a lot of fun as I'd watch her turn the wheel left or right and I'd push the cart in the direction she wanted to go. She thought that she was driving, and enjoyed operating under the illusion of control.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe would play this game for a little while, but eventually I'd have a grocery list that I needed to knock out. After all, we weren't there to play, we were there to get the things we needed. You can imagine what happened next. Presley turned the wheel right, but I needed to go left. As I took us left, she became frustrated and gripped the wheel and with all her might turned it right. Effortlessly, I continued to take us left to get done what we needed to get done.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Who’s Driving This Thing?**  \n  \nI think that provides a pretty good picture of how we, as adults, become stressed and worried over the issue of control. Worry is _always_ directly related to control, because if we fully trusted whoever has control over our situation, we would have no reason to worry about what will happen. The problem comes when we either don’t know who is in control, or don’t trust the one who is driving. Think about it:\n\n  \n- If you believe that _you_ are driving, and are the one in control of your situation, then you will worry if you do not fully trust in your ability to produce the outcome you want. You might not make that sale, or might screw up that date with “the one.”\n  \n- If you believe that _no one_ is driving, and life is all random chance, then you probably should be worried, because anything could happen at any time for no reason at all.\n  \n- If you believe that _God_ is driving, and you still find yourself worried, then you are not trusting that His plan is actually in your best interests.\n  \n  \nThe first option, where _you_ are in control, is actually part of most religions: the idea that your eternal fate depends on you successfully doing or not doing certain things. Since you can mess up at any time and might not have a chance to repent, you can never be free from worry.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe second option is at the core of the atheist worldview. There is no control, and life is like one big game of roulette. Your greatest hope is \"good luck.\"  \n  \n  \n  \nTo me, though, the third source of worry is the most troublesome one. It would mean you believe that God has a plan, but that plan is to harm you. Plus, since [God says quite clearly](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jeremiah%2029:11&version=NIV) that His plans for you are good, that would make Him out to be a cruel liar.  \n  \n  \n  \nPretending to offer what is good, while secretly setting you up for harm, doesn’t sound like God at all. In fact, that sounds pretty much exactly like [that other guy](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&version=NIV). You’re not believing God; you’re believing [Satan’s lies](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A44&version=NIV). Satan’s M.O., even from [the garden of Eden](http://www.watermark.org/media/the-fall/2460/), has been to convince people that God is not good and that we should be the ones in control.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe truth is that God is in control, and [He is good](http://theporch.wpengine.com/is-god-good/). He wants what is best for you. His power is infinite, and He loves us. Since He is completely in control and [completely loves us](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:7-8&version=NIV), we can trust Him in unemployment, late projects, breakups, singleness, sickness, and even death. He makes [_all_ things work out for the good for those who love Him](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:28&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nUnderstand and trust in the fact that God is driving. He knows exactly where you need to go, and will take you on the best route to get to your destination. Trust in His control, and you will never have to worry.  \n  \n– JP"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"3wpU8HPn9eyYE22mSOagie"}}},"url":{"en-US":"who-is-in-control"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/who-is-in-control/"}}},

On Twitter, for instance, the hashtag #LoveIsLove has been trending, apparently started by some fellow with the handle @BarackObama. Can’t really argue with that equation: “love is love.” Indeed. Also, judo is judo and 5-hydroxytryptamine is 5-hydroxytryptamine. Unfortunately, none of this tells you _anything_ about what those words actually mean.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Love is…**  \n  \nThis is relevant because there seems to be some confusion today about what “love” actually is. There are things being done in love that [many people decry as hate](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-do-you-hate-me/), and probably things being done in hate that the perpetrators describe as love. And Christians, who are [supposed to have love as their defining characteristic](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2013:35&version=NIV), are most often at the center of such debates.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo if we are going to proclaim “love is love,” perhaps we really should answer the question “What is love?” ([Baby don’t hurt me, don’t hurt me…](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/babydont.gif))  \n  \n  \n  \nMost people today would describe love as an emotion: a strong positive feeling towards someone or something. So, one could say “I love you” or “I love nachos,” and both instances of the word have roughly the same meaning. Though this may be the common definition, there are two downsides to it:  \n\n  \n- Feelings change. See also the 50% divorce rate.\n  \n- It can put the focus more on yourself than on the other person. For instance, I don’t think you would appreciate this kind of love if _you are the nacho_.\n  \n  \n**Love as a Verb**  \n  \nThere is another definition of love. If you are [down with the DC Talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRfFuhrdGKM), you might already realize that this definition starts with a “v.”  \n  \n  \n  \nThis love is an action. It means that you actively do what is best for the other person, even if that goes against your own best interests. It could sometimes mean letting them go, or telling the truth when that truth might cause them to leave. It is totally selfless. This love would willingly starve before eating a reluctant nacho.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs an action, it is independent of feelings. You can love someone you strongly disagree with. Even love someone who has harmed you, though it might be difficult to do. And it is the only kind of love that you can guarantee will last a lifetime; even when feelings change, you can decide to love someone. If “true love” means love that never ends, it is this kind of love.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How Would Jesus Love?**  \n  \nIf you are a Christian, this is the kind of love that you are called to. Jesus stated that _everything_ we are to do comes down to [loving God and loving your neighbor](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A36-40&version=NIV). He then explained what that looked like by telling [the story of the Good Samaritan](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:29-37&version=NIV): a story which is about actively helping a hurt stranger _who is your sworn enemy_.  \n  \n  \n  \nJesus called us to that kind of love because [that is how God loves us](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John+4:19&version=NIV). He loves those who live as His enemies—which is all of us at one time or another. Jesus demonstrated this by freely forgiving and healing everyone who came to Him for help. He also demonstrated it by boldly speaking truth to the religious leaders who claimed they did _not_ need His help. Instead of _appearing_ to show love by kindly agreeing with and reassuring them, He _truly_ loved them by pointing out that their way would not get them into the heaven they desired.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What's Wrong?**  \n  \nOf course, Jesus was perfect, whereas His followers today...not so much. This has caused problems on both sides of the “love” equation: how that love is shown, and how it is received.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe topic of same-sex relationships—which is what the #LoveIsLove tweet and other social media trends this week were about—is one clear example of that. Many (most?) Christians, myself included, have done a really poor job in this area—sometimes by not showing forgiveness, and sometimes by not speaking the truth. And partly because of the poor way it has been handled, some people feel that they are just being told there is something _wrong_ with them.  \n  \n  \n  \nHere’s the thing: there is something wrong with _everyone_. Nobody comes even close to being perfect. And since God’s standard is perfection, any level short of that is equally missing the mark—any theoretical “better than” or “worse than” doesn’t matter. (Besides, I’m probably more screwed up than you are, anyway.) You, me, Obama, Billy Graham—no one actually deserves true love.  \n  \n  \n  \n**True Love Awaits**   \n  \nIf you’ve been shying away from or even rejecting the idea of God because of that, there is something essential for you to know: God does love you anyway. And we’re not talking about the “feeling” kind of love, though He might feel that way, too. No, remember that God is all about the active kind of love.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod gives you the freedom to do what you will, because that is the loving thing to do, even though it allows you to turn from Him and break the laws that lead to death. And then He shows true love by doing the one thing that could [pay the price](http://theporch.wpengine.com/someone-has-to-pay/) to save us from eternal death.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat kind of love could that be? It looks like this:  \n  \n  \n\n![Jesus on the cross](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cristo_crucificado.jpg)\n\n  \n  \n  \nGod is love. This Easter, please don’t ignore that. Please don’t reject God’s offer of love, or disbelieve it because of some flawed, messed-up humans.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe don’t deserve true love, though it is our greatest desire and we desperately need it. God offers it. We just have to accept it."},"url":{"en-US":"what-love"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-love/"}}},

However, it also seemed like the hardest thing to do.  \n  \n  \n  \nI, along with six other Porch-goers, was in Granada, Nicaragua, for a week on a short-term mission trip with [Living Water International](http://water.cc) to drill a freshwater well for a community that lacked clean drinking water. Though access to life-giving clean water is something we rarely (or never) think about or thank God for in Dallas, it is something that 800 million people in the world do without—making it a leading cause of disease and death.  \n  \n  \n  \nThough we were there to develop a clean water source, that wasn’t the main focus.

The main focus was the people—to show them love, and build relationships, like Christ did.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis idea intimidated me. How can I build a relationship in less than a week? The language barrier, cultural differences, and my own feelings of insignificance all started to weigh me down. Each night our team would discuss our highs and lows of the day, and share what the Lord was teaching us. By the second night, I still had no clue what God was trying to teach me, and was honestly a little frustrated. Then I felt a little tug at my heart and this thought entered my brain: this isn’t about you. I immediately scribbled down John 3:30: \"He must become greater; I must become less.\" This trip wasn’t about me at all—this was about Him.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Lord moves quickly when we move ourselves out of the way, and at that point, things started to change. The next morning we pulled up to the drill site to be greeted with the group of kids we had been playing with the past two days, waiting patiently in dirty clothes and smiles with torn baseball gloves and a single bat in hand. More women had arrived with whatever chairs they owned to hear more hygiene lessons and Bible stories, and without hesitation would trust us to hold their babies and watch their children. When the drillers needed water to flush the pipes, every man, woman, and child pitched in to gather whatever limited water they had in their possession to contribute. As the week continued I was overwhelmed at their generosity and the time that they took out for us, and each other.  \n  \n  \n  \n ![Nicaragua Group](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NicaraguaGroup.jpg \"Nicaragua Group\")  \n  \nWhen we struck water, there was a lot of excitement and joy. But the true joy came from sharing the universal love of our Savior with these people, and seeing the love and gratefulness in them as well. I was humbled at the simplicity of the life they lived, and convicted that I don’t spend nearly enough time building relationships back home. In that short amount of time, we met adults and children who made a huge impact on our lives. We thought we were going to bless them with a well; we were not expecting to be blessed even more in return.  \n  \n  \n  \nTrue joy comes from loving God, and loving your neighbor ([Matthew 22:37-40](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A37-40&version=NIV)). And the best love we can display is the love of Christ and the gospel.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe lessons we learned in Nicaragua apply just as much here in Dallas. Serving God and serving others doesn’t need to be difficult or require you leaving the country. Start here. Look around you. Find a need, great or small, and meet it. But don’t just focus on the immediate need; care enough to talk with them about their eternal needs. Build a relationship and share the living water of the gospel.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd whatever you do, ask the Lord to move you out of the way first. It's not about you. When _our_ desires are removed from the situation and the Lord uses us to do _His_ work, that is when the love of the gospel is truly displayed."},"url":{"en-US":"el-agua-viva-the-living-water"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/el-agua-viva-the-living-water/"}}},

I knew about Jesus and what He had done on the cross, and could recite just about every popular Bible story, but I was also taught that I had to earn my way into Heaven and that only perfect saints who had zero sin on their souls and “did lots of great things” were allowed to enter the Kingdom. So when I was about 12 years old and realized I was indeed a sinner, I began to see no hope, and gave up. Going through the motions to please my family, I saw church as a religion instead of a relationship.  \n  \n  \n  \nI pursued worldly relationships instead—relationships that were centered on my needs and wants: social status, material possessions, partying, alcohol, smoking, self-worth in giving my body over to men for their pleasure, and even manipulation of good things like friendships and sports. Anything that I thought would make ME happy, I pursued. It wasn’t until a serious 3-year relationship with an agnostic ended dramatically my junior year of college that I realized I had nowhere to turn. After abusing different worldly ways to cope, and realizing those weren’t working, I finally surrendered and looked up. I decided to give God a second chance. I mean honestly, what did I have to lose?  \n  \n  \n  \n**A Story of Surrender**  \n  \nMy surrendering began as a journey of Jeremiah 29:13, “You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.”  \n  \n  \n  \nThe first step I took was going on a college church retreat where students shared their testimonies on how God changed their lives. Between the pouring tears of shame, pain, and regret, and the longing for what they had, I remember feeling God’s presence for the first time telling me, \"I'm here. I'm going to rescue you. And I’m going to give you a testimony.\"  \n  \n  \n  \nMy second God-led step was applying to work at a Christian summer camp. That sounded like a good way to spend my summer, and I adored working with kids, but little did I know how much I would end up learning from the experience. As I was sitting with my 7- and 8-year-old campers, listening to the camp staff teach about Jesus, I heard the beautiful story of God’s gift of grace through Jesus Christ for the first time. How could a story I’ve heard multiple times suddenly have such a different meaning—one that didn’t require me to be perfect—one that accepted sinners like me into the Kingdom of Heaven? I immediately believed and accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior. I spent the rest of camp learning more about this decision and building upon a new relationship with my Redeemer.  \n  \n  \n  \n**My Journey Forward**  \n  \nSince then it has been no easy journey. I have still struggled heavily with completely surrendering certain areas of my life to God, but now I'm not alone. I have a Savior and a church I can confide in and turn to when my life gets out of hand or when the world tries to desperately pull me back. God brought me to Watermark through The Porch about a year ago and has grown multiple areas of my life, helping to heal deep wounds that were left from my past. I am now part of a wonderful community group with the most incredible girls who are my running partners in our sprint after Christ. I have found that God provides the means to follow Him if we take the steps to seek and surrender.  \n  \n  \n  \nI never thought a broken, selfish, messed up person like me could be worth rescuing, but Matthew 9:12-14 puts my life into perspective:  \n  \n  \n  \n_On hearing this, Jesus said,_ _“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”_   \n  \n  \n  \nJesus came to earth for people like me—sick, sinning, believing I could earn His grace only through my sacrifice.  \n  \n  \n  \nThrough repentance I have found a forgiveness that is healing. Through sufferings I have found a peace that surpasses all understanding. Through loneliness I have found a love that will never be separated. Through searching I have found an identity that can be trusted. Discovering these biblical truths has brought about a joy that the world can't take away because it didn't put it there. Praise the day I can see my sweet Jesus face to face and thank Him for saving a wretch like me.  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

I get that. It makes sense. So, what’s the difference between getting into a community group and having a group of friends to sit with at church and go grab dinner with on Friday nights? Well, I’d argue that there can be a big difference.  \n  \n  \n  \nBeing in biblical community is far beyond surface level conversations and an occasional Bible study where everyone goes around the circle and gives a Sunday school answer. Biblical community is where spiritual transformation can happen on a deep, intimate level. But, in order for that to happen, group members must be willing to open up deeper than \"My 3<sup>rd</sup> cousin’s dog Sparky has a ringworm...can we pray for him please?\" This takes courage and vulnerability that honestly doesn’t come naturally. You have to work at it.  \n  \n  \n  \n“But, it’s scary to let people I barely know in on the intimate details of my life...my fears, insecurities, budget, sin struggles, pride, etc.” I get that. You’re right; it is scary. And it’s also life-giving and freeing at the same time. Once you get into a group that is committed to biblical community, you must develop a [level of trust](http://theporch.wpengine.com/circle-of-trust/) and work together to create a safe environment where each member of the group feels comfortable sharing openly and honestly. This takes time. It’s not an overnight thing. You can’t microwave biblical community. But, I would say if you’re just staying where it’s comfortable and not seeking and striving to go deeper, you’re in a social club and not a biblical community group.  \n  \n  \n  \nMaybe you’re just not ready yet. That’s okay. But I would challenge you to not stay there. Seek to understand what your underlying fears are of being fully known. What are you hiding that you need to be set free from? Romans 8:1 says: “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” If you are a follower of Christ, you are forgiven. Period. Let others in so that you don’t continue walking in bondage and shame. The first part of James 5:16 says: “Therefore confess your sins to each another and pray for each other so that you may be healed.” We’re not called to walk this road alone.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs I said earlier, you may just be wanting some friends to sit with at church. We’ve got many great opportunities for you to meet others, such as [women’s Bible studies](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/womens-bible-study/), men’s [Summit](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/summit--mens-bible-study/) groups, [Equipped Disciple](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/equipped-disciple/) classes, serving in kid’s ministries, and MANY more. If deep, authentic biblical community is not where your heart is at right now, go get plugged into one of these other places and start making friends. But once you do make friends, and therefore know some people at church that you are becoming comfortable with, consider going deeper with them by starting a community group together. Or, you could come get plugged in at our next [GroupLink](http://www.watermark.org/connect/singles-grouplink/) once you are ready.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is good to have friends, but it is even better to have a group of people who truly know and accept you, and who are actively concerned with your well-being and helping you grow. That is biblical community, and it is so worth it."},"url":{"en-US":"biblical-community-vs-friends-at-church"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/biblical-community-vs-friends-at-church/"}}},

Sales is a very results-oriented field; you usually get paid based not on the amount of work you do, but on the results you get. It is also pretty easy to track those results and determine whether you were successful; either you made sales, or you didn’t.  \n  \n  \n  \nOf course, ministry is a bit different. I still find myself wanting to measure whether I’ve been “successful,” and work with several business-minded Porch volunteers and staff who are interested in figuring out how to track results. But the obvious things you can track, such as the number of people attending each week, don’t actually matter; attending church doesn’t make you a fully-devoted follower of Jesus any more than attending a baseball game makes you an all-star pitcher.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo how do you measure the success of a ministry? What even constitutes “success”?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Defining Success**  \n  \nThe stated goal of The Porch has always been to help people take that next step of spiritual growth, or become more like Christ. That next step is different for each person, depending on where they are now.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor example, you could group the people in our ministry, or in our local mission field of Dallas young adults, into three categories:\n\n  \n1. Those on the outside or on the fringe of the ministry (who have either never been to The Porch, or have come but are not yet connected in any way).\n  \n2. Those on the inside (who are believers, are coming consistently, and are connected).\n  \n3. Those making it happen (our leaders and volunteers).\n  \n  \nOur focus is to help each of these three groups grow spiritually. For example, a big win is to take someone from the outside (group 1), bring them into the ministry (group 2), and have them join us in ministering to others (group 3). That means we need to be doing at least three things:  \n\n  \n1. For group 1, we have to reach out to them and share the good news, and encourage them to get plugged into a church that will help them grow—whether that be Watermark, or some other local Bible-based church they can connect with.\n  \n2. For group 2, it means teaching them the Bible and providing resources through community groups, equipping classes, recovery ministries, etc.\n  \n3. For group 3, it involves more hands-on leadership and discipleship training, as well as praying with them for the ministry. They are the ones who ultimately serve and grow groups 1 and 2.\n  \n  \nSince we are talking about spiritual growth and life change, I think it is important to remember that _we cannot control that_. I cannot save anyone. I can’t even save myself, and I know this because I’ve tried. God is the One who changes lives; our job is to be faithful in loving Him and [loving others](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-love/). So it is less about counting “sales” and more about measuring whether we are consistently doing 1, 2, and 3 above with a grateful heart.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Success Stories**  \n  \nMeasuring those activities can tell us how well we are doing our jobs. In terms of the overall impact the ministry is having, the best \"measurement\" of growth is, in my opinion, stories. It is not dissimilar to a girl telling and retelling her engagement story. People who love God and love others talk about it, or at least others talk about them.  \n  \n  \n  \nI am blessed to hear crazy stories of life change pretty much every week. It is just what God has chosen to do, and I am thankful for it. We have started taking [some of those stories](http://theporch.wpengine.com/category/our-stories/) and putting them online, to encourage others that change is possible and readily available through Christ.

In a city known for materialism and self-centeredness, this trend appears to fit right in. On the surface that is. But right now [#MyStory](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23mystory&src=hash) is synonymous with #HisStory. It is hundreds of young adults throwing caution to the wind and proclaiming to the world that God changed their stories. #MyStory equals life change.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd we are in good company. How else could a murderer, the chief of sinners become one of the greatest proponents of the gospel? See also Paul. Or the guy who boasted in his visions become a man sent to prison and then raised to lead a nation. See also Joseph. Or how about the guy who lied about knowing Jesus after following Him everywhere and then boldly started The Way, now known as Christianity. See also Peter.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Bible is full of imperfect people who God used to do great things. Their stories became His masterpiece. And He is using young adults in Dallas to start a movement. We are saved by grace because of what Christ did for us on the cross. But He didn't stay dead. He is alive and well. If you know Him, make Him known! He desires to use you for big things. Want to know the most exciting part? #MyStory is all about giving Him glory.

My name’s Luke, and I recently joined Watermark staff out of the corporate world, as Director of Single Men’s Community. My role is to provide opportunities and encouragement to get connected in authentic biblical community. If you’re a guy, not married, and looking to get involved, let me know! Ladies--a great gal named Lindsay Hall is your go-to girl, and you’ll hear more from her soon.  \n  \n  \n  \nCommunity is a big deal to us at Watermark. More importantly, it’s a big deal to God! Todd Wagner preached a sermon in February titled “[Together is Better…](http://www.watermark.org/media/together-is-better-with-god-and-angel-armies/2450/)” and he went as far as to say that if you are not in community, you’re living in sin. That won’t be the focus of this post, but check out the “[one anothers](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community-not-our-idea/)” of Scripture if you’re interested in learning more.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are part of the Watermark church body, we want you to be fully engaged in community. Here are six ways to get started:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Connect @ GroupLink**  \n  \nEvery quarter we kick off new Watermark community groups through GroupLink. This is a fun and friendly four-week process where you’ll meet others, develop natural relationships, and gain knowledge of biblical community. After the four weeks, you’ll be all set in your new community group!  \n  \n  \n  \nTo find out when the next GroupLink starts, or to sign up for it, [click here](http://www.watermark.org/connect/singles-grouplink/).  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are a part of another church body on Sundays, we encourage you to get fully involved in community there. If they don’t offer community, contact us for resources that can help get you started!  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Connect @ Studies**  \n  \nWatermark offers many Bible studies, and learning about God’s Word together is a great way to get connected! Head to [www.watermark.org/ministries](http://www.watermark.org/ministries), and check out things like Benchmark, a class on biblical theology; Summit, our men’s Bible study; Equipped Disciple, a practical class on discipleship; or our Watermark Women study.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Connect @ The Porch**  \n  \nIf you come to The Porch, you know that there are thousands of people there, which might be overwhelming or exciting to you. We encourage you to be bold in initiating with others. To connect with a smaller group of people, join us for Open Community Group after the message, which is a relaxed way to discuss the message and build relationships with others. There’s a group for guys, and another for girls, open to all.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Connect @ Service**  \n  \nServing together is a great way to get to know others. There are many [ministries within Watermark](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/) where you can serve. We also have many partner ministries, both [locally](http://www.watermark.org/serve/external-focus--local/) and [internationally](http://www.watermark.org/serve/external-focus--international/), that impact poverty, families, health, justice, education, and mentoring. Click on the “Serve” link on the ministries you are interested in, and contact them to get started!  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. Connect @ Sports**  \n  \nExercising and competing together builds bonds. Check out the [Watermark Sports](https://www.facebook.com/groups/wmsports) page on Facebook, and jump in! Folks are involved in softball, basketball, soccer, running, cycling, volleyball, ultimate Frisbee, and even a Crossfit-style workout called [ChristFit](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ChristFit/).  \n  \n  \n  \n**6. Connect @ Launch Retreat**  \n  \nOver Labor Day weekend, 700 young adults head out to Sky Ranch for [the biggest party of the year](http://theporch.wpengine.com/launch-2012-in-photos/). It’s a great way to get to know new folks, and we’ll have some special activities for those looking to get into community. Mark your calendars now!  \n  \n  \n  \nOf course, you can do all these things and build a lot of friendships, but still not be connected in authentic community. There can be a big difference!

He’s charged with 8 counts of murder: one third-degree count and 7 of the premeditated, first-degree variety. Sadly, what makes the case stand out is not that he is charged with multiple murders, but that the 7 premeditated counts are for killing newborn babies.  \n  \n  \n  \nRather than reporting on the trial itself, most of the recent media coverage has been about the lack of media coverage. And while that does raise some interesting questions about why it was not considered newsworthy, or how the media decides which stories to cover, there is a deeper question that I have not seen discussed. Namely: should Dr. Gosnell even be charged with murder?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Abortion vs. Murder**  \n  \nDr. Gosnell had an abortion practice. The 7 babies in the case were the result of “botched abortions,” which are more commonly referred to as “births.” Each baby was born alive as a result of the abortion attempt, which is pretty much the opposite of what was intended. The goal of an abortion is to _prevent_ a live birth, not cause it. So, according to testimony, Dr. Gosnell then completed the abortion by taking each living, breathing, crying baby and (graphic content warning) using scissors to cut through the spinal cord in the back of the neck.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs horrific as that is, Gosnell’s logic was pretty sound. He was getting paid to kill babies, and most of the time was successful at doing so within the womb (or by causing the babies to be born before they could survive outside it). According to most of society, that is perfectly acceptable, to the point of providing public funding for it and staunchly defending the “right” to do it. So what’s the difference, really, in doing the same thing with the baby outside the womb? It’s the same exact baby, simply moved a few inches, and with the killing delayed a few minutes.  \n  \n  \n  \nGosnell has probably killed thousands of such babies over a decades-long career. But he is not on trial for any of those thousands. Even if he were, the worst they could charge him with for those thousands of successful abortions is that many were done later in the pregnancy than the 6-month legal limit. But that’s not a murder charge. That’s not a capital punishment or life-behind-bars type of crime. Yet by doing the same thing to those 7 while they were outside the mother’s body, he gets 7 charges of first-degree murder.  \n  \n  \n  \n**A Matter of Choice**  \n  \nThat’s just hugely inconsistent. Cutting up a live baby inside the mother’s body is no less horrific than doing so outside the woman’s body a few seconds later. It is fundamentally the same thing, and should carry essentially the same punishment—or lack thereof.  \n  \n  \n  \nShould Dr. Gosnell be on trial for murder? I would say absolutely he should, and hopefully you agree. But we need to answer the question of why our country holds him accountable for only 7 of those deaths. Is it just because the other deaths are hidden, visible only to the doctor, and therefore easier for us to ignore? Or, if you think it is OK to kill a baby just before birth, then why wouldn’t you be just fine with what Dr. Gosnell did to those babies moments after their birth?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Be Free**  \n  \nIf you have been part of an abortion yourself, listen closely: God loves you. We don’t have to be OK with murder in order to justify our own actions, because God forgives fully. He even offers full forgiveness to Kermit Gosnell. We are all sinners in need of a Savior.

Feeling that I had no control over my life, I began to starve myself starting at age 12. Knowing I could control what I ate gave me a sense of accomplishment that I could not get anywhere else. I went from 125 lbs. (a healthy weight for my height at the time) to only 95 lbs, at which point I was hospitalized.  \n  \n  \n  \nI attended a highly challenging private school in Dallas, where I struggled to meet my mom’s expectations academically. I remember bringing home a paper that I had gotten a \"D\" on, crying because I was upset about my grade. My mom told me that I was a disgrace to the family, and asked me how I thought God feels when I consistently throw away the opportunity He gave me to go to such a wonderful school. It was then that I knew I could NEVER please my mother, and that God must hate me. So, I decided to hate Him too.  \n  \n  \n  \nI started doing drugs: ecstasy, acid, weed, and my personal favorite, cocaine. I never had money for rent because of this, so I had to live on my friend’s couch. All of these drugs were filling the hole where I had taken God out of my heart.  \n  \n  \n  \nI don’t know how to explain this without saying that God was taking care of me, but after a year of heavy drug use, God woke me up. He opened my eyes that this was not the life I was meant to live. I wanted to have a future and a family, and every day I was on drugs I was losing that real purpose for my life. So I quit drugs, cold turkey.  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, I still didn’t really turn to God, and denied Him control over my life. And when it came to relationships, I could have been the poster child for what a girl with “daddy issues” would look like. I searched for love from guys, and each guy I dated (and especially the ones I slept with) fulfilled my deep need for love that I didn’t get from a father at home.  \n  \n  \n  \nOne day, I found out that I was pregnant—and nearly 4 months pregnant. Again, here is where I CANNOT deny that God was taking care of me: on the very day my child had been conceived, I had quit smoking and drinking because I simply “didn’t feel like it” (my exact words) anymore. I still had to face the consequences of my actions, but I also had to acknowledge that I had been entrusted with a GIFT who I knew was meant to be on this earth because God had protected her. My child, my wake-up call, my story of grace.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod used this consequence of a decision I had made to make me realize that there is hope found in Him. While I was pregnant, I prayed that God would use my story, my daughter, and myself for His glory, and HE HAS! He sent my daughter (16 months old at the time) and I to Guatemala for 2 months on a mission trip. I got to see God use my story and past mistakes to reach many Guatemalan girls, and even my crazy outgoing daughter impacted the women there because she accepted and loved them without reservation. What a great God we have to use some of the smallest things, including children who can barely speak a few words, for His glory.  \n  \n  \n  \nAfter getting involved in Watermark, and now leading a community group, I am so humbled by my fellow sisters in Christ and cherish spending life with them and this body of believers. I cannot express how much it means to be reminded daily that WE are the hands and feet of Christ. Because Christ died on the cross for my sins, which is pure love, I am now commanded to love and serve others the way He loved and served and SAVED me on the cross."},"url":{"en-US":"always-taking-care-of-me"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/always-taking-care-of-me/"}}},

And, if I’m honest, I think I might have had similar questions when I first attended Watermark in 2010. I heard everyone talking about community and their own personal experience with their community group and I couldn’t help but wonder, “what’s the big deal about community?! I have my friends…[isn’t that enough](http://theporch.wpengine.com/biblical-community-vs-friends-at-church/)?”  \n  \n  \n  \nThe hope and mission of community at Watermark is to connect people into authentic relationships that lead to spiritual transformation. However, we didn’t come up with this concept on our own; it’s a principle given to us directly from the Bible. That’s why we believe it is important, and that is where we find it defined and described. Some examples from Scripture:  \n  \n  \n  \n**We are called to accountability.**  \n  \n_Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective. – James 5:16_  \n  \n_As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another. — Proverbs 27:17_  \n  \n_He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ. —Colossians 1:28_  \n  \n  \n  \n**We are called to encourage one another.**  \n  \n_Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing. — 1 Thessalonians 5:11_  \n  \n_But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness. — Hebrews 3:13_  \n  \n  \n  \n**We are called to live life in humility.**  \n  \n_Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. —Romans 12:10_  \n  \n_Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God. — Romans 15:7_  \n  \n_Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. — Philippians 2:3-4_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Community is modeled for us in Scripture.**  \n  \n_They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles. All the believers were together and had everything in common. They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved. — Acts 2:42-47_  \n  \n  \n  \n_Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other. And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone. — 1 Thessalonians 5:12-14_  \n  \n  \n  \n_Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up…Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken. — Ecclesiastes 4:9-10, 12_  \n  \n  \n  \nYou’ll notice that in all of those passages, we are called to do life with others because it is _for our own good!_  \n  \n  \n  \nMy life, walk with the Lord, and views on community have been radically transformed in the past 3 years. ([You can read more about my own transformation here.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/circle-of-trust/)) I get so excited to report that _mine_ is not the only life that I’ve seen change when making the choice to dive in, head-first, into living out and following these principles! So many of **_you_** are also choosing to live a life of authenticity with one another for the sake of the gospel to be lived out in your lives!  \n  \n  \n  \nLiving life in community and following the commands of these Scriptures isn’t always easy…sometimes [it gets messy](http://theporch.wpengine.com/loving-the-messy-bits/). I can tell you, though, that living life in biblical community has been so worth it.  \n  \n  \n  \nI am so thankful that God has made us in such a way that requires us to need one another in order to experience more fullness in Him. We were never intended to journey alone.  \n  \n  \n  \nP.S.

It is a story [written by God](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm%20139:16&version=NIV), and He can use it to reach and save others. But to do so, the story must be told.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou don’t have to be good at sharing your testimony for it to be effective, because God can work with anything. But being good at it doesn’t hurt, either. If nothing else, knowing how to share your story will make you more confident and comfortable in doing so, so you will do it more often.  \n  \n  \n  \nTo help, here are 10 tips on how to tell your story:\n\n  \n1. **Have a story to tell.** You can’t really be a witness to something you haven’t seen. If you have never heard or understood the gospel, don’t know what will happen after you die, or think that you can get into heaven by being good enough: stop reading right here and [call or email me](http://www.watermark.org/about-us/our-team/jonathan-jp-pokluda/) now.\n  \n2. **Divide it into three parts.** Almost all stories use a [three-act structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure). For your testimony, the three acts are:  \n\n  \n  - Your life before Christ. This sets up the problem, which is that you are sinful and need saving.\n  \n  - Christ. Explains how and why you came to trust in Jesus for salvation.\n  \n  - Your life since Christ. This explains how things are different as a result.\n  \n  \n  \n3. **Be open.** There is a huge power in talking openly about your past mistakes, especially major ones. The person you are talking to has issues just as big as yours and needs to know that anyone can be saved regardless of what they have done.\n  \n4. **Be honest.** After being saved, you now live life perfectly, right? Of course not. Don’t give the impression that being a Christian is about being perfect and never again sinning. They might miss the point and think that they just have to go behave themselves, or think that they could never be saved because they can never be as perfect as you.\n  \n5. **Make sure Jesus is the hero.** Every good story has a hero. You are not the hero; you are the damsel in distress. Don’t turn it into “I overcame” or “I figured it out.” Even your strength and abilities are gifts from God.\n  \n6. **Share the gospel.** In act two of your story, you hear and accept the gospel. Make sure you include what that good news was in your retelling.\n  \n7. **Avoid Christianese.** Were you washed in the blood of the lamb? I hope not, because that would be disgusting. It is a metaphor that only works with people who know the meaning behind it. And the propitiatory atonement—just stop. Use CNN language, not church-speak.\n  \n8. **Keep it short.** Or shortish. Your life story is really long, and you don’t have to [tell them everything](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5UG7ISJfP0). Different situations call for different levels of detail, and your testimony could be as long as _War and Peace_ or as short as [132 characters](http://theporch.wpengine.com/mystory-2/). But most of the time it needs to be 3 minutes or less.\n  \n9. **Make it relevant.** Part of keeping it short is choosing what to cut out and what to leave in. Leave in the parts that your audience will be most likely to relate with personally.\n  \n10. **Pray.** Do this now, before you ever tell your story. Pray that [God will give you the words to say](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:11-12&version=NIV) when that time comes and that He will use your story to change someone’s eternity. Only He can do that; our job is just to be faithful in the telling.\n  \n  \n[Have a story to tell](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

Write a blog. Reply to 236 emails. Invest in relationships. [Do community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/). Bear burdens. Care for the one in your path. Write a sermon. Manage the team. Plan events. Invest in leaders. Dream big. Pay bills. Lead your family. Disciple your children. Pray. Be still….  \n  \n  \n  \nI'm tired. I've heard BUSY is an acronym for “Being Under Satan's Yoke,” and I am starting to believe it. Often the week feels like I wake up and I run, until I am back at my bed where I sleep, so that I can wake up and run tomorrow. And people must see it on me, because lately every email starts with \"I know you're busy but…\" So, somehow people know I am busy, now what do I do about it?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Filling the Jar**  \n  \nI have a hunch that the urgent things are choking out the absolutely necessary things. Recently, I read a story in an email forward that illustrated this. A teacher filled a jar with golf-ball-sized rocks and asked the class if it was full, to which they replied \"yes.\" Then the teacher added tiny BBs, which filled the empty spaces between the rocks, and again asked the class if it was full. They responded \"yes\" again. This continued with sand and then liquid until all the \"free\" space in the jar was truly occupied.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe lesson taught from the illustration is to make sure the big commitments go into your schedule first, and then you can put the less important things that come up into the gaps. Do the unimportant things first, and you won’t be able to fit in the “big rocks.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**Priorities vs. Necessities**  \n  \nIn the past, I have erred by simply prioritizing my big commitments. The priority list looks like:\n\n  \n1. God\n  \n2. Family\n  \n3. Community\n  \n4. Work\n  \n  \nWhile I believe that setting priorities is a great practice, it is also an incomplete one. There can be a lot of overlap in those \"categories.\" If you are in vocational ministry, then \"work\" looks a lot like it could go in the \"God\" category and take precedence over everything else—as it sometimes does for me. Also, if work is providing for your family, doesn't that make some \"deposits\" into the family category? But if I focus on work to the detriment of the other areas, that is _not_ honoring to my family or to God.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, rather than a list of priorities, I'd encourage you to look at these 4 categories as all _necessities_. You can’t let one monopolize time away from the others, or devalue one because it seems a little less important. These are the “big rocks.”  \n  \n  \n  \nHow are you doing at taking care of those 4 things? Below are some questions that can help you evaluate and make the most of your time in each area.  \n  \n  \n  \n**God:**  \n\n  \n- How do you connect with God? (What are you doing when you feel closest to Him?)\n  \n- How can you make sure that you do this regularly?\n  \n- Is it easier for you to pray, or to study the Bible?\n  \n- How can you make sure that both are a daily part of your disciplines? (Having a place, a specific time, and length of time will help.)\n  \n  \n**Family:**  \n\n  \n- What does the way you love your family say about your relationship with God?\n  \n- How does your family say you are doing at loving them?\n  \n- Do you have good boundaries?\n  \n- Are their expectations aligned with these boundaries?\n  \n  \n**Community:**  \n\n  \n- How do you prioritize meeting with a consistent small group of Christians for the purpose of accountability, decision making, and spiritual growth?\n  \n- How are you doing at bearing the burdens of others in your group?\n  \n- How often do you ask each other about time-management, priorities, and boundaries?\n  \n- How does your community say you are doing at prioritizing and balancing these 4 categories?\n  \n  \n**Work:**  \n\n  \n- How would your co-workers describe your work ethic?\n  \n- How does your faith, family, and community invade your time at work?\n  \n- How does your work invade your faith, family and community?\n  \n- What is the maximum number of hours each week (including travel) that you are willing to work?\n  \n  \nI've found that honest answers to these questions help manage the overlap and keep our focus on the absolutely necessary things.  \n  \n  \n  \nAlmost everyone drifts to spending the majority of their time in one of the categories, and sadly it is almost never \"God.\" Sometimes, it is not even one of the “big rocks” at all. We each need to know what we are tempted to let dominate, be constantly aware of how we are doing, and not let anything push out any of the big rocks.  \n  \n  \n\n  \n- What are you tempted to let dominate your schedule?\n  \n- How do urgent things take priority over the \"big rocks\"?\n  \n- What can you do to readjust and balance these 4 categories?\n  \n  \n- JP"},"url":{"en-US":"busyness-and-the-big-rocks"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/busyness-and-the-big-rocks/"}}},

What’s become apparent is that Dzhokar lived a total double life, where the persona he displayed—of a well-rounded sportsman with a steady temperament—was completely different from the darkness inside of him.  \n  \n  \n  \nHe “kept much of his inner life secret.” He was a “master of concealment.” He was “a skilled deflector of curiosity about his personal affairs.”  \n  \n  \n  \n“To even his closest friends, [he] was a smart, athletic 19-year-old with a barbed wit and a laid-back demeanor...They seldom, if ever, saw his second, almost watertight life: his disintegrating family, his overbearing brother, the gathering blackness in his most private moments.”  \n  \n  \n  \nForget for a moment that we are talking about an accused bomber, and the quotes above might start to sound familiar; at times, most of us have probably tried to hide certain truths about our lives. Are there parts of your life that you keep tightly locked down, never sharing with anyone? Is there any darkness in you that you’re hesitant to expose to the light? Are you afraid that people might reject you if they knew who you really are and what you’re really struggling with?  \n  \n  \n  \n**My Story**  \n  \nAs you can [read about in my story here](http://theporch.wpengine.com/thought-i-had-it-all-together/), I know what it’s like to walk in darkness with no community or accountability, all the while making it look like I had everything together. The results were destructive to me and to my relationship with God. As Proverbs 28:13a says, “Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper…”  \n  \n  \n  \nThankfully, God’s Word provides the ultimate light to counter our desire to hide sin.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Unmasking in Community**  \n  \nEphesians 5:11 says to “have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.” Being involved with biblical community helps us follow this command. What better way to expose the darkness and sin within us than to confess it to other believers who know and love us, and who want the best for us? As James 5:16 says, “Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed…”  \n  \n  \n  \nDon’t hide your junk, only to be exposed when it comes out in the form of spiritual, emotional, or possibly even physical damage to yourself or others. Take the courageous step of letting yourself be known, sin and all. If you don’t feel like doing that, you may do well to heed the sobering warning that God gave Israel in Numbers 32:23b: “you may be sure that your sin will find you out.”  \n  \n  \n  \nPraise God that when we do confess and expose our sin, He is faithful to forgive us and purify us from it ([1 John 1:9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A9&version=NIV))! As Proverbs 28:13b goes on to say: “…the one who confesses and renounces [their sins] finds mercy.”  \n  \n  \n  \nLooking to take the next step of getting involved in biblical community?

Four years ago when I [heard Jesus knocking at the door](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3%3A20&version=NIV) and dared to open it so that He might come in, I had no idea the wild ride ahead. Since then He’s taken me all over the world, to the worst parts of my city, to the darkest parts of corporate America, and even to the deepest parts of my soul. Constantly lighting the path a few steps ahead. Asking me, inviting me, to be a part of something bigger than myself.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd now here I find myself being directed toward the issue of women being bought and sold for sex.  \n  \n  \n  \n27 million in slavery. A 32 billion dollar industry. Women kidnapped, coerced, manipulated, abused, beaten, raped, sold. No media coverage. No public outrage. A muted and largely apathetic church.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s an overwhelming problem; seemingly without solution. The world tells us there’s little we can do. No laws will end it. No number of social workers will be enough. Men will still demand it. Women will be abused. Evil will prevail.  \n  \n  \n  \n**But there is good news. And His name is Jesus.**  \n  \n  \n  \nNo problem is too big for Him, and as I’ve dared to trust Him with each step on this journey, I’ve glimpsed the beautiful story He’s been writing.  \n  \n  \n  \n**I first see His pen moving across the page** within my own community group. Sitting in a circle on the floor, sharing what we’re learning and reading and one of us starts to cry. Not about the pain in her own life, but the lives of the women she’s starting to get to know. She’s volunteering at a women’s shelter and in the process learning more about the trafficking world. The pain, the torture, the feelings of worthlessness that come with it. This friend is heartbroken and determined to devote her foreseeable future to making this atrocity right.  \n  \n  \n  \n**A few months later I see Him moving** in the animated and ambitious plans of a mother of three. Jesus has given her a vision for a better world and she has spent years working towards it. Her enthusiasm is contagious as we brainstorm and dream for hours in a coffee shop. Dinner time comes and goes, and still we are there…our stomachs rumbling as our spirits crave a better life for women everywhere.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Weeks later the story continues** in a meeting with a former prostitute in aftercare programming. We chuckle together as she asks me if I have recently come out of the sex industry myself. Jesus’ voice speaks boldly through her and as I hear Him talking, it’s a message of restored worth and value. He has made her radiant.  \n  \n  \n  \n**And a week ago the plot unfolds further** as I find myself and my friend driving the streets of Dallas with a trafficking investigator. As she points out locations known for solicitation or enslavement, others in our group turn the conversation towards finding a solution. Stricter laws? Better prevention programs? More funding? As hopelessness is passed around the group, I see a glimmer in my friend’s eye.  \n  \n  \n  \nJesus, she says. He can solve it.  \n  \n  \n  \nChurch, we have a powerful Bridegroom. A God who [transforms lives](http://theporch.wpengine.com/category/our-stories/). Not through a list of morals or rules, or with money and laws, but through personal relationships. And when it comes to trafficking, we have a hope that the world doesn’t because we know the solution.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Jesus is writing something beautiful.** He is sending the light of the world into the darkest parts of our cities. He is restoring infinite value to those who have been sold for a price. He is reminding Johns and clients that they were made for something greater. He is rescuing pimps and traffickers from the evil that’s controlling them.  \n  \n  \n  \n**I dare you to join Him**. Allow Him to use you in His story of redemption and transformation. Catch His vision for that woman being sold, for that man paying for her, and for that pimp placing a price tag on her soul. He died for them. And He wants to make sure they know it.  \n  \n  \n  \nDon’t know where to start? [Come to The Porch tonight](http://theporch.wpengine.com/contact/). Come and see and be a part of the story being written.  \n  \n  \n  \nThese are our beautiful beginnings, church. As Christ's bride awakens, His story will get louder. The pages He’s already written will be multiplied. And the world will stop and see how great is our God."},"url":{"en-US":"ending-sex-trafficking-the-beginning-of-something-beautiful"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/ending-sex-trafficking-the-beginning-of-something-beautiful/"}}},

You’ve heard the term thrown around occasionally, or heard of specific instances such as the [recent rescue of three girls in Cleveland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Cleveland,_Ohio,_missing_trio). Maybe you’ve heard about it through Louie Giglio and the [END IT movement](http://enditmovement.com/). Or, like most of us, you may have been educated on it primarily from Liam Neesen, his \"very particular set of skills,\" and the movie _Taken_.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut what does it actually mean? What does it actually look like? And what can we do to be a part of the solution?  \n  \n  \n  \n**What is Sex Trafficking?**  \n  \nSex trafficking is the organized coercion of unwilling people into different sexual practices, including strip clubs, pornography, massage parlors, street prostitution, and escort services.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt can take many forms. Much of it does involve people being kidnapped (or sold by family members) and then often shipped to another country, which is not fundamentally different than the slave trade of 200 years ago.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut it can also include women or men involved in prostitution or pornography who we think chose that lifestyle. One has to consider why anyone would actually _choose_ such a thing, and realize that it is most likely a result of either coercion or a _lack_ of choice.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Sex Trafficking Statistics**  \n  \nSex slavery is a terrible crime on the individual level. A single case, when brought to the public’s attention, inspires shock and outrage. But we are not dealing with isolated incidents.  \n  \n  \n  \nConsider:\n\n  \n- In the U.S. alone, sex trafficking is a $9.8 billion industry. That means it is _larger than the NFL_.\n  \n- Worldwide, slavery is a $32 billion industry. That is more than the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS, and NASCAR _combined_.\n  \n- There are 27 million slaves worldwide right now. That is more slaves than there were back before the Civil War. It is more slaves than there has ever been before in the history of the world.\n  \n- The average age of a new sex slave is about 13 years old. _Average_. Which means for every 18-year-old, there is an 8-year-old (or multiple 11- or 12-year-olds).\n  \n- One out of every five cases of child trafficking in this country occurs in Texas.\n  \n  \nThe scope of the problem, and the evil that it represents, can be difficult to comprehend. We don’t want to even think about it. But we must do something about it.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Solution**  \n  \nNo matter how complicated or unsolvable the problem may seem, we have a Savior that can overcome all of it. As His church we have the opportunity, calling, and mission to bring His light into the dark world. So how do we do it?  \n  \n  \n  \nEven if you don’t have Liam Neeson’s particular set of skills, you can make a real difference. [God has already prepared you with the skills you need](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A10&version=NIV). Below are some specific, concrete things you can do about it.  \n\n  \n- **First off, don’t be part of the problem.** Ah, things just got a little awkward. You may be helping supply the market for sex trafficking. If you are a consumer of pornography, strip clubs, or any version of sex-as-a-product, you are not currently part of the solution. You are part of the problem. There is forgiveness for that, no matter what form you may have taken part in. But stop. Eliminate the demand, and there will be no profit in the supply.\n  \n- **Do you have a heart for justice?** Consider joining [Ministries 101](http://www.ministries101.org/) or [Restart 133](http://restart133.tumblr.com/) as they minister to incarcerated women.\n  \n- **Want to make sure at risk women don’t fall into the trap of prostitution?** Consider working with [Interfaith Housing Coalition](http://www.ihcdallas.org/) and [Exodus Ministries](http://www.exodusministriesdallas.org/) as they help families and women transition from homelessness or prison back into society.\n  \n- **Do you like kids?** If so, consider mentoring a child in West Dallas through [Mercy Street](http://mercystreetdallas.org/).You can help prevent at-risk kids from falling into the trafficking trap by simply caring about them, discipling them, and pointing them in the right direction.\n  \n- **Want to be involved directly in bringing Jesus to this problem?** [Jesus Said Love](http://www.jesussaidlove.com/JesusSaidLove/DALLAS_Home.html) and [New Friends, New Life](http://www.newfriendsnewlife.org/) provide outreach and aftercare to women in the sex industry and would love your help.\n  \n- **Spread the word.** Let others know there is a problem and encourage them to get involved. Feel free to share this post, if that helps.\n  \n- **Most importantly, pray.** [Click here to see our prayer guide on the issue.](http://theporchdallas.com/sex-trafficking-prayer-guide) Or join us next Tuesday, May 21, in the in the chapel after The Porch for a time of corporate prayer.\n  \n  \nYou don’t have to do it alone. If everyone at The Porch and everyone reading this right now committed to taking part, we would have an army literally thousands strong. And instead of Liam Neeson’s fictional _Taken_ character, we have the real-world Aslan backing us up.  \n  \n  \n  \n[This can be the beginning of the end.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/ending-sex-trafficking-the-beginning-of-something-beautiful/)  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you have questions, please contact us [ThePorch@watermark.org](mailto:ThePorch@watermark.org).  \n  \n  \n  \n**#NotInOurCity** "},"url":{"en-US":"sex-trafficking-the-problem-and-the-solution"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/sex-trafficking-the-problem-and-the-solution/"}}},

Though most people think of it as something that was a problem 200 years ago, slavery, and specifically sex trafficking, is a bigger problem now than ever before.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe encouraged people to be a part of [the solution to this problem](http://theporch.wpengine.com/sex-trafficking-the-problem-and-the-solution/). One thing we don’t want to do is get people all riled up about a problem for a day or a week, and maybe even take action, but then quickly forget about it.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Insta-life**  \n  \nPeople today, and especially those of us in [Generation Y](http://theporch.wpengine.com/generation-why-statistics/), value the instant. Instant gratification, instant fame, instant success. I mean, if you’re not an internet billionaire by the time you’re 30, what have you been doing with your life?  \n  \n  \n  \nIn reality, though, it hardly ever works that way. And since we are generally impatient, we lose interest when we don’t see instant results. We quit, and move on to our next get-this-quick scheme. It highlights both the best and worst qualities of our generation: we think we can [change the world](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-change-the-world/), but we totally lack the commitment to do so.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe overestimate what we can accomplish in a short period of time, which causes us to try and then fail. And we underestimate what we could get done if we faithfully pursued something for a long period of time, which causes us to fail by not trying.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe sad part is, we are right about that whole “change the world” bit. History is full of young adults who did exactly that, without the benefit of iPhones and Twitter.  \n  \n  \n  \n**An Example**  \n  \nTake [William Wilberforce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wilberforce), who lived in London 200 years ago (1759—1833) when slavery was still legal. Though religious as a kid, by college he was known as a party animal who cared little for studying (sound familiar?). A few years after college he returned to the faith and truly decided to follow Jesus wholeheartedly, even though at the time being an outspoken Christian was frowned upon in local society (sound familiar?). And then some friends opened his eyes to the huge problem of slavery and human trafficking, and he felt convicted that he had to do something about it (sound familiar?).  \n  \n  \n  \nSo at age 28, he started a campaign against the slave trade, which at the time was legal and a big business—worth 80 percent of the country’s foreign income. He gathered evidence and allies, gave impassioned 4-hour speeches (man after my own heart), and presented a bill to parliament.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich failed. By a 2-to-1 margin.  \n  \n  \n  \n_This is where the story stops sounding familiar._   \n  \n  \n  \nMost of us would have quit, and nothing more would have come of it. But Wilberforce tried again the next year. And failed. So he tried again the next year. And failed. So he tried again the next year. And failed. So he tried again…well, you get the picture. He was faithful to what God had called him to, and had placed on his heart.  \n  \n  \n  \nAfter 20 years of effort, he tried yet again…and succeeded. The slave trade was abolished. So he turned to the practice of slavery itself, and after 26 more years it was abolished throughout the British Empire. This was in 1833, three decades before it was outlawed in the U.S.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Only 46 Years**  \n  \nNow, if you read that and think, “Man, 46 years? Ain’t nobody got time for that!” then you are missing the point. The guy changed his country. He took on Big Business, the status quo, and the law, and he won. It resulted in 800,000 people being freed from a lifetime of slavery. And it only took him 46 years.  \n  \n  \n  \nStart now. Many people wait too long and then don’t have 46 years left to spend. But that is the power of being a young adult: you literally have the time.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe ones who tried one thing, failed, and then went on to try and fail at other things? We don’t talk about them 200 years later. And the ones who spent 46 solid years pursuing wealth, power, and fame? We don’t talk about those either. The key is to focus on what is truly important and _be faithful_.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat are you devoting your life to?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"the-power-of-being-faithful"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-power-of-being-faithful/"}}},

Shane & Shane. Well, we’re pretty creative people, so, I was like, “Hey. Your name is Shane. My name is Shane. Let’s just introduce a new word to it: 'And.'” And there you had it.\n\n  \n  \n\nBarnard: Shaned? I always wanted it to be “Shaned.”\n\n  \n  \n  \n**What is your favorite Shane & Shane song?**  \n  \n  \n\nBarnard: Right now I like a song called “You Loved My Heart to Death.” It’s a newer song. But, I’m sure it’ll change in about a month. As far as Shane & Shane songs go, none of them are that great, so you have to move on pretty fast.\n\n  \n  \n\nEverett: Probably my favorite Shane & Shane song of all time is \"Psalm 145.\" Just because I love that Scripture. And I feel like that’s what we do: we just commend His Kingdom to one another. So that’s why I like it.\n\n  \n  \n  \n**Which one of you is the best songwriter?**  \n  \n  \n\nEverett: Hmm. Best songwriter. I’ve written two songs, so…\n\n  \n  \n\nBarnard: Those were great songs, though.\n\n  \n  \n\nEverett: Out of the two that I have written, I would say, probably the best...\n\n  \n  \n\nBarnard: They were amazing. Actually, they were. One of them was amazing.\n\n  \n  \n\nEverett: It was called “Amazing.”\n\n  \n  \n\nBarnard: Yeah. It was “Amazing.”\n\n  \n  \n\nEverett: I really have written five or six songs.\n\n  \n  \n  \n**Which one is the best bus driver?**  \n  \n  \n\nBarnard: Maybe the better question is, who is more likely to hit something? I would say Shane is.\n\n  \n  \n\nEverett: You’ve hit more things than I have! I’ve just hit one—I’ve hit a bigger thing than you.\n\n  \n  \n  \n**What was the big thing?**  \n  \n  \n\nEverett: I hit a car. But you hit a car! He’s hit a car, he’s hit a mountain…\n\n  \n  \n  \n**Well, that’s bigger.**  \n  \n  \n\nBarnard:I hit a car and a mountain. The car was minimal. It was very minimal. I paid him off with 200 bucks.\n\n  \n  \n\nEverett: No, that was a bus. But you hit another car in Nashville turning the corner.\n\n  \n  \n\nBarnard: No, that’s what I’m talking about.\n\n  \n  \n\nEverett: Oh, I thought you were talking about hitting the car in Winnie.\n\n  \n  \n\nBarnard: Oh, no, the one in Nashville, I paid him off with 200 bucks.

Uhhhruff. Uhhhhhhruff.”\n\n  \n  \n\nEverett: That’s hard to write.\n\n  \n  \n\nBarnard: Because a deer goes “uhhhhr.” And then a dog goes “ruff.” So it goes “uhhhruff.”\n\n  \n  \n\nEverett: Favorite kind of animal. Might be a lion, man.\n\n  \n  \n\nBarnard: Not your favorite kind of animal.

A lion. For sure.\n\n  \n  \n  \n**Why?**  \n  \n  \n\nEverett: Why? Because they’re awesome. Top of the food chain. King of the jungle. Manes.\n\n  \n  \n\nBarnard: Manes?\n\n  \n  \n\nEverett: Very full manes.\n\n  \n  \n  \n**You wish you could grow a mane?**  \n  \n  \n\nEverett: I wouldn’t mind…\n\n  \n  \n\nBarnard: Take your shirt off. Take it off. Take it off, man.\n\n  \n  \n\nEverett: I can’t—a mane’s on the head. My mane’s falling out. My mane is falling out.\n\n  \n  \n  \n**Describe your new album.**  \n  \n  \n\nBarnard: It is just really another attempt to preach the gospel. The title of it is “Bring Your Nothing,” and it’s really another way to say the gospel of grace. We bring nothing. He gives us everything. It’s just a collection of songs trying to communicate the best way we can the grace that God has shown us, and the grace that’s offered in Christ Jesus.\n\n  \n  \n  \n**What made you choose The Porch?**  \n  \n  \n\nEverett: We’ve loved Watermark for a long time. And so we’ve watched from afar. And even when Todd went to start Watermark, we helped out a little bit. Back in the early years at the high school. Years and years ago. And through the Lord’s providence, He just kind of linked our hearts back up over the past year and a half or so. And we began making the transition. We’re so excited to come be a part of what the Lord was doing here at the church and The Porch. We felt like it was a really good option for us to be involved locally, and really felt the Lord leading us here. And we're excited to be a part of the church, not just The Porch, but excited to be part of the church, and the family here, and just really felt really encouraged by the staff. Man, we love it.\n\n  \n  \n  \nShane & Shane lead worship at The Porch each Tuesday.

My dad was attempting to kidnap me at gun point and I could see my mom in the rear view running toward us, trying to save me.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat day remains vivid in my mind and is the starting point of several crumbling life choices, traumatic experiences, and a total loss of my sense of security: alcoholism, inappropriate relationships with men, abortions, defining my identity in relationships, codependency, physical abuse, partying…I literally did it all. But that was before Christ. Before Jesus, I lived for myself, searching for life where only death could be found. In my eyes God was for those who already had their lives together. I, very visibly, did not.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Nowhere Else to Turn**  \n  \nSo there I was going through yet another traumatic, dramatic breakup from an unhealthy, codependent relationship. It was then that God allowed me to hit rock bottom. I was alone, unable to function on a daily basis, and, for the first time, experiencing panic attacks—no longer confident in who I was. I had friends, fun, everything that is supposed to make you happy but I was not, and was barely functioning on a day-to-day basis. Because she could tell I was circling the drain, my mom visited and suggested we go to church—a rare occurrence in my family—so, feeling utterly numb and hopeless, I agreed. What could it hurt? I had nowhere else to turn. We visited The Rock, a nondenominational Christian church in San Diego where I was living at the time. The only thing I can remember from the experience is that there was suddenly an extremely refreshing peace that came over me. In all of my chaos, God comforted me.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Leaving Lukewarm Behind**  \n  \nAfter that, I had one foot in the church but still kept one foot in the world. I was still not living for God, and still maintaining inappropriate relationships until I moved to Dallas and my aunt suggested I check out a young adult ministry at her church—The Porch. JP challenged us to give up your “playground and playmates” and it suddenly hit me what I needed to do to turn my life around. It was at The Porch that I learned that Jesus died for all of my sin; He made me new and I didn’t have to be “clean” to come to Him. With Christ I could have life; not this half-in, half-out world in which I was living. I didn’t need to be ashamed of my parents or my abortions or my drinking or my inappropriate relationships. In God is where I belong. Ephesians 4:22-24 encourages us to pursue a new life in Him. “You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**God’s Transformation in Me**  \n  \nGod has since begun a transformation in me. I am focused on Him, attend The Porch every Tuesday, joined a community group, and am now a member of Watermark. I recently completed Equipped Disciple 2 and am seeking recovery from my abortions through the Someone Cares ministry. I am running toward Christ with other believers and finding security in Him.  \n  \n  \n  \nHis Word guides me, and helps me when I am weak. Jeremiah 29:11 says, “‘For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm to you, plans to give you hope and a future.’” When I doubt, I lean on this verse, so much so that I’ve had it painted on a canvas in my room so that I can be reminded daily of His faithfulness. I’ve never been so joyful and felt so much peace in my entire life. I am finally striving for the kind of life God wants from me—one fully devoted to Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

On a lot of things, it seems. And waiting can be really hard, particularly when it does not end when or how I had hoped.  \n  \n  \n  \nRecently, I got a very clear \"no\" on something I'd been waiting on and praying about for a long time. It was easy to pray for God's will months ago, but once I realized His will didn't look exactly like what I wanted it to, things got a little trickier. Just when I thought my waiting was coming to an end, I had to face the facts that more was headed my way.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhile meeting with my community group on Monday night, we went around the circle sharing our updates from the week and how God had been speaking to us, like we do every week. Suddenly, it hit me. **We're all waiting!** Whether it's job stuff, relationship stuff, school stuff, family stuff, future stuff, or on and on the list could go, each of us in that circle has something (or some things) in our life that we are just plain waiting on. It may span a broad spectrum, but the core is ultimately the same. And suddenly, I felt a weight lifted.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy favorite C.S. Lewis quote says, **\"Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: 'What! You too? I thought I was the only one.'\"** With this quote, I think Lewis paints a pretty great picture of how community can/should be oftentimes. One of Satan's favorite tools when trying to destroy us is attempting to make us feel as isolated as possible. As if you are the only one who could ever possibly understand what you're going through, whatever it is.  \n  \n  \n  \nMany times, when I hear the word _encouragement_, I envision people saying things like, \"You can do it!\" and \"I'm praying for you.\" But that Monday night, I was reminded of the encouragement found in going through life with people who genuinely understand what you're going through. If I have to go through hard times (which I do; [Luke 9:23](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+9%3A23&version=NIV) kind of promises this), then I'm glad I have women by my side fighting similar battles. The key is recognizing that healing and freedom begin with confession ([James 5:16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+5%3A16&version=NIV)). In other words, [being an open book](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community-unmasking-the-dark-side/) with your community leads to those moments when you realize you're not so alone after all. From there, the trials you're facing somehow seem less daunting.  \n  \n  \n  \nEcclesiastes 4:9-10 says that \"Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.\" What a great encouragement to know that when I fall, I have six wonderful friends ready to help me back up and remind me that I'm not alone.  \n  \n  \n  \nAre you [connected in community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/plugging-in-six-ways-to-get-connected-in-community/)?

A family friend gave us their piano, and that is where I first discovered my love of music. This passion soon became my obsession and my escape.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs I grew in my skill and ability, people would comment and say encouraging things about how God had gifted me. I began to think that since God had gifted me in music, it must have been because He wanted me to pursue a life and career in music. While it is true that God gifted me for a purpose, I was mistaken in the thought that the “purpose” was mine to decide. Looking back I can see that I had the wrong view of God. I saw Him as Creator and Savior—I had that part right—but I had missed the most important part: He is also Lord.  \n  \n  \n  \n**My Way**  \n  \nNot once did I ever stop to ask God what He would have me do with my life. At first, it never crossed my mind to ask. But when my plans began to go awry and I realized that I probably should ask Him, I didn’t…because I was afraid. What if I didn’t like the answer? What if God wanted me to do something that I didn’t want to do? I had my agenda—my master plan. In fact, the first 25 years of my life would be defined by me and my plans. Funny thing about plans though: Proverbs 16:9 says “In his heart a man plans his course, but the Lord determines his steps.” As I made plans that didn’t quite line up with God’s, I began to run into some serious resistance. James 4:6 says “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”  \n  \n  \n  \nPride is thinking that our way is better than God’s way. As it turns out, my way was not better. Eventually, through a series of events, dream after dream and pursuit after pursuit came crashing down around me. The more my plans would fail, the angrier I would get at God. Why wouldn’t He just leave me alone and let me live my life the way I wanted?! Psalm 37:4 says to “Delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.” I was doing everything backwards! I was focused on my desires all the while wondering why I felt so distant from the Lord. Finally, after nearly a decade-long struggle against God and His will for my life, I reached the end of myself.  \n  \n  \n  \n**His Will[![Abandoned piano](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/430322_10150992457702452_87767201_n-319x150.jpg \"Abandoned piano\")](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/430322_10150992457702452_87767201_n.jpg)**  \n  \nI had been running with some people that were far from God, and my life was beginning to look more and more like theirs. I had been de-churched for a number of years when a friend invited me to check out her church. The sermon was on community, and it wasn’t long before I realized that I was the person in [Proverbs 18:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2018:1&version=NIV): a man who isolates himself seeking his own desires, and rages against all sound wisdom. I had spent my life seeking self, ignoring the truth in the Scripture. It was no wonder that I found myself full of the same hopelessness and despair that defined the lives of my non-believing friends. The prospect of being [transparent and vulnerable](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community-unmasking-the-dark-side/) was absolutely terrifying, but I knew that I needed the true and authentic community that was being preached about.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn a moment of utter despair I cried out to God, submitted my life to His will and walked away from my years of struggling to make a career in the music industry. Ephesians 2:10 says that “we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.” I knew that He created me with the gifts and talents that he did, but as long as I was trying to fulfill the desires of my own heart rather than submitting my life and will to the Lord, nothing I pursued would fulfill me. After walking away from my old life, I got [plugged into community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/plugging-in-six-ways-to-get-connected-in-community/), began to serve faithfully and selflessly and the blessings that have come from that obedience are more amazing than I could have ever dreamed of.  \n  \n  \n  \n_The he said to them all: “If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.

You have to have a strong enough distaste for the sin that you will do what is required to overcome the addiction. It’s important enough that I wanted to better explain how to do that.  \n  \n  \n  \nThough the details are specific to pornography, the general outline could apply to any sin that you need to overcome.  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Hate what it is doing to you.**  \n  \nWhat effects does pornography have on you, the user? Among [other things](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-i-date-someone-who-is-addicted-to-porn/):  \n\n  \n- **You become addicted to having a variety of sexual “partners.”** This is not an addiction that works out very well in marriage—if you ever even get to that point. The sad fact is, some single people reading this would not still be single if not for porn. And most divorces (56%) involve one spouse having “excessive” porn use. Porn is killing your marriage before you even have a spouse.\n  \n- **You lose confidence.** Pornography use is a coping mechanism for some underlying pain or insecurity. Besides not dealing with those issues, pornography gives you more things to be insecure about, and can often evolve into self-loathing and depression.\n  \n- **You become desensitized.** To everything: [good things do not bring you as much joy](http://theporch.wpengine.com/getting-away-with-it/); terrible things do not seem as bad. Beautiful people around you cease to be beautiful, because you are used to unnatural bodies on a screen.\n  \n- **You become a monster.** Eventually. As you become desensitized to porn itself, you need more extreme examples of it to get the same “fix.” So what’s more extreme? Incest. Bestiality. Rape. 90% of all porn scenes contain acts of physical or verbal aggression, and experiments have shown that porn use leads to a less positive view of women and a less negative view of rape.\n  \n  \n**2. Hate the way it hurts others.**  \n  \nPornography use hurts those you care about most, including yourself and your future or current spouse. But it hurts those in the industry even worse.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe great lie of pornographic movies is that the actors involved are really enjoying it. They are _actors_, acting out scenes in a _fictional movie_. But this type of movie has no stunt doubles, and the script includes humiliating, painful, and even abusive acts done in front of a film crew and replayed to a mass audience.  \n  \n  \n  \nHere’s what is real:  \n\n  \n- Pornographic film actors/actresses are 10 times more likely to contract STDs.\n  \n- Thanks to disease, drug use, suicide, and murder, it is reported that the average life expectancy of a pornographic performer is only 37.4 years.\n  \n- Pornography contributes to [sex trafficking](http://theporch.wpengine.com/sex-trafficking-the-problem-and-the-solution/). Fact.\n  \n  \nBy watching it, you help create the demand that keeps the industry going.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Hate the missed opportunities.**  \n  \nHow much time have you wasted on pornography over your lifetime? Hundreds of hours? Thousands? How much time? Time that you could have spent doing something great, or something you truly love.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow many years have you been enslaved by it? 5? 10? 15 years?  \n  \n  \n  \nStatistically, 13% of young adult men watch at least 5 hours a week, with 2% watching more than 20 hours a week—you do the math.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Hate what it did to Jesus.**  \n  \nBecause God forgives so freely, we have a tendency to think most sins aren’t that big of a deal.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut they are. All sin leads to death. God is holy and perfect, and therefore cannot have anything to do with sin. But He is also perfectly good and loving towards sinners. The only solution is that He take on the punishment. An infinite, immortal, completely blameless Jesus, who I imagine has an infinite ability to _feel_, took on the most painful form of capital punishment ever devised by man.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo yes, there is forgiveness. God loves you, and He’s proved it. _But the cost_.  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. Hate what it does to your relationship with Jesus.**   \n  \nYou cannot be intimate with Jesus at the same time you are doing something that caused Him to suffer and die. Your own mind won’t allow it.  \n  \n  \n  \nEven [Jesus felt separated from God](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+27:46&version=NIV) when He took on our sins on the cross.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you can look at pornography and find that because of it your relationship with God is improved—that you feel closer to God, and everything is right between you and the Creator of all good things—then go ahead and do it. But if you can’t, don’t.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’ve shepherded addicts long enough to know that an article like this makes them angry and discouraged? Remember to hate the sin, not the sinner. That applies even if the sinner is you. Hate the sin, and understand that God hates the sin, but He still loves you. Ask for forgiveness, and forgive yourself. And then ask for help.  \n  \n  \n  \n_I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do...What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! – Romans 7:15 & 24-25_   \n  \n  \n  \n(The stats sited above are from compilations of studies found on the [Covenant Eyes](http://www.covenanteyes.com/pornstats/) and [Shelley Lubben](https://www.shelleylubben.com/porn-industry-stats) websites.

According to one survey, 50% of Christian men and 20% of Christian women say they are addicted to pornography. _Addicted_, not just “I’ve seen it.” And those are just the ones who admit it. Another survey of young adults found that 68% of men and 18% of women use porn at least once a week, while 85% of men and 48% of women look at porn at least once a month.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut those are just statistics. If you are reading this, odds are it is a problem for _you_, personally. And it has been a problem for _me_, personally. In fact, I have yet to talk with anyone who struggles with this more than I did. I share that with you for two reasons: 1) because it’s true and 2) to give you hope, since The Lord has given me continued victory in this area despite regular temptation.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, I wanted to share with you how to overcome an addiction to pornography.  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Be Honest**  \n  \nThat’s right: the first step is always to admit you have a problem. But let’s define the problem.  \n  \n  \n  \nPornography is a drug addiction, which makes it just as powerful as alcoholism or smoking or any other drug. The only difference is that the “drugs” are natural chemicals produced by your body. But they have the same impact of rewiring your brain, which is why you eventually get to the point where you can’t just quit because you want to.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is also a sin, filed in the Bible under “lust.” Just because you avoid XXX sites, and instead get your fix from Facebook photos or “50 Shades of Grey” does not mean that you are avoiding pornography.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo be honest about the problem, and be specific about it.\n\n  \n- What are you using as pornography? TV? Magazines? Social media?\n  \n- How do you access it? List all ways.\n  \n- How frequently do you use it?\n  \n- When is it a problem? What times, places, activities, or events cause you to stumble?\n  \n- What lies does the enemy tell you in times of trouble? That it’s not a sin? That this will be the last time? That it’s OK to start if you don’t “finish”?\n  \n  \nYou need to write down your answers to these questions (we’ll use them in a minute) and share them with your community, so they know how to help you.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Hate Porn**  \n  \nYou have to hate it. Hate it enough to want to kill it. [Hate it enough to be willing to do whatever it takes to overcome it](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-hate-pornography/). _Whatever it takes._  \n  \n  \n  \n“But, JP, I do hate porn—except when I don’t. That’s the problem.”  \n  \n  \n  \nHey, I’ve been there. But that’s why you need to hate it enough during times of strength that you are willing to put up barriers that prevent you from accessing it in times of weakness.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Remove Access**  \n  \nYou have already listed all the ways in which you access porn. Now you have to remove that access so it is not available when you feel tempted. What does it mean to remove access?  \n\n  \n- Take a different route to work if you need to.\n  \n- If you struggle at the convenience store, do not go in the store.\n  \n- If the TV causes you to stumble, get rid of it.\n  \n- If the internet causes you to stumble, REMOVE ACCESS.  \n\n  \n  - Consider every computer or mobile device you have access to.\n  \n  - Install accountability /filtering software (this is an absolute must).\n  \n  - If you ever get around a net “guard,” even once, it is useless; you need a new boundary. (But do not use that as an excuse not to have one.)\n  \n  - If this means you never get on the web again…go back to #2 above. If your job requires you to have unfiltered access to porn, quit your job.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n“But, JP, I can’t do that. I can’t quit my job/iPhone/Facebook friends!” Yes, you can. It can be done. What you are saying is that you aren’t willing to do it. See #2. Am I being too extreme here? Legalistic? Read carefully the words of Jesus in [Matthew 5:27-29](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A27-29&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nOnce a boundary is set, do not compromise. If you do compromise, confess it immediately to your community, and ask for prayer.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Pray Daily**  \n  \nIf or when it seems impossible, turn to the One Who can do the “impossible” with ease.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod knows your struggle. You will not tell Him something He does not already know. Let Him in on all areas of your life. Ask for His help in overcoming this every morning. Here is the prayer of a struggling addict:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Heavenly Father, today please help me to only think thoughts that honor You. I will come into contact with many people of the opposite sex today. I do not want to picture them naked or mentally have sex with them. Please help me to be victorious in this. Father, please make me aware of where temptation lies and give me courage to [flee from it](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:18&version=NIV). Convict me of any areas of my life that do not bring glory to You. Please always give me an alternative to sin, [a way out](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2010:13&version=NIV). Make me the person you desire me to be._   \n  \n  \n  \nYou cannot have a right relationship with Christ and be actively looking at porn. I’m not saying you aren’t saved, necessarily; just that it hurts your intimacy with God. And intimacy with God kills your relationship with porn.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Resources**  \n  \nI would encourage you to keep it simple. Simple does not equal easy; something can be simple and hard. It’s just better than being complicated and hard.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut if you are serious about getting help and want more details, below are some resources that can be useful.  \n\n  \n- If you are in Dallas, you can [get help with any addiction through re:generation](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery/) on Monday nights.\n  \n- You need to be in community with other believers you can trust.

From a worldly perspective, things seemed to be going great: I was blessed with an extremely close family, lots of friends, a successful college education, and financial stability. All of these worldly things and experiences seemed to be enough to make me happy, but that wasn’t the case.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Identity Crisis**  \n  \nI found myself completely consumed in a very unhealthy relationship with someone I thought for sure would eventually be my husband. For five years, I found my identity through my relationship with him, rather than my relationship with Christ. I saw my future with him: the house, the kids, the whole “white picket fence” dream.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen things began to crumble, my security and my happiness began to disintegrate as well. I didn’t want to _feel_ the pain or heartache from the breakup I saw coming, so I decided not to feel anything at all. I began taking anxiety pills, depression pills, and sleeping pills to numb everything.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs my life visibly spiraled, my family and friends were very concerned because I wasn’t the “Happy Kim” that they had always been used to. Instead, I just shut everyone out. It wasn’t until I finally felt as if I had hit my personal rock bottom that I reached out for help from my parents and sisters.  \n  \n  \n  \n**From Happy to Joyful**  \n  \nMy sisters had always encouraged me to go to Watermark and get plugged in to the body of believers there, but I always seemed to find excuses. Now that I was single, not traveling every weekend to see my boyfriend, and lost with no direction, I figured there was nothing left to lose. I longed for something to fill the hole that I felt in my heart and for the loneliness that I was experiencing to disappear. I believed the story that Christ died for my sins, but I never had an intimate relationship with Him, and never quite understood the meaning of His love.  \n  \n  \n  \nFinally stepping out of my comfort zone, I went through [GroupLink](http://www.watermark.org/news-events/registration/july-singles-grouplink/250981092/) and joined a community group with six complete strangers who, three years later, I've come to know as amazing sisters in Christ! That is where my transformation began. I also started attending services at Watermark, serving in childcare on Sundays, and attending The Porch. But God wasn’t done with me yet.  \n  \n  \n  \nI still felt as if something wasn’t complete inside of me. In reality I was only checking the boxes of what I thought was expected of me. My actions outside of church still seemed to align more with the world instead of the Word. Taking another jump out of my comfort zone, I decided to start serving at The Porch, and _wow_, did Jesus take over! I had no idea that there were so many young, faithful Christian adults out there that were going through the same daily struggles that I had. I felt my life changing drastically, and for once I was finding my identity not through others, but through my Savior. I finally felt that hole in my heart closing, being filled with the love of Christ. That intimate relationship with Him that was once lacking is now present and has made me not just “Happy Kim” but _“Joyful Kim.”_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Who I Am Meant to Be**  \n  \nI experienced first-hand how God loves each and every one of us, regardless of our past. We have been made new through the blood of Jesus Christ!  \n  \n  \n  \n_Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! – 2 Corinthians 5:17_   \n  \n  \n  \nI have discovered who I am meant to be in Christ. I am joyful and confident through the love of Jesus Christ. I surround myself daily with brothers and sisters in Christ who spur me on and encourage me through Scripture. I know that I will have trials and tribulation, but one thing that JP said at The Porch resonates in my mind: “God will give you more than you can handle, but he won’t give you more than you can handle _through_ him.”  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen those trials and tribulations come, I am ready to overcome them by walking with the Lord.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight. – Proverbs 3:5-6_  \n  \n  \n  \nAMEN!  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

It’s hard to even watch, and, needless to say, it is no confidence booster to be in those shoes.  \n  \n  \n  \nAfter thinking about that scene more and more, I am convinced that we all feel like an LP (last pick – our acronym for today) at some point in our lives.  \n  \n  \n  \nMaybe we are not physically left standing alone with the “in-crowd” staring back at us. In fact, maybe it is such a deep feeling of isolation and loneliness that others are not even aware we are going through it. We are ashamed. We are fearful that others will think differently of us if they find out. Maybe they will actually live up to that “popular crowd” stereotype and point their fingers and laugh. We feel alone in our loneliness, pushing our “me” island farther away from the mainland.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Drifting Away**  \n  \nCan I tell you something?  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is EXACTLY what Satan wants.  \n  \n  \n  \nAny form of prohibiting progress in our lives is like a check on Satan’s to-do list. “Cleere drifted further? Perfect! Don’t let her know people care or that people are searching for her on the mainland.”  \n  \n  \n  \nYou see, isolation is a tricky feeling. It makes you feel alone and feel the need to seclude yourself out of a fear of not relating to others. However, when we are feeling alone, isolated, uncertain, or self-conscious, THAT is when community is absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, necessary.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Benefits of Community**  \n  \nBiblical community allows us to do several things:  \n\n  \n1. It helps us see our situation, circumstances, and overall life from a different perspective.\n  \n2. It aids us in pushing ourselves to get out of our “me-conscious” phase and focus more on being “God-conscious,” with the help of accountability and reminders of His promises for our lives.\n  \n3. It helps us push our boats towards the mainland, where we will [realize that we were never actually alone](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community-not-the-only-one/). We have friends and family who desire to HELP us, not judge us.\n  \n4. It allows [light to begin to permeate through our darkness](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community-unmasking-the-dark-side/). We can then see that even in the deep oceans we were traveling through, Jesus was there. He never leaves us nor forsakes us; therefore we are never alone.\n  \n5. It allows love to chip away at our fear, so we can face the situations or circumstances that before left us feeling isolated. Our actions are bold because we know that through Jesus, we are victorious.\n  \n  \n**Drop Your Anchor**  \n  \nThe best part is, when we are IN community and we start rowing our boat out to our “isolation island,” our community jumps in the boat and keeps us anchored to the mainland.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe purpose of community is never judgment or condemnation, but rather a deep promise to follow Jesus together, hand-in-hand. I know in my own personal life, when I jump in my boat and start feeling self-conscious, unworthy, and insecure, my community reminds me that I am loved, sacred, and absolutely treasured by the King of Kings. We feast on God’s Word together, and I am reminded that my feelings of insecurity should never be accepted as truth when my heavenly Father has already written a whole love story to me proclaiming otherwise.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy friends, my community—it is through them that Jesus shows me I am worthy of being invested in and loved.  \n  \n  \n  \nI highly encourage you to get involved in community of some type.

As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another._ – _John 13:34-35_  \n  \n  \n  \n_Love must be sincere.

I experienced physical, verbal, and emotional abuse growing up. I didn’t receive the brunt of the abuse, but I experienced and witnessed it enough times that I lived in fear. Those incidents had a lasting effect. I reached out to a trusted adult at one point, but she just sent me back home and never looked into my allegations. This made me feel like confiding in anyone about my home life was futile, so I kept my mouth shut and lived in emotional isolation, which soon turned into depression.  \n\n#### **Leaving a Void**\n  \nBy the time my freshman year of college was over, my parents were separated and on the way to divorcing. I moved back in with my mom, but another hardship reared its ugly head. Cancer. My mom was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer that had spread to her liver and lungs, and I became her caretaker.  \n  \nA few tumultuous years later, she passed away, and I lost my mom and best friend in a single day. This tragedy caused the depression and anxiety that I’d already been struggling with for years to intensify to the point where I contemplated suicide on numerous occasions. In retrospect, I know that God was the only reason I never went through with my plans, but I would have been so much better off if I had actively sought Him out. In the years that followed, I tried to fill the void left by my mom’s death and my lack of a loving father with work, hobbies, and unhealthy relationships.  \n\n#### **Peace with God**\n  \nYears later, I got a seasonal job at Macy’s to earn a little extra cash, but God had something better in mind. One night, a mother and daughter came in to buy dresses to wear to a family wedding. As I rang them up, the daughter gave me a tiny booklet entitled “Peace with God.” After they left, I opened the booklet and saw [Proverbs 3:5-6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3%3A5-6&version=NIV) on the first page, and I instantly knew that God was trying to get my attention. You see, [Proverbs 3:6](http://bib.ly/Pr3.6.ESV) was on a plaque that had belonged to my grandmother, and it was also my mom’s favorite verse. My life wasn’t how I envisioned because I was leaning on my own understanding and not letting God direct me.  \n  \nA few months later, I was led to The Porch. The messages were full of biblical truth and they were delivered in a way that I found relevant and relatable. More importantly, my heart had been primed and opened to God, so the messages could actually affect me. It wasn’t long before I found a community group of great women and started [re:generation](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery/) so I could work on healing the wounds from my past, form healthy God-honoring friendships, and learn how to really walk with Christ. Understanding the goodness, wisdom, and love of God as evidenced by the sacrifice of His only Son has helped me place my trust in God instead of the broken world that we live in. My new faith also helped me forgive my abuser and others who had hurt me. I realized that I didn’t want them to pay for their sins eternally anymore than I wanted to pay for mine, so I began praying for their salvation.  \n\n#### **The New Me**\n  \nAs I’ve spent time in the Word day after day and asked Christ to lead me and shape me, I have experienced true freedom from depression for the first time in fifteen years. My circumstances have not changed drastically, but my heart definitely has. While I know that I’m still guaranteed trouble in this life ([John 16:33](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A33&version=NIV)), I now have more peace than I ever thought possible because I don’t allow myself to be defined by that trouble. Christ has made me new ([2 Corinthians 5:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A17&version=NIV)), and I can’t wait to see what God does with the new me.  \n  \n"},"url":{"en-US":"freedom-from-depression"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/freedom-from-depression/"}}},

Which we are happy to do, because we'd love to help resource and equip young adult ministries everywhere.  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, the question implies that we are the smart ones (we’re not) and that we have “the answer” that others do not have. Frankly, “the answer” is Jesus, and for some reason He has chosen to work through the ministry to [change lives](http://theporch.wpengine.com/category/our-stories/) week after week. And though I thank Him for it, I don’t know why He has chosen to work here.  \n  \n  \n  \nI realize that “I don’t know” is not a very satisfying answer. So, in case it might be helpful, I thought we could share some details about the history of The Porch, and what our part has been in this adventure so far.  \n  \n  \n  \n(Disclaimer: I was not involved with The Porch in the beginning of the ministry. I think I was in a bar on Lower Greenville at the time, to be honest. So some of these details come from those who were already faithfully serving at that time.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**It started as an experiment.**  \n  \nLiterally so, considering the very first meeting of what would become The Porch was a one-time event held off-campus to test and pray for the idea. That was 8 years ago this summer. The Porch was then officially launched as a weekly ministry that fall, on September 13, 2005.  \n  \n  \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment\\_4862\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"330\"][![2005 Porch Shirt Back](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/porch2005shirtbacksmall.jpg \"2005 Porch Shirt Back\")](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/porch2005shirtback.jpg) Ye Olde Porch Shirt.[/caption]  \n  \nT-shirts announcing the “Launch” of The Porch were handed out at the annual [Labor Day Weekend Retreat](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-is-the-launch-retreat/), which helped lead to a new, shorter name for that event. The T-shirts also featured an illustration of a poorly-built rocket with the caption “Let’s face reality my friends…we’re not exactly rocket scientists.” So, from the start, it was acknowledged that nobody knew whether this would work and that we were basically making it up as we went along.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat continues to this day, as we are regularly trying new things. Some succeed, some fail, and some actually fail at first and then come back and succeed.  \n  \n  \n  \n**It didn’t come from nothing.**  \n  \nWatermark did have an active young adults ministry before The Porch. It had community groups, the aforementioned annual retreat, and occasional social events. It just didn’t have a consistent worship service where everybody came together in one place.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe fact that there was _something_ is important, though, because it means there were people praying for it and invested in it from the beginning. Volunteers were already in place before the first “official” Porch, which is important, because:  \n  \n  \n  \n**It is run by volunteers.**  \n  \nIn fact, as it has grown, The Porch has become more and more volunteer-driven.  \n  \n  \n  \nA big turning point occurred about 4 years ago, when we took our volunteers and split them into different teams focused on different parts of the ministry. Instead of just showing up and being available, they each had an area to own and become excellent at.  \n  \n  \n  \nInstead of greeters, we had evangelists. Instead of ushers, we had biblical counselors. The bar was raised for everyone. We put faithful volunteers as leaders over the teams, and then just let them do what God had called them to do—lead.  \n  \n  \n  \nNow we have well over 100 lay pastors at The Porch, who must go through a 2-month training program before they can start to serve as volunteers. They are the ones God is using to make a difference in the lives of young adults in Dallas.  \n  \n  \n  \n**We don’t shy away from Truth.**  \n  \n“Authentic” is a key word around here. We don’t water things down or try to pretend. We deal with reality, and in reality we are sinful people living in a fallen world. It gets uncomfortable sometimes, and can drive off people who are not yet willing to change.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is worth noting that a few of the [sermon podcasts](http://theporch.wpengine.com/media/) come with an “explicit content” warning, and that some of the pages on this very blog are flagged as “mature” by Covenant Eyes. But we are all adults here, and can handle the truth. What’s important is that we keep our eyes focused on The Truth.  \n  \n  \n  \n**We are on a mission.**  \n  \nThough much has changed, at the core The Porch has stayed the same. That’s because we don’t have a “worship service”; we have a mission.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is embedded into the very name. “The Porch” is an entryway for the people of the city into our home, where we live as a family. It is also a place for us to see the world outside, and go out into that world the rest of the week and minister to our neighbors.  \n  \n  \n  \nI pray that this is still just the beginning of our mission. Will you join us?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"porch-history-lessons"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/porch-history-lessons/"}}},

Though our dad was still very involved in our lives, my younger sister and I lived with our mom. She wanted us to grow up in the church, because she thought that was the right thing to do. We attended a Christian school and were at church twice a week, but we were just going through the motions. I didn’t really grasp the concept of a relationship with my heavenly Father.  \n  \n  \n  \nBecause of God’s love for me, He pursued me and placed people in my life to point me to Him. On a youth trip when I was 13, I accepted Jesus as my Savior. For the first time, I repented of my sins and wanted to live a life that honored Christ. I made a public profession of my faith and was baptized. I spent the next few years being mentored by my youth leaders and learning the spiritual disciplines.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Two Worlds**  \nIn high school, our family moved out of our Christian bubble and into the suburbs, which meant going to a public school for the first time. Changing schools and churches shook my world. I didn’t know anyone and felt very alone.  \n  \n  \n  \nInstead of relying on God, I took control. I pushed God to the side and started trying to earn the approval of my peers. Using humor and sports to be popular, I became consumed with what others thought of me. I drank, lied to my parents, and constantly tore others down. I thought I would be OK as long as I didn’t do the “big” things, stayed just above the world’s standards, and continued to go to church on Sundays. I wanted to have the best of both worlds.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy mom would always tell me that God was not going to give up on pursuing me, and that He would use a circumstance to get my attention if necessary. But I just let her words go in one ear and out the other.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Balancing Act**  \nAfter high school, I went away to college with my best friend. We were finally free—no curfew or parents telling us what to do! Still walking the fence, I spent my freshman year partying it up on fraternity row and in Bible study with Campus Crusade. I thought I was doing a good job at balancing being a Christian and being accepted by the world.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe summer after my freshman year was a defining moment in my walk with Christ and it’s when I lost all control. My mom went on vacation that summer and never came back. She was murdered in a third-world country. I was in total shock and completely devastated. It was like a dream world. My life forever changed that day. I immediately blamed myself for her death. I thought if I had been a better Christian, God wouldn’t have taken her from me.  \n  \n  \n  \nI carried that burden back to school my sophomore year. The Campus Crusade staff surrounded me and pointed me back to God’s truth. God showed up in a big way. The love and support of my Campus Crusade community helped me surrender it all to God and find joy in the midst of the storm. It was that year that I learned what it looked like to have a real relationship with Jesus and what it meant to abide in Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Higher Authority**  \nAfter college, God opened a door for a job in Washington, D.C.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen I moved there, I did not have a community to speak into my life and hold me accountable to God’s truth. So, I soon got caught up in my career and in the world. I had an all-consuming and high-powered job, and it defined me. In D.C., it’s all about who you know and who you work for, and that became my identity. It distracted me from focusing on God.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut God is faithful. He kept pursing me despite myself. After moving to Dallas and getting plugged in at Watermark, I realized how much I was focusing on and relying on myself. Watermark and The Porch have taught me that I can’t do it on my own. I need constant community, and need people to push me towards Christ and hold me accountable. [Left to myself, I will isolate](http://theporch.wpengine.com/no-more-isolation-island/) and let the distractions of life steal God’s glory. God is continuing to work on my heart, and is showing me that He is all I need.  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

He was a missionary who spread the gospel to the Gentile world, which would include me and (probably) you and everyone who is not Jewish. He also wrote almost half of the books in the New Testament, including [Galatians](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/315/), [Ephesians](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/257/), [Philippians](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/213/), and [Titus](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/286/).  \n  \n  \n  \nHis life mattered.  \n  \n  \n  \nPaul was very effective at his life’s work, and for good reason. He was ideally suited for and skilled at what he did. For example:\n\n  \n- **He was both a Roman and a Jew.** Paul was born in Tarsus, a Roman city and capital of the province. He and his family were Jewish, though. That’s the real reason why [he had two names](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:9&version=NIV): Saul was a traditional Hebrew name (think King Saul), while Paul was his Roman name used when he started his missionary work in Gentile areas. The fact that he was both allowed him to fit in anywhere ([1 Corinthians 9:20-22](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:20-22&version=NIV)), like a first-century spy.\n  \n- **He spoke the language.** Literally. He spoke Greek, the common language of the Gentile areas he ministered in, because Tarsus was a Greek-speaking city. He also spoke Aramaic and/or Hebrew, the language of the Jews. See [Acts 21:32-22:2](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2021:37-22:2&version=NIV) for the importance of his bilingual skills.\n  \n- **He was crazy smart.** Tarsus was a university city, known for scholarly pursuits. Think Cambridge. This is probably a big source of the philosophy and debating skills he later showed in his letters and in places like Athens (see [Acts 17:16-21](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:16-21&version=NIV)).\n  \n- **He was a Pharisee.** This is why he was also crazy smart when it came to understanding the Old Testament and explaining how Jesus fulfilled the Scriptures. He was “thoroughly trained in the law” by Gamaliel ([Acts 22:3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2022:3&version=NIV)), which is sort of like saying you learned physics from Stephen Hawking. Pharisees were also strict legalists, which is why Paul was so impacted by Jesus’ grace and got so worked up when speaking _against_ legalism in Galatians.\n  \n- **He was a Roman citizen.** And a Roman citizen by birth, because he was born in Tarsus. This was a rare and valuable thing at the time, giving him special rights and privileges and saving his neck at least once (see [Acts 22:24-29](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2022:24-29&version=NIV)).\n  \n- **He was single.** Though many single Christians today see that as a curse, Paul saw this as an advantage. It allowed him to travel freely and focus fully on reaching the lost ([1 Corinthians 7:32-35](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207:32-35&version=NIV)).\n  \n- **He persecuted Christians.** He threw many in jail, assisted in at least one murder ([Acts 8:1-3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%208:1-3&version=NIV)), and threatened to murder others ([Acts 9:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%209:1&version=NIV)). This ended up giving him the most powerful testimony imaginable: the person who tried to destroy the Church by stoning and imprisoning Christians ended up being willingly stoned and imprisoned himself in order to build the Church. The truth of the gospel was _that important_. \n  \n  \nNow, here’s why I think all of this matters to you or I today: every single one of the things that made Paul so effective occurred _before_ he became a Christian. They were not the result of Paul trying to be a better Christian; they were from the “wasted” part of his life, when he was a very literal [enemy of God](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:21&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is the same guy who wrote Ephesians 2:10:  \n  \n   \n  \n_For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do._  \n  \n   \n  \nPaul was successful because God prepared him in advance to do a specific work for Him. As it says in Acts 9:15-16, right at the time of his conversion:  \n  \n  \n  \n_But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.”_  \n  \n   \n  \nThat’s exactly what he ended up doing. God had it all planned out, even to the point of Paul getting arrested because that would put him in front of governors and kings and give him the legal right to present his case to Caesar.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod has a plan for each believer. He has a plan for you. If you wonder what that plan is, look at how He has prepared you: the skills, passions, and experiences (even _bad_ experiences) that you already have. God loves to redeem the past of sinners like me by using that past to reach others.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat has God prepared you to do?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP and Kevin McConaghy"},"url":{"en-US":"paul-pastor-martyr-murderer-spy"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/paul-pastor-martyr-murderer-spy/"}}},

It was as if His presence was surrounding me the entire time. I couldn’t explain it to anyone around me. They all assumed it was shock. Maybe it was, but I believe in something greater. In [Philippians 4:7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians%204:7&version=NIV), it says that God will grant peace that passes all understanding. That was my story. In the middle of one of the worst moments of my life, I had unexplainable peace that can’t come from anything less than the supernatural.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Morgan:**   \n  \nAs I was driving home from a wedding rehearsal, I received one of the worst phone calls I never wanted to receive. One of my best friends was on the other line telling me she had just been raped. I hung up shortly after and called 9-1-1. It’s a miracle I made it home safely to her.  \n  \n  \n  \nFrom the phone call on, that night was completely a blur. However, that night and in the weeks following, I felt the Lord’s presence like I had never felt it before. When we were at the hospital that night with Rachel, women from her community group and some of our friends stayed with us at the hospital the entire night. Rachel’s family lived four hours away, so our community was our family that night. People woke from sleep to come be with us. They prayed with us and reminded us so sweetly of [2 Corinthians 1:3-7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%201:3-7&version=NIV) where Paul talks about God, the father of compassion and all comfort, comforts us in our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Rachel:**  \n  \nI took some time away from Dallas after that night to heal and spend time with my family. It was truly a blessing to get away from it all, but I still had loose ends to tie up in Dallas. I couldn’t go back to my home and really had nowhere to live.  \n  \n  \n  \nUnknowingly, God was working in the lives of people in Dallas to move in inexplicable ways and tie some of those loose ends for me. One of my roommates was leaving for a [mission trip in Nicaragua](http://theporch.wpengine.com/el-agua-viva-the-living-water/) two days after it happened, so it was really up to our third roommate—quite a task for someone who had also been through so much.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is where God stepped in. Isn’t it wonderful when He takes control of things that are so uncontrollable! He brought together a group of ordinary twenty-somethings that had been in community since [Launch](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-is-the-launch-retreat/) of 2011 and bonded them together with a passion for serving Christ and loving others. This was exactly what my roommates and I needed. I knew God was powerful from the moment I was attacked, but He showed up in mightier ways than I could have ever imagined through the love of this group. They were the reason I returned to this city and have returned in small ways to the woman God created me to be.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Morgan:**  \n  \nThe day after the attack, Rachel went to be with her family and I started calling apartment after apartment trying to find a new place for the three of us to live. I was supposed to hop on a plane to Nicaragua the next day, and was asking the Lord for strength that only He could give to do so. After I left, our third roommate, Julie, and a friend went to look at apartments and signed a lease for us.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs I was coming back from Nicaragua later the next week, I was able to get online and discovered that not only had our friends found us a new apartment, but about 20 of them had packed up all of our stuff at our house, cleaned it, and moved us completely into this new apartment. To say that Rachel, Julie, and I were thankful would be a complete understatement. I have never seen the hands and feet of Christ work like I did during this time. One of our friends even took the time to color-coordinate our closets and bookshelves for us.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Morgan and Rachel:**   \n  \nCommunity is something that [the Lord calls us to as believers](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community-not-our-idea/), but we have never seen it come to life like it did these past few months. It is absolutely true that “where two or three gather in my name, there I am with them” (Matthew 18:20).  \n  \n  \n  \nIf anyone going to The Porch has not found this kind of community yet, we would encourage you to [jump into the programs](http://www.watermark.org/news-events/registration/july-singles-grouplink/250981092/) that Watermark has created for us. Finding friends through the Porch and community have allowed us the chance to see a piece of God’s glory in the midst of heartache and trials. That’s what God intended for all of us. Do it; you’ll be glad you did!  \n  \n  \n  \n_Photo at top courtesy of Creative Commons: [http://morallowground.com/wp-content/uploads/police-line-tony-webster.jpg](http://morallowground.com/wp-content/uploads/police-line-tony-webster.jpg)/_"},"url":{"en-US":"community-hands-and-feet-in-the-worst-of-times"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/community-hands-and-feet-in-the-worst-of-times/"}}},

You might think that means we are all perfect for each other, or started off as best friends. But that’s not the case.  \n  \n  \n  \nI had never even met any of the guys currently in our community group before our first group meeting. After that first meeting, I quickly realized that we had nothing in common, and I honestly didn't want to go back. They were all engineers, and I had an art degree. I saw them as geeks, and they saw me as a pretentious Dallas metrosexual. I was wrong about them, but they were right about me—that is, until God began to use them to work incredible changes in my life. Today, we actually are best friends, are all married, and our wives are a part of the group, too.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut we did (and still do) have to work at it. And though each group of people is different, some of the best practices we learned would apply to every community group.  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Align expectations.**   \n  \nNothing will frustrate you more than being on different pages. What do you hope to get out of the group? Would everyone else in the group answer that question the same way? Don't just assume so.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou cannot offer someone “accountability” if they don’t want it. You will be wasting your time, and they will hate you for it. Ask them: Are they willing to confess sin? Will they share the happenings of their lives openly? Are they committed to the goals of the group?  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Determine your track.**  \n  \nOnce you have buy-in from everyone, determine the “track” you will run on. Will you study a book of the Bible together, or simply hold each other accountable to individual Bible-reading? Will you go through a curriculum together (for example: [MoneyWise](http://www.watermark.org/am-site/media/moneywise-curriculum.pdf)), or keep the time open to discuss accountability and life?  \n  \n  \n  \nThis will also help determine how often you should meet, how long each meeting will run, and what the “agenda” will be for each meeting.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Commit.**   \n  \nEach person has to decide to commit to the group. If you are not committed, it is too easy to choose in the moment not to go to a group meeting. The big game is on, you had to work late, or you are super tired. These all might seem to be valid excuses unless you have previously decided what it is acceptable to miss group for.  \n  \n  \n  \nMiss group only for what you would miss work for. You probably wouldn't miss work because the big game is on, but you might miss it if you have a 104-degree fever. Make the group a priority.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Appoint a leader.**   \n  \nThe leader's primary job is communication. They remind everyone where you are meeting, when, and what they need to be prepared for. They are also responsible for keeping the meetings on track, and serve as the point person for communicating with the church.  \n  \n  \n  \nLeadership can regularly rotate between group members, if you want. However, if someone is good at it and willing to handle that responsibility, they will bless your group.  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. Check the pulse.**   \n  \nConsistently take time to ask others how they feel the group is going. You may find ways to improve, or determine that you need to change gears.  \n  \n  \n  \nThere will be seasons of discouragement, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you are doing it wrong. This stuff is hard work.  \n  \n  \n  \nCommunity has changed my life for the better. If you want to experience that change, you can get into a community group at [GroupLink](http://www.watermark.org/news-events/registration/july-singles-grouplink/250981092/) coming up on July 14, or through the Open Community Groups after The Porch each Tuesday.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou may not be best friends, or have even met the people who will be in your group. But you can focus on what you do have in common as brothers or sisters in Christ.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor those who are in community, what best practices have you found helpful? I’d love to hear them in the comments below.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"community-best-practices"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/community-best-practices/"}}},

My parents instilled in me a great sense of morality from a very young age, which was enhanced by my time spent in the Catholic church. I have known the Ten Commandments ever since I can remember and I always tried my hardest to follow them. I stood out as the nice kid, the one who was well-behaved and always seemed to do the right thing. From the earliest time I can remember, I believed in God, but I spent much of my early life trying really hard. I started growing weary—how good was good enough?  \n  \n  \n  \nI could never seem to do enough good. My grades were not quite perfect, I couldn't win enough sporting events, I could not help enough people by volunteering, I could not seem to win friends’ approval, I could not seem to win my parents’ approval, and I definitely could not seem to win God's approval.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Where Grace Steps In**  \n  \nWhen I was 13 years old, someone shared Ephesians 2:8-9 with me, helping me realize there was nothing I could ever do to earn God’s grace. As it says, “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.”  \n  \n  \n  \nI then discovered Revelation 3:20, “Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me,” and I realized that Jesus was inviting me to have a relationship with Him. That realization caused a huge weight to be lifted from my shoulders. A peace that surpasses all understanding came over my life.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What Does a Relationship with Christ Look Like?**  \n  \nAs I started to walk in this grace I started to think that loving my friends well and giving them grace meant remaining silent when I saw them making sinful decisions. I started to let go of the high standards I had for them, and over time, I consequentially stopped holding _myself_ to the highest of standards—holiness. As small glimpses of sin started slipping into my life, my relationship with Christ began to grow distant. I would constantly turn back to Him, but I had no idea what a relationship with Him looked like and I had no one in my life to model it for me. Year after year, I was searching for significance in lots of different places—church, academics, leadership, drinking, money, work, and friends, but nothing seemed to provide the peace that I once had.  \n  \n  \n  \nThen I came to The Porch and was challenged by another verse from Revelation 3—verses 15 and 16— “I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**Fighting Lukewarmth**  \n  \nI was lukewarm in my faith and God was drawing me in. He had asked me to sit at the table with him so many times, but I was constantly ignoring His invitation. This time I decide to let Him eat with me. I had no idea what to do, so I started asking around and found three things that have made all of the difference in my relationship with God:  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. I got into a [community group](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/).\n  \n2. I started volunteering my time with the church on a consistent basis.\n  \n3. I started reading my Bible every day.\n  \n  \nAfter implementing these three principles, my heart started changing rapidly and I felt drawn to walk in an intimate relationship with God.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor many good kids, knowing the difference between morality and intimacy with Christ can be hard to differentiate, but God is never fooled. If you look at your faith and feel lukewarm, that is probably what you are, and God would spit you out of His mouth.  \n  \n  \n  \nI would love to chat with you!"},"url":{"en-US":"not-good-enough"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/not-good-enough/"}}},

Sure, we want to be an ongoing, 24/7 resource for the community of folks who gather at The Porch each Tuesday night.

Odd combination, but here I am. Growing up in the South, especially here in Dallas, one would think that every individual would know who God is or who Jesus is. I ended up as one who did not know that there was a God, and had no knowledge of who this person of Jesus Christ was.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy parents taught me that I was to be a good kid, get an education, and get a good job. I built my whole life on those principles. But without God, and as an only child whose parents were always working, I had no affirmation or wisdom as to how I was living or working. This led to some really poor decisions, and caused me to begin looking for affirmation in sports, band, and girls.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy senior year of high school, I placed my hope in having a dating relationship with a particular young lady. I was very disappointed when that failed to work out, and confided in a mutual friend to try to find out what went wrong. All she told me was that I should believe in Jesus, and then she walked away from me. Completely dumbfounded by her answer, I began to wrestle with the idea that God might be real. Through a series of situations and conversations, God started drawing me towards the Bible. I found a Bible, started reading, and from day one had an insatiable thirst for the Scriptures. God started to reveal Himself to me through His Word.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt was through the Gospel of John that I learned about the person of Jesus. Jesus answers Thomas in John 14:6-7, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.\" I then learned about the beginning of sin in [Genesis 3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%203&version=NIV), which is why the world is fallen and broken, and how in 2 Cor. 5:21, \"God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\" In [Ephesians 2](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%202&version=NIV), I learned that we were dead in our trespasses and sins. But God, because of His great love for us, made us alive in Christ. He gave me the grace and faith to repent and confess Jesus as Lord and believe in my heart that God raised Him from the dead.  \n  \n  \n  \nToday I stand with David in Psalm 143:10, \"Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; may your good Spirit lead me on level ground.\" I am a recent college graduate and have moved back home to Dallas. I am going to battle against sin, waging war with the flesh in [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/), and am absolutely ecstatic to [serve](http://theporch.wpengine.com/about-us/serve) Watermark with the gifts God has given me for His glory. Arm in arm with God, I am working to build up the church here at Watermark, to seek the welfare of Dallas, and to make Him famous.  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

Even if you have never been to church, you have almost certainly heard it at some point.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut what makes it so popular and so powerful?  \n  \n  \n  \nI would say it is not the music itself, considering that “Amazing Grace” has been sung to multiple different tunes, all of them borrowed from other songs which have themselves largely been forgotten.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe power of “Amazing Grace” is that its lyrics are all about [God’s amazing grace](http://www.watermark.org/media/power-of-grace/2661/). There is simply nothing more important or powerful than that. The lyrics do a really good job of conveying that message, especially if you look at the story and Scripture behind them.  \n  \n  \n  \n_**Amazing grace! How sweet the sound,  \nThat saved a wretch like me!**_    \n  \n  \n  \nWhy is grace so amazing? “Grace” means “undeserved kindness.” God gives us something good that we don’t deserve. It is “amazing” both because of how good the gift is, and how much we utterly fail to deserve it.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe gift is eternal life in paradise. There is no way you could ever be given anything better than that. And it is amazing [what it cost God to give that gift](http://theporch.wpengine.com/someone-has-to-pay/).  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd yet the gift is given to a “wretch.” That could describe any of us, but the person who wrote the lyrics is an interesting example. “Amazing Grace” was written by John Newton in 1779. Some facts about Newton’s earlier life:\n\n  \n- He was a sailor in the British Navy, but went AWOL and was punished for deserting.\n  \n- He contemplated a murder-suicide of his ship captain, but didn’t go through with it.\n  \n- He was so fond of profanity that it _made sailors uncomfortable_. He even made up new cuss words because the existing ones weren’t enough for him.\n  \n- He was such a bad shipmate that one crew chained him, starved him, and sold him into slavery in Africa.\n  \n- After being freed from slavery, he became captain of a slave ship himself.\n  \n  \nIn other words, he was not exaggerating when he called himself a “wretch.” And yet God gave him grace. No wonder that was music to his ears.  \n  \n  \n  \n_**I once was lost but now am found,  \nWas blind, but now I see.**_    \n  \n  \n  \nAfter experiencing God’s amazing grace, Newton became a minister. His Bible study shows through his lyrics. In [Luke 15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+15&version=NIV), when religious leaders complained about Jesus welcoming sinners, Jesus told three stories about how He seeks those who are “lost.” The third story, about the prodigal son, uses the words “he was lost and is found” ([Luke 15:32](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2015:32&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \n“Was blind, but now I see” is a direct quote from [John 9:25](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%209:25&version=NIV), and is the testimony of a man who met Jesus. It would also apply to Newton: though he was once a slave ship captain, he later saw how evil that was. By speaking out and describing the horrific details of life on a slave ship, he helped inspire his friend [William Wilberforce to fight for the abolition of the slave trade](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-power-of-being-faithful/).  \n  \n  \n  \n_**T'was grace that taught my heart to fear.  \nAnd grace, my fears relieved;  \nHow precious did that grace appear  \nThe hour I first believed!**_    \n  \n  \n  \nHere the song gets a bit deeper theologically. “T’was grace that taught my heart to fear” means that without God’s grace, we wouldn’t even know that we needed saving. Our natural tendency is to live for ourselves and our own sinful desires, after all.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is important because it means that we truly do nothing to earn salvation; even our awareness of the problem is a gift. That is why Paul says that faith itself is a gift of God in Ephesians 2:8-9:  \n  \n  \n  \n_\"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.\"_  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is [the same Paul](http://theporch.wpengine.com/paul-pastor-martyr-murderer-spy/) who did nothing to be saved other than persecute and murder Christians, so he understood the fullness of grace.  \n  \n  \n  \nThere are multiple other verses to the song, but different musicians or hymnals will include or leave out various ones. However, there is one I’ve always liked that is usually added on as the last verse:  \n  \n  \n  \n_**When we've been there ten thousand years  \nBright shining as the sun;  \nWe've no less days to sing God's praise  \nThan when we've first begun.**_    \n  \n  \n  \nYou see, eternity is such a hard concept to grasp. This does a good job of explaining the enormity of the gift. After ten thousand, or ten million, or ten trillion years, we are no closer to the end of eternity (because there is no “end”).  \n  \n  \n  \nAmazing.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat are your favorite hymn lyrics?  \n  \n  \n  \n- [JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author) and [Kevin McConaghy](https://plus.google.com/108225385241400201197?rel=author)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"159elUinSkESuiqeQYAIUg"}}},"url":{"en-US":"amazing-grace-lyrical-theology"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/amazing-grace-lyrical-theology/"}}},

Wow! We’re thrilled to see all the people who have taken steps toward getting connected in biblical community.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs these new groups get started, it’s really important for everyone in the group to be on the same page for how the group will operate. You could call these the “community group rules.” OK, they aren’t really “rules” – but they are definitely expectations.  \n  \n  \n  \nEach person approaches community with a unique set of expectations, and it’s really important that those are clearly expressed, and that the group accurately reflects the expectations of the members in it, as well as those of the church. People have to know exactly what they are getting into, and then commit to being a part of it. If they fully know what to expect and fully [commit to it](http://www.watermark.org/media/why-commit/2241/), they won’t leave won’t leave [when things get tough](http://theporch.wpengine.com/loving-the-messy-bits/).  \n  \n  \n  \nBelow are some typical expectations that community group members have of one another. Your group’s list might have some different things on it, or some details might change. That’s OK, as long as you all agree on them, and they line up with the vision for biblical community.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Community Group Rules**  \n\n  \n1. **Trust is key.** What is said within the group stays within the group. This is [a safe place](http://theporch.wpengine.com/circle-of-trust/), where group members can freely share everything in an environment that fosters deep confidence and trust with one another over time. If widening the circle is the most loving thing to do to help someone in a given situation, those steps of trust will be taken together as a group, as well.\n  \n2. **Honesty and openness are the standard.** You should talk about the kinds of accountability that the group will practice. There are two types of honesty in accountability: simply not lying, or actively telling the truth and [not holding back important information](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community-unmasking-the-dark-side/). It takes some time to build this level of trust, but your group should expect to be completely authentic with one another.\n  \n3. **Be there, unless it’s an emergency or an agreed-upon absence.** “Attendance” means you are at the meeting, prepared, and you participate.We get it – life happens! Family events come up, or work emergencies, or maybe an illness. But you all should be on the same page for what is an OK reason to miss group. Your favorite TV show’s season finale? (Hint: NOPE!) A sports game? If you’ve agreed to a weekly meeting time but miss regularly, you may not be putting a high enough priority on community.\n  \n4. **We start on time.** Not “when the last person gets there.” That doesn’t respect everyone else. Honor one another’s time by being on time yourself. If something does cause you to be late, communicate that well with others in the group.\n  \n5. **It's a commitment.** Paul says in Galatians 5 that _faithfulness_ is a fruit of the Spirit that should be evident in the life of a believer. It doesn’t mean you can’t get married and therefore join a different community group for married couples, or get a new job and move, but if you’re still in Dallas and in the single life stage, we want to see faithfulness be a hallmark of all of our communities.\n  \n  \nThere are lots of other expectations that you should be aligned on, such as how much time you’ll spend together during the week, or what you’ll actually do during group time. But this list will get you started in actually meeting together!  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat “rules” or expectations have you found helpful in community?"},"url":{"en-US":"community-group-rules-5-expectations-as-you-get-started"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/community-group-rules-5-expectations-as-you-get-started/"}}},

But sometimes, or according to some people, God seems to not answer particular prayers. Why is that?  \n  \n  \n  \n**What Prayer Is**  \n  \nPart of it is because many people—myself included, for a long time—have a misunderstanding of what prayer is. I talked about this in more depth last week at Watermark ([which you can watch here](http://www.watermark.org/media/power-of-prayer/2665/)), but prayer is simply a conversation with God. It is talking with God, and its purpose is largely to help align us with what God is doing as He invites us to play a role in it.  \n  \n  \n  \nQuestions about why God doesn’t answer a prayer are always about times when we ask God to do something. And for some people, that is all prayer is: a room service line, or perhaps a 911 call. It’s all requests, all the time. To me, that doesn’t sound much like a conversation.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’m certainly not saying you should never request anything from God, but that is not the only thing prayer is about. Instead of a room service line, prayer is more like a walkie-talkie on a battlefield. We constantly radio in about the situation, and ask God what He would have us do: charge over there, bind someone’s wounds over here, or wait over in this area. God is up to something, and we get to take part—but we’re not giving the orders.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Can You Hear Me Now?**  \n  \nAll that said, there actually are places in the Bible where it talks about God not hearing people’s prayers. Not that He can’t hear, but that He doesn’t listen.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs it says in Isaiah 59:1-2,  \n  \n  \n  \n_Surely the arm of the Lord is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear. But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear._  \n  \n   \n  \nThe chapter [kind of goes on from there](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah%2059&version=NIV) to describe the people in ever-less-flattering terms. Basically, if you are committed to living in unrepentant sin, you are not really concerned with God’s plans and shouldn’t expect Him to include you in His work. You won’t hear from Him, because there is too much static on the line.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Bible includes other examples of when God will not hear your prayers:\n\n  \n- When you are focused on the appearances of religion, rather than caring for others ([Isaiah 58:1-12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah%2058:1-12&version=NIV)).\n  \n- For married folks, if you are not considerate of your spouse, which is God’s will for marriage ([1 Peter 3:7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20peter%203:7&version=NIV)).\n  \n- If you do not trust God ([James 1:6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:6&version=NIV)).\n  \n- If you ask for something with selfish motives, and without regard for what God wants ([James 4:3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204:3&version=NIV)).\n  \n- Related to the above, if you ask for something that is not in accordance with God’s will ([1 John 5:14](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:14&version=NIV)).\n  \n  \nI always thought that was a cop-out Christian answer to why doesn’t God hear my prayers. Now, I realize that prayer is as much about understanding His will as expressing ours. Jesus provides a good example for us (of course). Facing knowledge of His own impending crucifixion, He went at night to a garden and prayed:  \n  \n  \n  \n_“Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.” – Luke 22:42_  \n  \n   \n  \nNow, if God was going to answer the prayer of anyone, it would be Jesus, right? I mean, it’s His only Son we’re talking about, and the only person who never did anything wrong. So did God answer that prayer?  \n  \n  \n  \nYes and no. God did not take away that “cup” of crucifixion, so it might seem like an unanswered prayer. But Jesus also prayed that God’s will be done, and it was; God’s will was to use the crucifixion to save all of us from the penalty of sin. Through Jesus’ death, we get eternal life. That’s a really good plan long-term, but I'd have a hard time seeing that in the moment..  \n  \n  \n  \nGod is up to something, and someday we will see the “why” behind every seemingly unanswered prayer.   \n  \n  \n  \nOh, and there is one other reason why God would not hear our prayers, and it is probably the most common reason of all: because we don’t pray.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat are you praying for?  \n  \n  \n  \n- [JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)"},"url":{"en-US":"when-god-doesnt-hear"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/when-god-doesnt-hear/"}}},

My last year in high school, after a bad break-up, gave birth to the beginning of a dark road to sin.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn college, I didn’t know anyone, which led to isolation and depression. Most of the college kids were living the college student life of partying, drinking, and getting high. Even though I was thankful that I didn’t have the urge to partake in those activities, I became desperate for some company. One day I came across an online dating site and from then on I was hooked.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Looking for Love**  \n  \nI felt I wasn’t going to be able to find love anywhere else so I tried this new approach. The first guy I met online was nice but I wasn’t attracted to him. This became the cycle of how I would meet guys online and soon became a terrible addiction to seek out life and fulfillment from a guy.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe desperation took a turn for the worse. I engaged in premarital sex with men who wooed me into thinking they cared for my heart, but only later finding out their care was to simply receive pleasure. These guys that I put my trust and faith in after only a week or two made it all disappear in a flash after spending one hour with me. After each guy, the one place I found myself always visiting was the doctor’s office for HIV/STD testing.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy life was the epitome of Proverbs 26:11, “As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.” Time and time again I would repeat the same foolishness. I pursue a guy, we meet and talk, and he gains my trust, leads me into his devilish schemes, has his way with me, and leaves me nothing but a possible death sentence hanging over my head. I would go to church on Sundays and pray to God, “I want to do better, I’m not going to do that anymore, I can and will get better, please forgive me. Amen.” That was my prayer again and again.  \n  \n  \n  \nAfter going in and out of inappropriate relationships, getting ready to graduate from college, I was visiting my last HIV/STDs test. The person who ran the test always asks me this question, “Do you plan on continuing to be sexually active?” My answer was, without hesitation, “No, I’m done,” and tears were streaming down my eyes. It wasn’t me it was my soul saying I’m done, I’m tired, I surrender!  \n  \n  \n  \n**Finally Found**  \n  \nI grew up going to church and always heard and read about Jesus. I knew that He died for all of our sins but never understood how it applied to my life. A girl I knew from work was holding Bible studies at her house and invited me. She talked to us about the gospel and how “the Son of Man came to seek and save the lost” (Luke 19:10). She went on explaining that Jesus Christ died for past, present, and future sins so that we could be made right with God through Christ ([2 Corinthians 5:21](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21&version=NIV)). I remember it like it was yesterday…my eyes were opened to the truth. I never had a relationship with Christ because of all the sin in my life. He didn’t die to punish me; He did it to set me free. He saved me when I couldn’t save myself. I couldn’t, but He did!  \n  \n  \n  \n_Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come! – 2 Corinthians 5:17_  \n  \n  \n  \n[I once was lost but now I am found](http://theporch.wpengine.com/amazing-grace-lyrical-theology/). While I sought out to be in relationships with immoral men, He desperately sought to be in relationship with me. My relationship with Christ is flourishing day by day, and I am no longer a slave to sin. Just when I thought He gave up on me, He was right there with me.

The starting gun goes off, and your new community group is off and running! For a few hundred singles who are about to finish up our Summer GroupLink, this will be their situation in just a couple of weeks.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhether you’re about to kick off a new GroupLink group, or you’ve formed your own new group organically, starting strong is important! It helps to build momentum quickly, and sets you up well to “run with perseverance the race marked out for [you]” (Hebrews 12:1b).  \n  \n  \n  \nHere are a few ways to get your new group up to speed and running strong:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Start social.**  \n  \nThe best way to start your community group is to get to know each other in a relaxed social setting. When you get together for the first time, grab dinner or do something else fun, so that you can enjoy each other’s company and break the ice before you get into serious study or accountability. A huge key to successful long-term community is having a lot of fun together, and starting this way puts a priority on fellowship. If you’re new to town and have no idea of what to do in Dallas, [here are some ideas to get you started](http://www.visitdallas.com/things-to-do/sights-and-attractions/)!  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Get on the same page.**  \n  \n[Our last community blog post](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community-group-rules-5-expectations-as-you-get-started/) encouraged each group to set some basic expectations for one another, such as keeping discussions confidential, and showing up on time. It’s important to establish things like this, but your group needs to be on the same page for some deeper things as well.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe call this “[aligning expectations](http://www.watermark.org/fileadmin/Community_Group_Resources/Leader_Documents/CGI_Alignment_Questions.pdf)”, and doing this well at the start of your group will help you avoid a bunch of potential misunderstandings and confusion later. It will be a topic covered more fully in our upcoming kickoff event for new GroupLink groups, but you should all be on the same page for things like:  \n\n  \n- What will our meeting time look like? What will we be studying, and how much outside prep should we do?\n  \n- How much time should we expect to spend together during the week outside of group time?\n  \n- How will we approach accountability?\n  \n  \n**3. Don’t be “That Guy” or “That Girl.”**  \n  \nWe’ve seen a lot of successful community groups, but there are some that struggle to get going, usually for similar reasons. To start strong, it’s really important to avoid certain things that detract from building community. We’d encourage you to not be “That Guy” or “That Girl” who:  \n\n  \n- Attends inconsistently.\n  \n- Only shares surface-level stuff.\n  \n- Doesn’t back up opinions with Scripture.\n  \n- Is disengaged during group time.\n  \n- Only interacts with the group during scheduled times.\n  \n  \n**4. Make growth a priority.**  \n  \nTo grow together as a community group, it takes work! Each person in the group needs to make growing together a priority. Here are some things that will kick-start your growth as a group, and keep it going for the long haul:  \n\n  \n- Plan a getaway or retreat in the first couple of months. These are powerful bonding experiences that really get relationships going.\n  \n- Share candidly what God is teaching you every week.\n  \n- Pray for each other consistently throughout the week, and let people know that you’re praying for them.\n  \n- Find ways to share ownership of the group, so that everyone feels like they are playing an important part.\n  \n  \nOur team is praying for your as your new group gets started! We’re so excited for you to start experiencing the blessing and growth that comes from living together in authentic biblical community.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Photo at top courtesy of Creative Commons: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/53370644@N06/4975884671](http://www.flickr.com/photos/53370644@N06/4975884671)/_"},"url":{"en-US":"community-first-steps-4-ways-to-start-strong"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/community-first-steps-4-ways-to-start-strong/"}}},

A few have even lamented that they can’t decide whether they should marry or break up—which is a strange dilemma. If one is an option, the other shouldn't be.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are dating someone and do desire marriage in your life, though, those actually _are_ the only two options that make sense long-term: either you are moving towards an eventual marriage, or you are moving towards an eventual break-up.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo how do you know which one it is? Here are some questions that might help you decide whether you should get married.  \n  \n\n\n  \n- **Are they (and you) fully committed to Christ?** If so, it should be evident in every area of the person’s life. Someone who is committed should be a member of His bride, the church; be known there and growing in biblical community; and be serving Him with their time, talents, and treasure. God created marriage, and it works best when you have two people committed to following Him first and foremost. ([2 Corinthians 6:14](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20corinthians%206:14&version=NIV))\n  \n- **Are they (and you) willing to fully commit to each other?** Consider the vows you will make: things like “in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, till death do us part.” If anything other than death is a potential deal-breaker, you really should include that in the vows: “till you cheat on me with my best friend do us part.” You can be certain that troubles will come, and the only way to ensure your marriage will last is if both parties commit to it _no matter what_. ([Mark 10:9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%2010:9&version=NIV))\n  \n- **Do you have the approval of other committed believers around you?** Do those who know you both best think it is a good idea? This is one of the reasons why it is important to be in a community of people who know you well, have your best interests in mind, and are yielded to the Spirit and God’s Word. ([Proverbs 15:22](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%2015:22&version=NIV))\n  \n- **Would they make a great spouse and parent?** There are roles each person plays within marriage. Do they fill these roles well? ([Ephesians 5:21-33](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%205:21-33&version=NIV))\n  \n- **Do they have good character?** Have they demonstrated themselves to be trustworthy? Do they do what they say they will do? You are trusting them to keep a pretty big promise when they say “I do.” ([Luke 16:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2016:10&version=NIV))\n  \n  \nBut what if they might not be “the one”? You know, that mythical unicorn-riding soulmate who is perfect for you in every way? They aren't “the one” until you choose to marry them. There is not just one, but many people who potentially would make an incredible spouse for you. You are simply looking for someone who meets these criteria, and for whom you can answer “yes” on the above questions. You then create “the one” for each other when you both choose to commit to each other for the rest of your life. [  \n](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-love/)  \n  \n  \n  \nFact is, you’ll never find anyone who is perfect. And that's good, because you're not. And though it certainly helps if you share common interests or have similar personalities, those are nowhere near as important as the items listed above. (Plus, it is difficult to support that biblically when the Bible was written in a time of arranged marriages.)  \n  \n  \n  \nYou need to be able to live with them in an understanding way, care for, and cherish them. If you know you can't, break up.  \n  \n  \n  \n- [JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[What is Love?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-love/)  \n[Don't Date This Woman](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dont-date-this-woman/)  \n[Don't Date This Man](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dont-date-this-man/)"},"url":{"en-US":"should-we-get-married"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/should-we-get-married/"}}},

Up until then, I had been a good kid. I “asked Jesus to come live in my heart” in Vacation Bible School when I was eight, made great grades, and stayed out of trouble. But then I gave this boy the most special thing I could give anyone—my virginity. It wasn’t long after that he broke up with me.  \n  \n  \n  \nFriends (and even family) told me to get over it and move on, but I couldn’t move on so I thought I would save everyone the trouble of consoling me and worrying about me and just take my own life. At the age of fifteen I attempted suicide, not once, but twice.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Worldly Solutions Failed**  \n  \nI wish I could say it was in that moment I decided to start following Christ, but I didn’t. I continued to live a reckless lifestyle. Although I did well in high school and the first part of my college career, I still pursued a worldly lifestyle by choosing to do drugs, having life-sucking relationships with men, and partying.  \n  \n  \n  \nLost, doing poorly in school, and desperately needing out of the party scene, I decided I needed a break. So I enlisted in the Navy, where I really started to grow closer to Christ with the help of my petty officer. She repeatedly asked me if I trusted the Lord and every time I would reply, “Yes…but… [insert any excuse here].” She kindly pointed out that when you trust the Lord, there is no “but”—it’s simply “yes” or “no.”  \n  \n   \n  \n**Giving It All to God**  \n  \nSuddenly, I felt convicted to share one of the most devastating parts of my past—my suicide attempts—with the Navy. Despite the seven year gap since the occurrences, attempted suicide was a disqualifier and I was sent home. The day I returned home from Illinois, I prayed to God, “Okay, I get it. [I’m not in control; You are](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-is-in-control/). I’ll listen.” This was the moment I finally gave it all to God. I started going back to church, getting involved, serving and pursuing a relationship with Christ. But in all of this, something still didn’t feel right.  \n  \n  \n  \nJP has said it countless times: “Change your playground and change your playmates.” I finally took his advice to heart and made more changes in my life, purging unhealthy relationships. Although I was making progress, I was [living in isolation](http://theporch.wpengine.com/no-more-isolation-island/), which is not what God wants for us. Scripture says in [Hebrews 10:24-25](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A24-25&version=NIV) that we should not neglect meeting together and encouraging one another, and [Ecclesiastes 4:9-12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ecclesiastes%204:9-12&version=NIV) says that “a cord of three strands is not quickly broken.”  \n  \n  \n  \n[Getting in a community group](http://theporch.wpengine.com/plugging-in-six-ways-to-get-connected-in-community/) has been, hands down, one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life. There have been several instances when we spend the entire meeting time resolving conflict and praying for one another because someone is struggling or hurting.  \n  \n  \n  \nSaying “yes” to God hasn’t made for the easiest journey, but it is definitely worth it. Through community, I have been reminded of 1 Peter 4:8 which says “Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.” [God’s grace is abounding](http://theporch.wpengine.com/amazing-grace-lyrical-theology/); it is big enough to cover my attempts at suicide, drug abuse, sexual immorality, depressions, doubts, _everything_. He is bigger than you, bigger than me, bigger than this world, and He’s always got your back.  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

I get asked that question all the time, in reference to physical boundaries when dating. Basically, what sexual activity is allowed?  \n  \n  \n  \nThe world’s so-called wisdom would typically say that “it depends.” That’s not very helpful. It suggests that there is an answer (there is a “too far”), but it is impossible to really say what the answer is.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd really, there is no good answer to that question—because it’s the wrong question. Follow me here.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Too Close**  \n  \nWe’ve already established that [sex before marriage is a sin](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/). (God invented sex, and in marriage He is all for it.) Premarital sex is a sin not because God wants to steal our joy, but rather the opposite: He wants what is best for us, and [premarital sex has many negative consequences](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/) and no long-term benefits. So before marriage, we know that sex itself definitely fits in the category of “too far.”  \n  \n  \n  \nSo when unmarried Christ-followers ask me “How far is too far?” what they generally mean is “How close to sex can we get without sinning?”  \n  \n  \n  \nTo which I might ask: “Why are you trying to get close to sin?”  \n  \n  \n  \n**Get Off the Roof**  \n  \nSay we’re standing on top of a building (for some reason) and you ask how close you can get to the edge. Why do you want to get close to the edge? Do you want to jump off?  \n  \n  \n  \nIs it because getting close to the edge is exciting? There is only one reason why it is exciting: because there is a very real chance you might fall off.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you want exciting, you could inch forward and try to balance on the very edge of the roof. I mean, that’s _really_ exciting. Unfortunately, it is also really stupid.  \n  \n  \n  \nSome people would respond to the question by giving advice that makes it somewhat less dangerous to get close to the edge. Like “wear shoes that give you good traction” or “have a parachute nearby.” But that still doesn’t give you any reason why you should try to get close to the edge.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe only truly wise advice I could give you is to stay as far away from the edge as possible.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Flee**  \n  \nThe Bible says to “Flee from sexual immorality” (1 Corinthians 18a). If you are fleeing something, you’re not concerned with how close you can get to it. You’re concerned with how far away you can get from it.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is a different mindset, of trying to be as holy as possible rather than trying to get away with something.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat does that look like in a dating relationship? As I mentioned in the “[Dating Decisions](http://www.watermark.org/media/dating-decisions/2677/)” talk, if your body starts preparing to have sex, then you've gone too far. You are not following God's life-giving instruction to “flee.” If that means you can’t even be in a room together alone before the honeymoon, so be it.  \n  \n  \n  \nI know that is radically counter-cultural in today’s world, but increasingly that should be seen as a good sign—we should be radically different from this world (see [Philippians 2:15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:15&version=NIV), for instance). Jesus was kind of radical, when He said we shouldn’t just not murder or commit adultery; we shouldn’t even think about it ([Matthew 5:21-30](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%205:21-30&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd I’m not trying to be legalistic; just pointing out what is wise, God-honoring, and in turn life-giving. Some would argue that the wise thing is to “try it before you buy it,” but that would mean you are trusting in the world’s wisdom, not God’s wisdom. Statistically, the world has a really, REALLY bad track record. I’ve [experienced the consequences myself](http://theporch.wpengine.com/getting-away-with-it/) of not following God’s design in this area, and I am now confident His ways are superior.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow far is too far when it comes to trusting God?

Ask many Christian singles, and this is a question that requires advanced calculus and graduate-level Facebook stalking to get right. _(Editor’s note: That’s a joke. Get off Facebook.)_  \n  \n  \n  \nThe problem is choice. Usually having choices is considered a good thing, but you run into problems when there are _too many_ choices.  \n  \n  \n  \nHere’s what I mean:  \n  \n  \n  \nIf I need toothpaste, I’ll go to the store and get toothpaste. If there are only two types of toothpaste, I will decide almost instantly, and feel pretty certain about my choice. But if there are 8 different brands of toothpaste and 14 different varieties for each brand, it will take me longer to decide, and I won’t be as certain that I made the right choice. Do I need tartar control? Fluoride? Peroxide? Am I even supposed to put that kind of stuff in my mouth?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Dating Choices**  \nThe same issue of having too many choices may be part of the reason why more people are staying single these days. In the past, more people lived in rural areas, where there are fewer dating choices—and where, despite this, the marriage rate is higher than in cities like Dallas.  \n  \n  \n  \nAccording to the Census Bureau, there are 4.8 million people in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. So let’s say you are a single guy here, between the ages of 20 and 39, looking for a single girl of a similar age. Based on the latest figures—let’s see, carry the one—there are 434,169 unmarried young adult women in DFW to choose from. If we do this “Bachelor”-style, you will have your choices narrowed down in approximately 16,000 years. And then you’ll break up.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Narrowing the Field**  \nNow, if you are a fully-committed follower of Christ, and your goal for dating is marriage (as it should be), you really don’t have all that many dating options. And that is a _good_ thing.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt means you can narrow down the list of potential dating partners very quickly. Starting with yourself, in fact; if you are not ready for marriage, there is no good reason to be dating someone right now.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are marriage material, then you can start ruling out everyone else who is not. So what constitutes good “marriage material?” Well, if you are a guy, I would suggest keeping an eye out for:\n\n  \n- [Things you should look for in a girl.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-man-should-look-for-in-a-woman/)\n  \n- [Things you should _avoid_ in a girl.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dont-date-this-woman/)\n  \n  \nIf you are a single girl, consider:  \n\n  \n- [Things you should look for in a guy.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-woman-should-look-for-in-a-man/)\n  \n- [Things you should _avoid_ in a guy.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dont-date-this-man/)\n  \n  \nNote that this rules out anyone that you don’t know (unless, perhaps, you have a trusted mutual friend who can vouch for the person and initiate an “arranged marriage”). That in itself narrows the list of choices down to a more manageable number. It also rules out anyone who is not a believer, since [2 Corinthians 6:14-15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%206:14-15&version=NIV) (and basic logic) states that you wouldn’t want to date and marry someone who disagrees with you on the foundational truth of your life.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe main point overall is that you are looking for someone who is at least as committed to Christ as you are (and that should be very committed). The more committed you are, the fewer people you will have to choose from.  \n  \n  \n  \nAgain, that is a _good_ thing. It really is. It should be an encouragement to you, not a discouragement. Here’s why:  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Needles**  \nIf you are trying to find “the one” and you have 400,000 people to choose from, you are looking for a needle in a haystack. I don’t know if you are familiar with haystacks, but they are full of hay. There is no reason to expect you’ll find a needle there. (See also the high divorce rate, which occurs _after_ people have searched and dated and bet their life that they had found “the one.”)  \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment\\_5640\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"301\"][![Now if I could just find my haystack…](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/needle.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/needle.jpg) Now if I could just find my haystack…[/caption]  \n  \nBut if you restrict the search to the few truly godly men or women you know, and make that your basis for choosing who to date, then you are searching for a needle…in a tiny pincushion…that contains only needles.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn other words, though it is a really small group of people, any of them would make a great choice. You are “compatible” on the one thing that really matters, and are both following the only One who truly knows how to make relationships last. Just choose.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s simple. Be someone sold out for Jesus, and find someone sold out for Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)"},"url":{"en-US":"who-should-i-date"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/who-should-i-date/"}}},

I thought I knew what being a Christian was all about, and felt like as long as I lived life by “the rules” that I would get what I wanted (as long as what I wanted was good).  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you had asked me ten years ago where I expected to be by this point in my life, I thought I would be working a great job, have a family, and be living in a home with a white picket fence. But what I thought I was entitled to was very different than what God gave me.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Legalism**  \n  \nI became a Christian at the age of 10. I knew who God was, knew that God’s Son died for my sins, and thought I knew what it looked liked to live a “Christian” lifestyle. But legalism ruled my life, and I thought that as long as I obeyed my parents and didn’t do anything _too_ bad then God would give me my heart’s desire. He put those desires there for a reason, right?  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen I started college I had never been out of a Christian environment. My college friends would drink and sleep around, but because I didn’t do those things, I felt like my sins weren’t as bad. After a couple years of college I decided to try cosmetology school instead, and thrived. Again, I was in an environment devoid of God, so I felt like I would have it easy once I graduated and started to work.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Not What I Wanted**  \n  \nWorking in the salon industry wasn’t as easy as I thought, but life still seemed to be on track for me as I fell in love with my boyfriend. We started talking about getting married, and I felt like God was finally giving me everything I had hoped for. But then my boyfriend broke my heart. Two months later I broke my hand, meaning I couldn’t do my job. I lost the two most important things in my life. It was clear to me that God wasn’t going to give me what I wanted.  \n  \n  \n  \nDevastated, I ran from Him. I [doubted His goodness](http://theporch.wpengine.com/is-god-good/). I doubted [His love](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-love/). I was in so much pain that I refused to seek Him out and search for His will. It took me a long time to go back to my relationship with Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Guiding Heart and Hands**  \n  \nI finally let my heart open up to God. It took a while to put my trust fully in Him, once more. And it really took a lot longer to know what it meant to be pursuing Him and letting Him guide my life. After four years, God has allowed me to return to the salon industry. I prayed that He would guide my decisions and make His will known. I raised my hands to Him and prayed “God, these hands are Yours, and if I never use them in a salon again, I pray that Your work would be done.”  \n  \n  \n  \nFully surrendering my gifts to Him was the best decision I could have ever made. I keep Psalm 19:14, “May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer,” and Proverbs 16:9, “In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps,” close to my heart so I am always reminded that my life, my work, and my goals are dedicated to Him. He has put me where I am as a blessing, not because I deserve it. I’m definitely not where I thought I’d be, I’m someplace better! Living and serving for Him!  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

Never before had I felt so lost, confused, isolated, and alone.  \n  \n  \n  \nI was engaged, with a 2014 wedding date, to the woman I’ve been with for four years. Suddenly, though, I began having feelings of doubt and uncertainty about the upcoming nuptials, and my whole life fell apart around me. I felt strongly convicted that I needed to call it off, and we went our separate ways in early June.  \n  \n  \n  \n**All Alone**  \n  \nI remember asking myself, _“How did I get here? What’s going on?”_ I felt hopeless and scared. I had moved to Dallas after college to be with her, so I had no family or close friends nearby. I’d never truly lived on my own before, and now I was completely alone.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’d grown up in the church, been baptized, and even confirmed. I knew of God, but I didn’t _know_ God. I quickly realized two things: one, merely going to church doesn’t save you. I mean, it’s a definite step in the right direction, but in order to be saved you must trust in Jesus’ work on the cross and submit your whole life to Him. Two, that the answers to the questions I had been asking myself could only come from God, and that it was time to truly reawaken the faith that had been dormant inside me for so long.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Drawing Near**  \n  \nDuring those weeks in June, my dad said something to me I’ll never forget, something I hold very dear to my heart: “Draw near to Him and He will draw near to you. You’re listening and your life will begin to change.” So with these words in mind, I began my journey by simply reading my Bible, which had been given to me by my parents for my confirmation day in 2001. Honestly, that Bible never got a lot of use and it was sort of dusty.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen I made the decision to read God’s Word and seek His counsel, He started doing _incredible_ things in my life, little by little. He caused me to cross paths with Christian coworkers, people whom I had never known were believers. They strengthened my faith and listened and encouraged me to walk with God.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Life Together**  \n  \nOne of them encouraged me to attend The Porch here at Watermark Community Church. I wrestled with that idea. The idea of going to such a huge church was daunting. However, I went, and God started talking to me instantly. The topic those first two weeks was “[Life Together](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/323/),” and I learned that we were never meant to walk through life alone ([Proverbs 18:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+18%3A1&version=NIV) and [Proverbs 27:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2027:17&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \nAfter my first time at The Porch, God placed a Porch volunteer in my path, Ben Caldwell. He prayed with me and encouraged me to have a deeper relationship with God, and to get plugged in at Watermark. So I kept going to The Porch, all the while being directed by God, walking through the doors He opened and listening to the people He placed in my path. I went to an [open community group](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-is-open-community-group/), where I met a lot of guys who were going through similar struggles.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod hasn’t stopped working in my life. I wanted to draw nearer to Him, and God gave me the courage to attend a class at Watermark about making the most out of our quiet time with God, giving me the tools I wanted and needed to strengthen my relationship with Him. He then guided me to sign up for GroupLink, to become part of a [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/) of God-fearing men my age who will lift me up and hold me accountable as we strive to live more fully for Christ. That’s something I would have never done before I asked God to take control of my life and guide me on the path He wants me to take.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Not Alone**  \n  \nGod has calmed the raging seas, and has taken away my anxieties ([1 Peter 5:7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:7&version=NIV)). I now have a smile I’ve never shown before. My message to you is this: [you’re not alone](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community-not-the-only-one/) ([Joshua 1:9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:9&version=NIV)). Don’t turn away from God; run to Him. He loves you and will do awesome things in your life. Don’t be afraid to find shelter in Him. Seek out a community, [step out of your boat](http://theporch.wpengine.com/no-more-isolation-island/), and He will begin to work wonders in your life."},"url":{"en-US":"directing-my-path"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/directing-my-path/"}}},

It is:  \n\n  \n1. A place to learn more about community groups at Watermark, and get information on how to get started in a community group.\n  \n2. A place to meet and relationally connect with peers and new friends of the same gender after The Porch.\n  \n3. A safe environment to share about what is currently going on in your life or in your walk with the Lord, and to hear about others’ lives.\n  \n  \nWe like to say that Open Community Group is a lot like the free samples that you get as you walk down the aisles of Sam’s Club or Whole Foods on a Saturday afternoon—it’s just a taste, a small tease if you will, of the real thing. Open Community Group is a small 45-60 minute sample of what living in authentic biblical community is like.  \n  \nLiving in community involves doing life with one another ([Acts 2:42](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%202:42&version=NIV)), encouraging one another daily ([Hebrews 3:13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%203:13&version=NIV)), spurring one another on towards love and good deeds ([Hebrews 10:24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010:24&version=NIV)), loving one another ([Romans 12:9-10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:9-10&version=NIV)), putting others’ interests before our own ([Philippians 2:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:4&version=NIV)), and so many other great things!  \n  \nRealistically, we can’t really cover 100% of that in the short time that we spend in Open Community Group each week. But our hope is to provide a small taste of how the Lord has sweetly designed us to live life with other believers, who will encourage us in our walks with God as we pursue becoming more fully devoted followers of Christ.  \n  \nSo, regardless of whether you are brand new to The Porch or have been around for years, come join us at Open Community Group! You can get connected and learn more about what living life with a community of believers looks like. We meet in the North and South Community Rooms right outside the Worship Center on Tuesday nights, immediately following The Porch. We would absolutely love to have you!  \n  \n_If you have any questions, please post them in the comments below._  \n\n  \n- A place to learn more about community groups at Watermark, and get information on how to get started in a community group.\n  \n- A place to meet and relationally connect with peers and new friends of the same gender after The Porch.\n  \n- A safe environment to share about what is currently going on in your life or in your walk with the Lord, and to hear about others’ lives.\n  \n"},"url":{"en-US":"what-is-open-community-group"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-is-open-community-group/"}}},

Because of this, I grew up trying to be good and do things right, the way Jesus did. But without true knowledge of Him and His ways, I consistently fell short. I eventually stopped trying so hard to be “good.” There was a void in my life that I continually tried to fill by gaining the approval of others, improving my physical appearance, increasing my store of earthly treasures, partying in college, and so on.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe first time I heard someone speak of Jesus' grace and salvation as a free gift was not until graduate school, when I met my best friend, Nicole. She and I grew close during grad school, and she consistently pointed me toward truth as we pursued our education. After some time, it became clear to me that she had something that I did not: a ceaseless joy, a certain beautiful grace that I was unable to imitate no matter what I tried. It was about the time that we both relocated to Dallas that I realized—that light in her was Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \nI wanted to know more. A friend directed us to Watermark, and specifically to the Porch ministry. Through Nicole's discipling, diving into community, and hearing truth consistently spoken at Watermark, I finally understood and accepted that I am a sinner who is unable to do anything on my own that would make me right with God. But, in Jesus' death for my sins and His victorious resurrection, I am justified. Romans 6:23 taught me that “the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is everlasting life through Christ Jesus our Lord.” This verse is so meaningful to me as it reminds me that Christ's provision for my eternal life is a gift; I've done nothing to deserve or earn it.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis realization set me free from my struggle to make people think I was good, and has allowed me to let Christ show His love and goodness to others through me. I acknowledge that anything I do well is not through my own power. Jesus has changed the relationships I seek and the way I manage them, the way I spend my time and money, and the way I look at life. He continues to convict me to grow in patience, to trust Him more fully, and to serve and love others in a way that glorifies Him. I'm so thankful for the love and mercy He shows me every day!"},"url":{"en-US":"trying-to-be-good"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/trying-to-be-good/"}}},

[Who should I date?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-should-i-date/) [Should we get married?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-we-get-married/) [Should I change jobs?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-to-do-if-you-hate-your-job/)  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is good that you are interested in doing what God wants. However, sometimes people can fret unnecessarily about specifics or worry about somehow messing up God’s plan for their lives. (You can’t. You’re not that powerful.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**What Scripture Says**  \nIf you want to hear from God and know His will, the first place to look is in the Bible.  \n  \n  \n  \nDid you know that the Bible does clearly say what God’s will is for our lives? As in, it literally says “God’s will is…” and then tells us what that is. Here are some examples:\n\n  \n- In John 6:40, Jesus Himself says: “For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”\n  \n- 1 Thessalonians 4:3-6a: “It is God’s will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable,not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God; and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister.”\n  \n- 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18: “Rejoice always, pray continually, **<sup> </sup>** give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.”\n  \n  \nThere are many other examples, but they all tend to boil down to those same things:  \n\n  \n- It is God’s will that you be saved. This is the big one that makes everything else rather trivial. God offers eternal life, and He wants you to have it so badly that He sacrificed His Son so that you could freely enter in.\n  \n- It is God’s will that you avoid sin—not because that gives you eternal life (see above), but because things will go better for you and for everyone around you if you do.\n  \n- It is God’s will that you live out your life in fellowship with Him and focus on what is good (and all good things come from God).\n  \n  \n**Right or Wrong vs. Right or Left**  \nSo, if you are facing a decision and one option is clearly a sin, you don’t have to think about it very long.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut what if it is not a case of right versus wrong? Choosing a career, for example, is a morally neutral decision (unless you are considering becoming a drug dealer or something). How can you discern God’s will in the grey areas?  \n  \n  \n  \nThe answer is: you don’t need to.  \n  \n  \n  \nPart of God’s plan was to give us free will. We have the freedom to make our own choices. Beyond the guidelines that are clearly stated, and the wisdom principles in Scripture, we can do whatever we want.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Backyard Boundaries**  \nIt’s like when my girls go to play in the backyard. I give them two boundaries: stay within the fence, and stay away from the pool. Those boundaries are just for their safety, because I want them to have a good time, and getting hurt or lost is not fun. But they can do whatever they want within those boundaries, and they don’t need to be constantly asking their father what to do.  \n  \n  \n  \n“Daddy, can we go down the slide?” Sure. Just stay within the fence and away from the pool.  \n  \n  \n  \n“Daddy, should we slide or do the monkey bars?” Baby girl, I don’t care what you do. Just stay in the fence and away from the pool.  \n  \n  \n  \n“Can we play in the street?” Of course not. That’s not within the fence and you will get hurt.  \n  \n  \n  \n“Can we ride our tricycles around?” Absolutely. That’s why I gave them to you. Just keep them away from the pool, because you can’t swim and tricycles don’t float.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is roughly the same with us: we have clear boundaries and warnings, which are there for our own good. As long as we observe those guidelines, God is happy to let us make our own choices.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Making Decisions**  \nIf you are facing a big grey area decision, I would say to pray about it, and seek wise counsel from the Scriptures and community. You can check out [the current Sunday series at Watermark (titled “Should I?”)](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/329/) for some good advice on making wise choices. But at some point you do have to choose, and trust that God knows what He is doing in giving us that freedom.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn what areas of your life are you worried about figuring out God’s will?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)"},"url":{"en-US":"what-is-gods-will-for-my-life"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-is-gods-will-for-my-life/"}}},

My parents did not teach me the Truth about God; my mother instead taught me that virgins do not have babies and that Jesus was not the Son of God. My mother even had a bumper sticker that said “Born okay the first time.” My parents were drug addicts, and I spent most of my teen years being the adult in my home. My mother fell very ill when I was 14 years old and I had to step up into the mom role of our home. I was a \"good kid\"—I excelled in school programs and made great grades. However, I was living a double life. I sought love and attention from men and ran around Dallas with people much older than I was. I was happy for the most part, but on the inside, I was dead.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Crumbled**  \nMy boyfriend went off to the Air Force a year before I graduated high school, and once I finished school I ran off to live with him in Little Rock. After his first deployment to Afghanistan, we got married. We were both only 19 years old.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy mother passed away shortly after we got married and I completely crumbled. I was so depressed, and my husband was so tired of trying to fix me. I was sure he and everyone else would be happier if I were dead. After three more deployments, and with life taking a toll on us, my husband asked for a divorce. Only three years of marriage and he was done.  \n  \n  \n  \nI was crushed. I thought the death of my mother was bad but this sent me even further down a hole that I couldn't get out of. All of this happened around my 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday. I remember lying in my bed all night, crying and just downright broken. I hurt myself on purpose. I wanted to die.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Getting Past the Lies**  \nAs a last-ditch effort to find a reason to survive, I began to search for YouTube videos of motivational speakers for encouragement. I happened to come across some sermons that significantly lifted my spirits and made me understand that life can get better.  \n  \n  \n  \nI was missing one thing though—Jesus. I wanted it so bad but I couldn't get my mind past what my mother had taught me about Christianity being a lie. I met with a friend who had a relationship with God and she taught me so much. The night after our discussion and after listening to yet another sermon I fell on my knees, crying my eyes out asking for Jesus to come into my heart and for Him to heal me. I realized that life without Him was miserable and worthless. I wanted, needed Him. In Luke 19:10 Jesus said “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.” Jesus never stopped seeking me and He saved me mightily.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Regenerated Life**  \n  \nSince that day I can’t get enough of God. I have now been attending Watermark and am in the process of becoming a member. I am trying to learn as much as I possibly can to catch up from my years in the dark. I spend time every morning reading my Bible. The day just isn’t right if I don’t make time to spend with God! Proverbs 3:5-6 says “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.”  \n  \n  \n  \nAs a result of this journey God has brought me on, my dad has started attending Watermark, and is even going to [re:generation](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery/), with me. A friend of mine also saw the positive changes in me and asked for my secret. She is struggling with addiction, and after I shared my faith with her she now also has a new life in Christ. I am also working to restore my marriage with my husband. God is working all around me.  \n  \n  \n  \nI do not know what the future holds for me, but each day I make the choice to give it over to God. As Jeremiah 29: 11 says, “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” I know and trust that His plan and purpose can excel me further than I can ever imagine doing alone. My life is brand new and I will never go back to who I once was."},"url":{"en-US":"exchanging-lies-for-truth"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/exchanging-lies-for-truth/"}}},

I skipped school once, had an amazing time with friends, and got busted. The \"crime\" cost me 9 pops (spankings at school) and in-school suspension. It was worth it!  \n  \n  \n  \nI think this is how some people view hell. They are hedging their bets. Maybe they can have lots of fun here, and sure, maybe they go to hell, but was it worth it? What is hell, anyway?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Hell on Earth**  \n  \nThe Bible uses a few different words for hell, but the most prominent is “Gehenna.” Gehenna was a real place. It was a valley outside Jerusalem where children were once sacrificed by fire, and which then became a burial ground and a trash dump. It was a place of death, with an ongoing flame from burning garbage and sulphur. The name Gehenna was used not because that valley actually is hell, but because it provided the best earthly example of what hell would be like.  \n  \n  \n  \nHell is not a punishment that lasts for a season and then you are let out. It is also not annihilation, where you are snuffed out and exist no more. Hell is eternal. It is forever. In a thousand years, it will still be like the first day for those who are there. In a billion years, there is still an eternity left on the sentence. I do not know if there is literally a fire there, but the experience is similar to being burned alive, as this is often the imagery used in Scripture.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Eternal Regret**  \n  \nThe first thing that happens in hell is that you realize you do deserve to be there. In [Luke 16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016:19-31&version=NIV), the rich man never denies that he deserved hell. He is not angry at God, because it is not God’s fault. You will not shake your fist at God in hell; rather, you will hang your head in shame.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe man in hell in Luke 16 can see heaven. He is in a place of eternal regret. He realizes what he could have had, and what he will never have. But I think the worst part of hell is the full realization of how good God is. Those in hell realize for eternity that God had pursued them and offered them eternity with Him in His Kingdom, and they rejected Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Hell and Lollipops**  \n  \nMy little girl Presley loves lollipops. One day I brought a lollipop home, eager to give it to her. However, when I walked in, my wife let me know that Presley had not made good choices that day.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen I took Presley into her room to talk to her about it, she responded very poorly. I showed her that I had brought her a lollipop, and let her know that I could not give it to her because of her bad behavior. She screamed. So, I then threw the lollipop away and let her know that she would never have it. She screamed even louder: \"I can do whatever I want!\" (I assure you this is out of character for her).  \n  \n  \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment\\_5440\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"330\"][![Lollipops](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lollipops.jpg \"Lollipops\")](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lollipops.jpg) No lollipops.[/caption]  \n  \nThis was a parenting challenge. So, I went into my “stash.” I had a box of lollipops that Presley didn’t know about. I got them and showed them to her. Dozens of lollipops that I had at my disposal: blowpops, See’s Candy lollipops, even some that were 5\" in diameter! I showed her this box of gold and her eyes filled with hope. I then threw them away. They were gone forever. It was a goodness that Presley didn't even know existed, and now she had the realization that she had missed out on them forever. That’s somewhat like hell on an extremely tiny scale.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Road to Hell**  \n  \nDid you know there is only one thing you can do that will cause you to go to hell? It is not really a particular sin, like murder or theft, because all of us have sinned and therefore all of us deserve the punishment.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo what is the one thing that will cause you to go to hell?  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you reject Jesus Christ as the payment for your sins, then you will have to pay for your sins in hell. If, however, you trust that Jesus did die on the cross as payment for your sins, and you trust that God defeated death by raising Him from the dead, then you will not have to pay for your sins in hell—because Jesus already did.  \n  \n  \n  \n_There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, \"Thy will be done,\" and those to whom God says, in the end, \"Thy will be done.\" All that are in hell, choose it. Without that self-choice there could be no hell. No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seek find. Those who knock it is opened. – C.S.

I didn’t know how to find pleasure in either place.  \n  \n  \n  \nSomeone had recently explained to me that I was sinner and that the wages of my sin is death. I had come to know how Christ paid the penalty for my sins and I had sincerely put my trust in Him for my eternal salvation. I realized now that I was different from my normal friends because of my belief in what God had done for me, but I still felt lost. I had no friends that knew anything about God. I would get calls from “friends” on the weekends asking me to join them out at the bars. That was the only place I knew to go, so I would end up there. While it felt right to be at church, I felt guilty because the night before I was in places that God says are not best for me. I was participating in things that were not healthy for me.

I signed up for GroupLink and that was where I learned that I wasn’t created for isolation. Genesis 2:18a says, “The Lord God said, ‘It is not good for man to be alone.’” God created us for relationships and therefore it is very important for me to have others around me to encourage, admonish, and sharpen me ([Hebrews 3:13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%203:13&version=NIV), [Proverbs 27:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2027:17&version=NIV)). I need others that I can confess my sins to and heal from things in my past ([James 5:16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%205:16&version=NIV)). Having others around to hold me accountable is necessary. When I live life on my own, I tend to justify my actions and can get lost in my own motives, which ends in me doing something that is not beneficial ([Proverbs 14:12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2014:12&version=NIV)). “Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor: If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!” (Ecclesiastes 4:9-10)  \n  \n  \n  \nI see how God uses community to help guide me in making decisions and I know I can trust the men he has put in my life. What is greatest is that I get to know and understand God better through community ([John 17:3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:3&version=NIV)). God has used community to show me a glimpse of Himself, by the way they care, accept, and love me. I have seen compassion, forgiveness, and kindness, which is but a fraction of what God has in store for us one day.  \n  \n  \n  \nNow, I don’t have time to be in the bars nor do I have the desire. My weekends are filled with friends, good fellowship, and meaningful conversations. I am not perfect and still have other areas of struggle but with a group of men dedicated to following Jesus, I have grown in my relationship with God. Community is difficult and will never be ideal, however—with the Holy Spirit and time— God makes everything beautiful ([Ecclesiastes 3:11a](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:3&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \nThrough commitment to the purpose of community, you will be blessed. Trust Him. Jump in."},"url":{"en-US":"changing-playground-and-playmates"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/changing-playground-and-playmates/"}}},

Hinduism is a religion that believes that god can be manifested in many forms. It also believes in karma and the amount of good and bad karma you accumulate determines what your next life (reincarnation) might look like.  \n  \n  \n  \nGrowing up, I watched my parents model honest lives, always looking to help others in any way they knew how. Despite their generosity, our family always seemed to be going through some form of hardship and pain. The pain I saw my family go through all my life only strengthened my faith in god because as far as I knew, he would fix it. I didn't know who god was but I tried as hard as I could to be good so I could know him.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Done With God**  \n  \nOne day, after I moved to Austin for school, my older sister called me crying with a broken heart. Hearing her talk about how hurt she was broke my heart, and I decided I was done with god. I thought he forgot my family and I gave up on him. I didn't think he could be good because he had ignored my prayers for comfort and reassurance all my life and now someone I loved was in despair, again.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs I walked to class after that conversation, I was overwhelmed and the pain I was feeling for my family practically immobilized me. I went inside the nearest building to compose myself. As I looked around, I realized it was a church, saw the cross and desperately prayed, asking Christ if He was real, to heal my family's hurt and to take my life if that meant bringing them happiness. In that moment, after 10 years of pleading with God to comfort me, I felt comfort and peace like I never had in my life. I went forward through college the next four years but never forgot that day.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Talking to Me**  \n  \nI graduated in 2009 and moved to Dallas for a job. A few months after moving, my trust in a guy was betrayed and all the pain in that moment and from the years past that I still carried crashed down on me.  \n  \n  \n  \nI remembered the peace I had four years ago when I prayed to Christ, so I asked the Lord to heal and comfort me again, and as always, He showed up. I’d heard about The Porch from a friend a few months earlier so I decided to go that week. When I heard the speaker explain that God can use suffering to draw us closer to Him, I knew God was talking to me.  \n  \n  \n  \nA volunteer at the Porch, Lauren Murray, befriended me and met with me every Saturday for months to explain why she loved this God so much. Lauren encouraged me to get into community and I begrudgingly heeded, but I spent the next year searching for answers other than Jesus. I focused on my success so I missed community group to work late, thinking the next promotion and job title would satisfy me. I looked for “the one” to marry and put my worth in what guys thought of me. I spent my weekends on McKinney Avenue “living the dream” and waking up to fuzzy memories of the night before.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Tired of the Double Life**  \n  \nFinally, the morning of [Easter](http://theporch.wpengine.com/someone-has-to-pay/) weekend, I woke up and was tired of the way I was living. I was tired of thinking my worth came from whether or not a guy wanted to marry me. I was tired of working for the next promotion. I was tired of thinking I was strong when I was weak. I asked God to help me, to forgive me, to make my ways His ways.  \n  \n  \n  \nI confessed my double life to my community group and those girls came around me and loved me, prayed for me, and reminded me that there is [no condemnation](http://theporch.wpengine.com/no-condemnation/) in Christ ([Romans 8:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%208:1&version=NIV)), that Christ took all that with Him on the cross. After living a life of trying to be good and work my way to try to know God, God came to me in the midst of my brokenness when I had nothing to offer Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n[God’s love](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-he-loves/) and the love of His people attracted me to Christ. The more I learned about who Christ is and the love He displayed on the cross by dying for me, the more beautiful He became. God’s unconditional love has changed every aspect of my life, not by trying harder to change, but by surrendering to the One who never changes."},"url":{"en-US":"from-karma-to-the-cross"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/from-karma-to-the-cross/"}}},

So, to mark Metaxas’ visit, here are seven lessons we can learn from these seven great men:  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. **Great men don’t seek to make their own name great.** Great men become that way by living for something greater than themselves. Though some of the men in the book—most notably, the affluent ladder-climbers Washington and Wilberforce—started out seeking fame, they were included in this list of greats because of their selfless service and willingness to turn down power in order to serve the greater good. And the man who became known as “John Paul the Great” earned that moniker largely because he was so humble. (See also [Matthew 23:12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23%3A12&version=NIV).)\n  \n2. **Bad decisions don’t disqualify you.** Great men have flaws. Sometimes great flaws. Washington famously owned slaves, for example, and Colson was a convicted felon and one of the men responsible for a little scandal called “Watergate.” No one is perfect, but imperfect people can still do great things. ([Romans 3:23-24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:23-24&version=NIV))\n  \n3. **You’ve been prepared.** All of these men achieved great success because their life experiences—and particularly, their hardships and mistakes—ideally [prepared them](http://theporch.wpengine.com/paul-pastor-martyr-murderer-spy/) for their roles. For example, Chuck Colson gave his life to Jesus after his involvement in the Watergate scandal, but then still spent time in prison for his mistakes. As a direct result, he was able to start a ministry called Prison Fellowship, which now helps inmates and their families in the U.S. and more than 100 other countries around the world. ([Ephesians 2:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&version=NIV))\n  \n4. **Beliefs must translate into actions.** Or, as JP often says at The Porch, your actions always follow your beliefs. If you truly believe something, you will act on it. Eric Liddell, known today through the movie _Chariots of Fire_, chose to live out his beliefs and honor God at the expense of a sure shot at Olympic gold in 1924. Some nine decades later, no one remembers who won the gold medal in his place, but Liddell is honored for humbly living out his faith. ([James 2:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%202:17&version=NIV))\n  \n5. **Great men stand up against evil.** There is evil in the world. Sadly, most people stand by and do nothing about it. The Holocaust is the classic example of that. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Christian, had the opportunity to flee to America just before World War II. But he made the choice to return to Germany and work against the Nazi regime, smuggling Jews to safety and even plotting to overthrow Hitler. He was imprisoned and later executed for his actions—a risk he willingly faced because it was the only proper response to such horrors. ([James 1:27](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1:27&version=NIV))\n  \n6. **Change means opposition.** If you are not facing opposition, you are probably not making a difference. William Wilberforce opposed slavery when the practice was widely accepted and fiercely defended by powerful people. With superhuman restraint, Jackie Robinson endured terrible discrimination and hatred when he broke baseball’s color barrier in 1947, effectively becoming the first step towards racial desegregation. Want to [change the world](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-change-the-world/)? You’ll have to go against the flow. ([John 15:18](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:18&version=NIV))\n  \n7. **It takes time.** Contrary to our culture of instant gratification and fame, doing something truly great takes time. Wilberforce was successful at ending the slave trade and abolishing slavery itself, and [it only took him 46 years](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-power-of-being-faithful/). As young adults, you do have that kind of time—if you are willing to commit to something greater than your personal wants and needs.

We are in the building years, trying to establish careers, homes, families, or reputations. And it seems we are hard to satisfy. We are picky. [We keep our options open](http://www.watermark.org/media/why-commit/2241/). We have unrealistic expectations. We are notoriously unhappy and unsatisfied. We always want more. If we just had more, we would be happy.  \n  \n  \n  \nThere is at least one glaring problem with that line of logic, and his name is Solomon.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Better than You**  \n  \nKing Solomon wrote Ecclesiastes, [which we previously studied at The Porch](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/330/), along with a book about romance (Song of Solomon) and the majority of a book about wisdom (Proverbs).  \n  \n  \n  \nHe was also better than you, in pretty much every way.  \n  \n  \n  \nNot just you, but me, A-list movie stars, Fortune 500 CEOs, and every U.S. President. Few people in history have a resume that could match Solomon’s, and most of them have the word “King” (or some variation) in front of their names. Which means that, no matter what you may accomplish with the rest of your life, Solomon will still most assuredly be better than you.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn fact, there is probably not even a single area in life where you could surpass him. Solomon was:\n\n  \n- **Richer than you.** Solomon was the richest person on the face of the earth while he was alive. In today’s dollars, his income in gold alone amounts to almost a billion dollars each year. That’s _income_, not net worth. If you have a coveted six-figure job, you are still only making about 0.01% of what Solomon did.\n  \n- **Smarter than you.** Solomon was the wisest man in the world. Heads of state would travel for weeks and pay great sums just to learn from him.\n  \n- **More powerful than you.** Well, he was king, back when kings had almost limitless power. And he was a king whom other kings paid tribute to.\n  \n- **More famous than you.** Everyone knew who he was. Everyone still knows who he is.\n  \n- **Way more married than you.** Hate weddings because they remind you that you are still single? Imagine being Solomon’s best man: a wedding every weekend, for years and years, and it’s always the same guy getting married. He had 700 wives and 300 live-in girlfriends. This would also suggest he had more sex than you.\n  \n- **Better-looking than you.** Well, at least better-dressed, since [Jesus used him as an example of someone with nice threads](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:27&version=NIV), and that was 1,000 years after the fact. Plus, I hear rumors that money, power, and fame can be attractive.\n  \n- **Better at partying than you.** Based just on the amount of food consumed, it is estimated that Solomon had as many as 15,000 people over for dinner. Every night. On one special occasion, he invited pretty much the whole country, and the menu included 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep and goats.\n  \n- **More successful than you.** See all of the above, and then factor in that he also built fleets of ships, planted forests, and built the temple. He had 30,000 people working for him, and his not-so-humble abode was a palace it took them 13 years to build.\n  \n  \nIn other words, whatever earthly things you might be chasing after, Solomon had them and had them to the absolute max.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Meaningless**  \n  \nIf any of those things had the power to bring happiness, then Solomon should have been the happiest guy on the planet. Ecclesiastes shows us otherwise. Writing the book after he had achieved all of his success, Solomon starts off by getting right to the point:   \n  \n*“Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher. “Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.” Ecclesiastes 1:2*\n  \n  \n \nYou see, there is one benefit to having absolutely everything: you can know for certain that none of it has any true value. The rest of us may falsely believe that we will finally be happy when we have this job, or that amount of money, or this type of relationship. When we get those things and find that we are still not happy, we somehow think that the solution is to get yet more of what we already have. Solomon knows better—he knows it for a _fact_—and is desperately trying, through Ecclesiastes, to keep us from making the same mistake.  \n  \n  \n  \nDon’t repeat the experiment. Don’t waste your life chasing after meaningless things.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo how can you find meaning and happiness and avoid a [1/4 Life Crisis](http://theporch.wpengine.com/media/)?

I am writing this from 30,000 feet in the sky and reflecting on how I often feel extreme temptation when I travel alone (something I rarely do, and avoid if possible).  \n  \n  \n  \nWhether it is the duty-free shopping in the airport, smut on the TV, alcohol in the lobby bars, or just a heightened sense of freedom that is open to sin, it seems to me that temptation increases on the road. Why is that? I believe it is a false feeling of anonymity and freedom from accountability that occurs when we are in foreign surroundings.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut feeling tempted doesn’t mean that you have to give in to that temptation. Remember that “No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it” (1 Corinthians 10:13).  \n  \n  \n  \nI’d like to suggest five tips that might help you avoid falling into temptation on the road:  \n  \n\n\n  \n1. **Schedule time with God**. Make your travel a spiritual retreat by prioritizing still times in the mornings and/or the evenings to pray and study. You can plan a study by tackling a new book in the Bible. Take your journal and document your observations from the text. Or, you may use some of this time to catch up on [sermon podcasts](http://theporch.wpengine.com/media).\n  \n2. **Have accountability back home**. Just because you are not in your hometown does not mean that you don’t have accountability. Have your community group check in on you throughout the trip, and give them specific questions to ask you upon returning. Make sure they know specifically how you are tempted on the road. Leave a copy of your travel plans with them and let them know how they can be praying.\n  \n3. **Disable the adult films in your hotel**. This is a given for me. I usually get weird looks from the lobby, but it has never been a problem. Upon checking in, I simply ask them to disable the adult pay-per-view. I’ve heard that Billy Graham would have the TV itself removed before entering a hotel room.\n  \n4. **Know your weaknesses**. If Satan was going to take you out on this trip, how would he do it? Where would he do it? Would it be in a dark restaurant after a few glasses of wine? Would it be in the hotel bar or at the local mall? How would he take you out? Wage war with [the lion](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:8&version=NIV) who seeks to [steal, kill and destroy](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&version=NIV).\n  \n5. **FOCUS**  **on Jesus**. Victory will not come to you by legalism. While that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t make sin harder to come by, it does mean that at the center of your efforts should be a remembrance of [what Christ has done to purchase your freedom](http://theporch.wpengine.com/someone-has-to-pay/) from sin and death.\n  \n  \nYour trip is just an extension of your mission. Stay on mission. God, in His sovereignty, has sent you there to know Him more and make Him known. Focus on this mission through Christ and do not get distracted by temptation.  \n  \n  \n  \nPraying for that now.  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)"},"url":{"en-US":"5-ways-to-avoid-temptation-when-traveling"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/5-ways-to-avoid-temptation-when-traveling/"}}},

I wasn’t in God’s Word, so this also led to believing the lies college tells you about partying and relationships with guys in general.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt wasn’t until I, on a whim, attended my first Passion conference in Atlanta my collegiate senior year, graduated, and moved to Dallas that I begin to realize how much God desires to be much more than my foundation.  \n  \n  \n  \n**No More Distractions**  \n  \nIt is often said that “God works in mysterious ways.” Well, God knew how much I valued the opinion of others and being surrounded by friends. This, in an abused form, was all very distracting from the life He was calling me to live with Him as my center. So, how did my life look after college? I moved to Dallas, with not a gal pal from school in the area. This led to the inevitable truth I had to live alone, and begin a job I was _not_ good at. No friends, no slap of approval on the back. I was suf-fer-ring. For real. Like embarrassing, crying-on-my-knees-in-a-lonely-apartment suffering. Of course, I tried going out with co-workers and finding distractions in the Dallas bar scene, but that mundane redundancy left me sick physically and spiritually.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s crazy beautiful how God was able to use that loneliness and suffering, though, because this was the first time in a long time where my life allowed for quiet alone time. There weren’t friends running in and out of my apartment or meetings to run to or a job I loved and wanted to become obsessed with. And through this quiet is how God got my attention with that still, strong voice of His.  \n  \n  \n  \n**New Playground and Playmates**  \n  \nEnter [Watermark Women’s Bible Study on Thursday nights](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/womens-bible-study--thursday-night/). I came across the memo on the website, thanks to an apartment leaser mentioning Watermark. The more I invested time at Watermark through The Porch, Women’s Bible study, serving, and Sundays (a.k.a. [the right “playground” and the right “playmates”](http://theporch.wpengine.com/changing-playground-and-playmates/)), the more I freed my grip to make room for God’s hand to grip my life.  \n  \n  \n  \nI remember one Thursday night when my beloved Bible study leader was answering another of my ceaseless self-centered questions like “Did I move to the right city? Did I take the right job? Am I doing things right?” With a question of her own, “Sylvia, do you honestly think what YOU do or don’t do can ruin [God’s plan for you](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-is-gods-will-for-my-life/)?”  \n  \n  \n  \n**More of God and Less of Me**  \n  \nGod defines serene and steadfast love. God allows me to fulfill my heart’s desire of friendship through biblical community with amazing friends that have been made here. But I have realized that at the center of my life, not at the bottom of it all, must always be my Savior.  \n  \n  \n  \nOf course I still struggle with many things and have to give up myself to God every day (I’ve seriously considered a John 3:30 “HE must become greater, I must become less” tattoo on my forehead). Heck, I find myself even wondering what you are thinking of me while reading this. But, no offense, it’s not about you. Or me. It’s about the fact that God has changed my appetite, freed me from those judgmental chains and brought me into new life with HIM as the focus. “I find my strength, I find my hope, In Christ alone.”"},"url":{"en-US":"not-about-me"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/not-about-me/"}}},

I tried to do what was right, not to please God but because, “that’s what my mama told me to do.” Going to church in Abilene, Texas, I learned the three big wrongs: Don’t have sex, don’t cuss, and don’t disrespect your elders. I had those down, but I had a terrible habit of stealing. It didn’t violate “the big wrongs,” and it didn’t hurt my mom. In fact, I figured I was even helping my mom out with my stealing habit. I didn’t have to bother her with things she couldn’t afford to buy for me.  \n  \n  \n  \nAfter my dad died, life became unstable. We moved to a different apartment every year, and I never had a steady group of friends. To make matters worse, my mom re-married a white man, our house got broken into, and we had to move to Dallas.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Life Change**  \nI was 13 then, and I struggled with my identity. Culturally, I had to figure out whether I was going to be “black” or “white,” good or bad. I attended a youth revival, and the pastor preached about a God who had this standard that I didn’t meet, but still loved me and sent His son to die for me and cover my sin. If I believed in Him, He would forgive me of all my sins and I would have eternal life. My eyes were opened, and I realized it wasn’t about keeping my mama’s standard or being a “good girl.” I asked God to take control of my life.  \n  \n   \n  \nI wanted to change, but I didn’t know exactly how to stop my stealing habit. I made a pact with God. I told him, “I don’t know how to stop, but if You want me to stop then I’ll get caught and I’ll stop.” In a short time, I was caught and arrested. It may have been silly for me to make a pact with God, but in that I can see how God answers even the smallest, sincere prayers.  \n  \n   \n  \n**Cheated On**  \n  \nI began to strive after the Lord, but I was still focused on following what I thought were the rules. Keep the 10 commandments, don’t have sex, and make sure you wear a skirt or dress to church. This continued into college and stirred a lot of frustration within me. I saw people who professed Christianity but did whatever they wanted, and I didn’t understand why I had all these restrictions. So, I chose to rebel. I did whatever I wanted. I partied and got into a relationship with the wrong guy. When that guy cheated on me, I experienced true brokenness.  \n  \n   \n  \nI worked at a Kanakuk Kamp (KAA) that summer, and I remember listening intently to the pastor and him looking and pointing directly at me and saying, “You are the Bride of Righteousness” ([Isaiah 61:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2061:10&version=NIV)). I broke down. I realized I had turned away from God and had not fully trusted Him with my life. Yet, He somehow still considered me the Bride of Righteousness. His promise in [Jeremiah 29:11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jeremiah%2029:11&version=NIV) to give me hope and a future still applied to me. I was hurt because I had been cheated on, when I was the one who truly cheated on God. I left Him for something less than what he had planned for me. And even after that His arms were still wide open for me. I realize this was him disciplining His child ([Hebrews 12:6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews%2012:6&version=NIV)).  \n  \n   \n  \n**My Own Good**  \nI always thought you saw people at church on Sunday and never spoke to them again until the following Sunday. Through Kamp and the college ministry at SFA I began to meet true believers—believers who lived by His standards, not because they were “rules,” but because they realized how great the Lord was and wanted to be His. They helped me learn that my true identity was not external, but in Christ as a child of God ([Galatians 3:28](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians%203:28&version=NIV)). They weren’t entangled by man-made traditions that gave an appearance of holiness ([Colossians 2:23](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:23&version=NIV)). I saw the freedom they had and wanted it, too.  \n  \n  \n  \nRules without relationship equals rebellion. Even though I trusted the Lord early in life, I didn’t understand _why_ I did the things I did. But now I obey because His love and grace spurs me on, and I realize all He says is for my own good and protection. He knows better than I do. Every day I must choose to trust His will over mine."},"url":{"en-US":"rules-vs-relationship"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/rules-vs-relationship/"}}},

I grew up in a Christian home where going to church on Sundays was the normal routine, but I also didn’t really feel like I fit in there either. Feeling completely isolated and like an outsider, I began looking for answers elsewhere. Eventually I discovered pornography, which began its slow, strangling grip on my life.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor two years I shut myself off from everyone around me, hoping to find happiness, but never felt a deep sense of satisfaction in it. I looked up to my older sister, who seemed to possess all the things I wished I wanted—friends, looks, intelligence. I noticed that even though she had all of these things, they weren’t her top priorities. What made an impact on me was that above all else, she seemed to enjoy her time at church.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Bridge**  \n  \nAround the time I was 16 someone introduced me to a book called _Power for Living_. The book explained the “Bridge Illustration” about how our sins separate us from God. I learned from Romans 6:23 that “the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” I was destined to worse than a miserable life!  \n  \n   \n  \nIn my heart I knew I had never made the decision to follow Christ, and the book walked me through the truth of Romans 10:9-10,  \n  \n  \n  \n_If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved._  \n  \n   \n  \nI finally decided to trust in this truth and declare that Jesus is Lord.  \n  \n   \n  \n**Addiction and Recovery**  \nFrom then on I felt a deep sense of hope in my life, but that didn’t mean that things were easy. Unfortunately, because I wasn’t in a church that was strongly biblically based at the time, I still struggled with pornography and with finding my place throughout high school. Finally, in college, my porn problem became an all-out addiction and I failed out of school, twice.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod placed on my heart the need to come clean about my struggle with those who loved me. After confessing to my parents, we decided it was in my best interest to leave college for a year and get help.  \n  \n  \n  \nI attended Celebrate Recovery and saw a counselor while I missed my senior year at A&M. True to the scripture in 1 John 1:9, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness,” God forgave me of my sin and I began the healing process.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Change through Community**  \n  \nAfterwards, I was able to earn my degree from A&M. However, because I was turned off from church due to past experiences, I attempted to go solo on my walk with God for many years. I never made very much progress with God on my own, and there was still a small sense of legalism in everything I was doing, even though I knew my deeds weren’t what God was looking for.  \n  \n  \n  \nThings changed after I got involved at Watermark last year. I began growing in my walk due to being part of a great [community group](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/) of guys who have challenged me in my daily fight against sin, and have encouraged me to make Christ ultimate in my life. I am becoming more comfortable around my peers, more bold in sharing my faith, and more confident in God’s immense love for me. I look forward to being able to share His love with others, and to encourage others who have [struggled with pornography addiction](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-overcome-a-pornography-addiction/) and other hang-ups that God’s love is your only answer."},"url":{"en-US":"from-hopelessness-to-healing"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/from-hopelessness-to-healing/"}}},

I feel the need to point that out because last week I told a story of her misbehaving when talking about [hell and lollipops](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-is-hell/). As a counterpoint to that, this week I’m going to talk about heaven…and lollipops. Again the best illustration I have involves Presley misbehaving, even though that’s relatively rare. But, hey, [Romans 3:23](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen Presley was about 4, she was playing with building blocks with her younger sister, Finley, who kept knocking down whatever Presley was building. In a moment of anger, Presley took one of the blocks and smacked her sister over the head with it.  \n  \n  \n  \nFinley started crying hysterically, and Presley, immediately realizing what she had done, also started crying, both because of the pain she had caused her sister and because of fear of the consequences. I have to tend to Finley first, so I tell Presley to go to her room—which she knows means to go to this chair in her room, where she sits and waits for the wrath of Daddy. Presley’s just sitting there, weeping, and saying “I’m sorry Daddy, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”  \n  \n  \n  \nAs many people have noted, children don’t come with an instruction manual. Actually, there is one—it’s called the Bible—but I’m not always perfect in how I apply it. I’m trying to figure out how to handle this, and praying for God to give me something to say. So I go into the other room and grab a lollipop. Not a little sucker or blow pop, but a giant, big-as-your-face lollipop. The kind that lasts you all year. Presley loves lollipops more than just about anything else in the world, so this is (in her mind) pretty much the greatest gift I could possibly give her. And that’s what I do. I walk in her room and hand it to her.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou’ve never seen someone so confused. She’s crying and smiling at the same time, and looking at me and the lollipop like, what do I do with this? Is it a trick? Is he going to use it as a paddle to spank me? Is it poisoned, or something?  \n  \n  \n  \nI tell her, “It’s yours. Enjoy it.”  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd she says, “Why, Daddy?”  \n  \n  \n  \n“Presley, enjoy it. It’s yours.”  \n  \n  \n  \n“But Daddy, _why?_”  \n  \n  \n  \n“Presley, this is grace. This is grace. You deserve the spanking of a lifetime. I am _so_ disappointed in the choice you just made. But this is what God has done for your Daddy. See, Daddy deserves the ‘supernatural spanking’ of a lifetime. But God has shown me grace. He has absorbed that spanking Himself, and He has given me abundant life in place of it. So enjoy your giant lollipop. That’s grace.”  \n  \n  \n  \nAs [Jefferson Bethke pointed out last week at The Porch](http://www.watermark.org/media/jesus-religion/2762/), most of us try to earn God’s favor. Like the Prodigal Son, we think that if we feel badly enough about what we have done and say “I’m sorry” enough, that God might begrudgingly tolerate us. Or, like the older son in that parable, perhaps we try to always do good works and never, ever do anything wrong (which is impossible, even for an “innocent” child). In the process, we miss out on the fact that God is freely offering us grace, with no strings attached.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is hard for us to grasp because that type of exchange—eternal riches for nothing, other than our misdeeds—does not make sense. It’s just not natural. It’s supernatural.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou get heaven and avoid hell because God is good, not because you are.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s grace.  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/20534270\" height=\"371\" width=\"660\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"grace-like-a-lollipop"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/grace-like-a-lollipop/"}}},

Better yet, how is this even possible?  \n  \n  \n  \nAfter all, the same age group supposedly averages 328 “friends” on Facebook (honestly, I expected that number to be even higher). Everybody in the world can see exactly what you had for breakfast; that’s pretty personal, right?  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd it’s not like Generation Y is composed of a lot of farmers or shepherds who rarely see another human. We live in giant cities, in apartment complexes, and work in office cubicles where the walls between us are only four feet tall. Forget lonely; it seems like we’d have to work really hard to even be alone.  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, our extreme connectedness is part of the reason we lack true connections. You can’t have 328 close friends. It’s impossible. There aren’t enough hours in the day. And in small towns, such as where I grew up, people are more likely to be involved in each other’s lives. It would seem ridiculous in Cuero for someone not to know their next-door neighbor, but in cities like Dallas that is very common.  \n  \n  \n  \nAdd in the fact that [statistically Generation Y](http://theporch.wpengine.com/generation-why-statistics/) tends to be rather self-centered and afraid of commitment, and you have a group that tends to find itself alone in a crowd.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why It Matters**  \n  \n_The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone.” – Genesis 2:18b_   \n  \n  \n  \nLoneliness was the first thing in all creation that God saw was “not good.” Seven times in Genesis 1 you have some variation of “And God saw that it was good,” so having Him say that something was “_not_ good” is kind of jarring.  \n  \n  \n  \nHumans are created to live in relationship with each other. Even people who don’t believe in creation would almost universally agree with the rest of that statement. That’s why people who are already in prison dread the punishment of solitary confinement. It is also why this loneliest generation is statistically also the most depressed, and why we can tend to make some _really_ questionable decisions when we make those decisions alone.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf nobody truly knows you—knows how you are feeling, what you are facing, and what is going on in your life—then that is truly not good.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Leaving Lonely**  \n  \nThat is why [we talk about community all the time](http://theporch.wpengine.com/tag/community/).

(I don’t know why, but it seems we always think that by going to Africa for a week/month/year we are somehow going to change the world.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**Find Your Mission**  \n  \nSo, when Watermark offered a class called “Find Your Mission,” I planned to go and try to sign up for a trip. But as God would have it, they cancelled the class and I ended up taking “Sharing Your Faith with Authenticity” instead. In that class, we read a book about evangelism called _The One Thing You Can’t Do in Heaven_. I quickly realized that I had never shared the gospel, never memorized Scripture, and never told people why my life was different: JESUS.  \n  \n  \n  \nIronically, taking the wrong class helped me to find my mission: always share your faith. My life changed a lot in the coming months, and I started being “on mission” here in Dallas. I began to live out my faith and share with friends, family, co-workers, and strangers. Sometimes I felt awkward, sometimes I felt overwhelmed, and I realized that sometimes I was not being very clear.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, as I looked for opportunities to be trained to become a better disciple-maker here in Dallas, I was pointed towards a young adult trip to Ethiopia. I went to an informational meeting where I thought we were going to pay some money and go on a trip in a month or two. I was ready!!!!!!  \n  \n  \n  \nBut it didn't work how I thought. They wanted us to raise the money (so we could learn all of the things I was talking about—how to share with family, friends, co-workers, etc.). Also, they wanted to make sure that we got the most out of the trip, so we had 20+ training sessions over a 9 month period. WOW. That was a big ask, and didn't sound quite as exciting as the quick change-the-world trip I had envisioned.  \n  \n  \n  \nI ended up going to Africa and Haiti last year. I could write lots of blog posts from my experiences. But Africa didn't change me, and I didn't change Africa. God used the training to change me, and God used me to make a small difference in Africa.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What’s Your Mission?**  \n  \nAs Christians, I thought it was our job to go to Africa. But really, it’s our job to share the love of Christ with people we see every day—whether we’re in Dallas or halfway around the world.  \n  \n  \n  \nChrist did give us a directive to spread His good news everywhere ([Matthew 28:18-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:18-20&version=NIV); [Acts 1:8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%201:8&version=NIV)), and the quality of the training and trips from Watermark have helped me to take part in that mission.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are interested in learning more about taking part in an overseas discipleship trip, there are a few opportunities to do so over the next year. Watermark partners with Mission of Hope in Haiti and E3 Ministries in Ethiopia to regularly train and send people out to these areas of great need.

At the time, I’m not sure I fully understood His love for us, but I understood the essentials of Christ’s sacrifice for our sins on the cross. That understanding grew as I remained involved in the church throughout high school; however, there have been many highs and lows as I matured in my faith.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Falling Out**  \n  \nDuring my freshman year of college, I had a falling out from my relationship with the Lord, and turned my back on Him. The freedom from my Christian home and friends left me with no accountability, and I began to take part in the party scene, including drinking heavily and smoking marijuana. The turning point was during the spring semester of my sophomore year, when I went to jail for trying to order drinks at a bar using a fake ID. I felt very alone and ashamed. I couldn’t stop thinking about the fact that I had gone to jail, and felt like I had lost my identity.  \n  \n  \n  \nLooking back now, I am thankful for that time in jail, because it helped shape my life and prevented me from continuing on a bad path. It forced me to reevaluate my life and turn towards God for guidance.  \n  \n  \n  \nI joined a college Bible study the next semester at my church in College Station, TX. It helped slowly turn my life back towards a meaningful relationship with Christ. While it wasn’t a complete 180 degree turn, God was working in my life. He never allowed me to stray too far and fought for me to come back to Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n**A Continuing Presence**  \n  \nOnce I graduated from Texas A&M two years ago, God continued His presence and placed a desire in my heart to develop meaningful relationships with other Christians. I was involved in a small Bible study through Northwest Bible Church in Dallas. Although the Bible study was short-lived, it showed me the potential of having these types of Christ-centered relationships. I then started attending Watermark Community Church in Dallas and got [plugged into a community group](http://theporch.wpengine.com/plugging-in-six-ways-to-get-connected-in-community/) a year ago.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod has done a lot of work in my life throughout my time in Dallas, and that has helped me understand that He does have a purpose for your life; things do not just happen because of circumstance. I find a lot of comfort in knowing that everything has been set forth for us since the beginning.  \n  \n  \n  \nWatermark has really helped me understand God’s grace and love. Although I still sin and struggle, I’m able to be held accountable through community, which has helped strengthen my faith.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod has placed a desire in everyone’s hearts for a relationship with Him, and it is only through this relationship that we may feel complete in our lives.  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

Let me be clear, I am not opposed to Halloween, dressing up, or trick-or-treating. My children will partake in those activities. Recently my 4-year-old asked me if ghosts are real. I replied, “no, ghosts are not real,” because they are not, but I couldn't help thinking “but there are demons.”  \n  \n  \n  \nDemons are real. They are created beings that follow Satan instead of God. They were in heaven as angels and when Satan fell, a third of the angels ([Revelation 12:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%2012:4&version=NIV)) went with him instead of remaining in the presence and goodness of God. You can read about Satan's fall in [Revelation 12:9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation%2012:4&version=NIV), and symbolically in [Isaiah 14:12-15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah%2014:12-15&version=NIV) and [Ezekiel 28:12-17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2028:12-17&version=NIV). The sin of these angels was that they abused their authority and used it to satisfy evil desires ([Jude 1:6-7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201:6-7&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \n**What Demons Do**  \n  \nUnderstanding the fall of demons helps us understand their purpose. Angels worship God and help His people while Satan and demons oppose God, lie about His character, and attempt to deceive those who love Him ([2 Corinthians 4:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:4&version=NIV), [2 Corinthians 11:14-15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2011:14-15&version=NIV)). Demons attack Christians ([1 Peter 5:8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20peter%205:8&version=NIV), [2 Corinthians 12:7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2012:7&version=NIV)) and are at war with God's holy angels ([Revelation 12:7-8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012:7-8&version=NIV)). They are spiritual beings who have the ability to take on physical form, and they can possess people ([Luke 4:33-35](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%204:33-35&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \nWe have no reason to believe that Satan is omnipresent (everywhere at one time) or omniscient (all-knowing), so, much of his work is most likely done by his army of fallen angels. These demons have power, and it would be very foolish to make light of them by entertaining evil thoughts, ideas, and activities ([Acts 19:13-16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019:13-16&version=NIV), [2 Peter 2:10-12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%202:10-12&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \n**Defeating Demons**  \n  \nHowever, it is equally foolish to make too much of them by seeing them everywhere and in everything. Satan and his army battle from a position of defeat. They are no match for the omnipotence of God ([Luke 8:26-33](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:26-33&version=NIV)), and the power we receive from his Spirit ([1 John 4:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:4&version=NIV)). Satan's goal is to get us to disobey God, so our victory is the obedience we walk in when we are in right relationship with Jesus ([Ephesians 2:1-2](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:1-2&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat should you do if you feel you are being threatened by demonic powers? The same things you should do in your pursuit of God. Start by reminding yourself of the wonderful act of the gospel: that God gave His Son Jesus as a payment for your sins so that you are His forever. Remind yourself of the promises of God and His goodness by studying His Word, the Bible. Pray and ask the Lord to help you walk in obedience to Him, and consistently [surround yourself with people who love God](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/) and are committed to living according to His Word.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat questions do you have about demons or Halloween?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"halloween-and-demons"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/halloween-and-demons/"}}},

Although this was a huge blessing for my family in many different ways, it was a negative in many ways as well.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Never Measuring Up**  \nIn many Asian cultures, love is shown primarily through actions instead of through words and physical affection. My grandmother cared for us by cooking, cleaning, taking us to school, and helping us with anything we needed, but she would also pierce us with her words on a daily basis. Of everything she said, there was one exclamation that haunted me most: _“If you can do this correctly, I’ll give you my head!”_ (literal translation from Taiwanese). As in, “I will swear on my own head that you will never be able to do [insert task here] correctly.” These negative remarks, compounded with the unspoken expectations to follow in my sister’s and cousins’ beyond sterling academic (think Harvard, Stanford, and Berkeley) and extracurricular records, made me believe that I was unworthy of affection and lacking in value.  \n  \n  \n  \nBecause of this, my childhood became one big game of “grow up.” I tried to excel at everything and almost never had time to just be a child—when other children were at summer camp, I was working hard at math camp or Chinese school (stereotypical, I know).  \n  \n  \n  \nThis mentality was carried into many aspects of my life, including church. I grew up in a Christian family, but always felt that just like with my family, I had to earn God’s affection. I believed that I needed to be the flawless Christian, to know my Bible inside and out, and to be a good role model for people around me. I mean, why would God want to love me if I were anything less than the perfect “Christian?”  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Other Son**  \nDuring the summer just before high school, Christ broke through to me and gave me a glimpse of the meaning of grace. That summer, I heard a pastor speak at a conference about identity. What impacted me the most was the pastor’s [message on the parable of the lost son](http://www.watermark.org/media/jesus-religion/2762/)—not the son we usually think about, but the second lost son. This older son said to his father, “Look! These many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends” (Luke 15:29). To this, the father replied, “Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours’” (Luke 15:31). What a beautiful picture of what we have in Christ: everything. Not because we’ve earned a single thing through our own power, but because through God’s undeserved love, mercy, and grace for us, we have been made children of God and co-heirs with Christ ([Romans 8:14-17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%208:14-17&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \n**Constant Reminders**  \nDon’t get me wrong; my perfectionist tendencies are still alive and kicking, and it still seems like God smacks me over the head at least once a year and says, “Why are you still trying to earn my love?” But through my relationship with my Savior I’ve gained two very important things: truth and freedom. Truth that my identity is in the fact that I belong to God, and that my worth does not lie in my own skill, knowledge, or merit. Freedom that I do not have to work for God’s affection, but now love to join in His work in the world because of His unconditional love for me.  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

Needless to say, it’s been a week of many tears. It’s just really, really, really, really sad.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs I shared the news with the Porch volunteers, the one verse that came to mind was John 11:35: “Jesus wept.” It is somewhat famous for being the shortest verse in the Bible, and therefore the easiest to memorize. But it also carries a lot of weight when you stop to consider _why_ Jesus wept.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Rest of the Story**  \n  \nThe larger story surrounding that two-word verse is fascinating. Really, go [read John 11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nJesus was away, in a different part of the country, when someone delivers a message from His friends Mary and Martha that their brother Lazarus was very ill. Now, Jesus was well-known by this time as the greatest doctor in history, and it’s not even close. He regularly and instantaneously cured incurable diseases—diseases that are still incurable today—and could do so [without even seeing the patient](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%208:5-13&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nSo what does Jesus do when He hears that His friend Lazarus is sick? Nothing, really. He stays where He is for two more days. He does comment that “This sickness will not end in death,” which is really interesting when you do the math and realize that Lazarus was probably _already dead_ by the time Jesus got the message, and that [Jesus knew this](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2011:14&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nAfter two days, Jesus tells the disciples that they are going to go visit Lazarus to, and I quote, “wake him up.” From death. Because it really is that simple for Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Don’t You Care?**  \n  \nWhen He arrives, and Lazarus has been dead for at least four days, Martha and Mary each separately confront Jesus and say essentially the same thing: “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”  \n  \n  \n  \nIt doesn’t appear that they were accusing Him, but it would be easy to imagine such a scenario. _Where were You, Lord? We called for You! You had the power to save him, but You didn’t. Don’t You care?_  \n  \n   \n  \nWe get a clear answer to that last unasked question soon after: “Jesus wept.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**Supernatural Sadness**  \n  \nBut why would Jesus be overcome with sadness? Consider the facts:\n\n  \n- Jesus was on His way to “wake him up.” He knew that, literally within a few minutes, Lazarus would be completely _not dead_. He would be as good as new.\n  \n- Likewise, He knew that the people who were crying around Him would very soon be overwhelmed with joy.\n  \n- He knew exactly how everything was going to turn out. He even said, more than once, that the entire chain of events was designed to serve a larger purpose: people would know He was the Son of God and believe that He had the power to give life to the dead.\n  \n  \nFor Jesus, who is God, to sincerely weep in this situation is humanly impossible. It was a supernatural occurrence; His tears were as miraculous as Lazarus’ resurrection. It would be like if my daughter Presley, not knowing how the TV worked, accidentally pressed the button to turn it off and then began to cry thinking she “broke the TV.” I wouldn’t cry with her. How could I?! I’d just turn the TV back on.  \n  \n  \n  \nYet Jesus truly felt sadness. Deep sadness. It says that He was “deeply moved in spirit and troubled” when He saw how sad and hurt Mary and the others were. He felt their pain, and was hurt that they hurt. And perhaps the bystanders were right when they saw Jesus weeping and said “See how he loved him!” Jesus did love Lazarus, as He loves everyone, and felt sadness that he had died—even though it was temporary.  \n  \n  \n  \n[God understands tragedy](http://theporch.wpengine.com/does-god-understand-tragedy/). When friends lose babies, or we lose friends, or anything causes our hearts to break, He is not indifferent. He cares more deeply than we do. And it seems He chooses to grieve with us even though He has a different perspective: He knows the purpose behind it all. He knows how it all will end, and that even death does not have to end in death.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Some Advice**  \n  \nWhen a friend experiences the sorrow of loss, resist the urge to say something profound. Remind them that you love them, and be sad with them. Resist saying, “Let me know if there is anything I can do.” Instead, just observe with the intention of finding something that you can do proactively.  \n  \n  \n  \nThough we grieve, we grieve from a position of hope.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope. For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. – 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14_  \n  \n   \n  \nWhat have friends done to encourage you in times of loss and heartache?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)"},"url":{"en-US":"why-jesus-wept"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-jesus-wept/"}}},

I would not say there is a moment that I did not know of the Lord, as I was surrounded by a church upbringing, but I would say that I did not necessarily know the Lord, or have a relationship with Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n**If/Then Belief**  \nIn junior high I viewed my faith through a performance-based lens. My faith was an if/then belief. “_If_ I do this, _then_ I will go to heaven. _If_ I do this, _then_ I will go to hell.” I was so focused on the threat of hell and the reward of heaven, that I didn’t have a relationship with the Lord.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn high school I was overly involved in my youth group—attending every trip, leading worship, attending Bible study. However, looking back, I couldn’t tell you exactly what I believed. I did have a faith, but my focus was more on doing than believing and trusting.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn college I plugged into a biblically-based church and drifted away from performance-based legalism to focusing on the life and character of Jesus. I attended a highly relationally-driven private Christian college and was a Resident Assistant for two years, which shifted my attention on how to love others well, as the Lord loves. I grew exponentially in my faith during this four-year period, but a struggle against control continued to surface.  \n  \n  \n  \n**When Idols Vaporize**  \nI have always [struggled with control and trusting myself rather than the Lord](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-is-in-control/). The Lord used one rough summer to teach me an irreplaceable lesson. The summer after my junior year of college, I moved to Dallas, where I hardly knew a soul, for an internship. The day before I came to Dallas I broke up with my boyfriend, the first serious relationship I had been in where I saw marriage on the horizon.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis relationship had been unhealthy for a slew of reasons, but the most prevalent and serious is that we were making each other our gods, our idols—instead of letting God be God in our lives. Our dependence was in each other, not the Lord.  \n  \n  \n  \nBeing in Dallas was a low point for me. I had no friends, no boyfriend, and no family nearby –all the things I had put my trust in and relied on in the past were out of reach for the first time.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Foundation is Trust**  \nThe Lord brought me to my knees at a point of total surrender, as my only option was to rely and trust in Him. I saw what a true trusting relationship in the Lord is supposed to look like. I was Spirit-filled by the Lord’s presence in my life, finding my hope and joy in my relationship with the Lord.  \n  \n  \n  \nAfter living in a deepened relationship with the Lord, with the kind of faith and trust that only comes from whole-heartedly depending on God for every little thing, I came to realize that being in a true relationship with the Lord goes hand in hand with trusting Him. I had been telling myself a lie that I could have a deep personal relationship with the Lord, but only trust Him some of the time–when it was easy and convenient for me.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Growing in Faith Daily**  \nThis season of my life showed me not only how harmful not trusting the Lord is to my relationship with Him, but also the truth that, “It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man” (Psalm 118:8) and to have confidence in Christ as our competence comes from the Lord, not ourselves ([2 Corinthians 3:4-5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:4-5&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \nI am still learning and growing in faith daily. And don’t get me wrong, trusting in the Lord is a daily battle. It is a continual temptation to depend on myself, others, or the things of this world. But it is in these moments that I have to hold firm to the promise of Proverbs 3:5, “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**He Wants Your All**  \nMy own understanding tells me to trust myself. But my Lord and Savior, who loves me, wants me to surrender not just part of my life to Him, but my all—including the desire to control and to trust other things besides Him. It is through this complete surrender that the Lord does His best work and that I am in right relationship with Him."},"url":{"en-US":"my-control-is-out-of-control"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/my-control-is-out-of-control/"}}},

Growing up, I enjoyed learning about my heritage and religion, and I sought after God by praying the prayers and performing the religious acts that I had learned. I believed that I needed to serve God by performing mitzvoth (good deeds that come from knowing the commandments) and through that I would find salvation. I attended Hebrew school, was active in my synagogue, had a Bar Mitzvah, and even was an assistant religious school teacher.  \n  \n  \n  \nMost people who attempted to talk to me about Jesus didn't try twice. I had read about the Messiah, and was able to scare away most people who attempted to witness to me by challenging them in a few areas. They didn't know their Bibles well enough to question what I said.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Proving Them Wrong**  \n  \nOne day, someone challenged me to read the New Testament and prove to them that they were wrong about Jesus. I thought it would be pretty easy, and I remember opening up the New Testament and thinking how irrelevant all the funny named books in there were to my faith.  \n  \n  \n  \nI decided to start reading in the book of James and the first verse completely caught me off guard:  \n  \n  \n  \n_James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings. – James 1:1_  \n  \n  \n  \nI remember being shocked that James, a Jew, was writing to other Jews. I knew that Jesus was a Jew, but it hasn't occurred to me that His followers were as well. I finished James and jumped into the book of Matthew. Over a period of months I would look at prophecy in the Old Testament and come back to Jesus’ life as recorded in the Gospels. Each time I did I became a little more convinced that there was something to Jesus’ claims of being the Messiah. I prayed and asked God to show me the truth, whatever it was, so I could stop spending time thinking about it.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Old and New**  \n  \nSoon after that, things became clear to me.  \n  \n  \n  \nI came to see that Jesus was the fulfillment of prophecy after prophecy in the Old Testament and that He came to reconcile man to God in a way that was beautifully foretold. I accepted His Lordship and that His perfect life, death, and resurrection were the basis for my eternal forgiveness. I also learned that although righteousness through faith was a foreign concept to me, it wasn't a New Testament idea. I learned that Abraham was an early example of this in Genesis 15:6:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness._   \n  \n  \n  \nFor the first time in my life I had a faith that truly felt alive to me because of being in right relationship with God.  \n  \n  \n  \nI wish I could say that life has been easy since I made that decision, but it has not. I've faced persecution, hardship, heartbreak, and failure, just like everyone else. However, I found something I never had before. I have a real relationship with the living God and through every trial I get to know Him more. That alone is worth more than anything I've given up or lost in life.  \n  \n  \n  \nPaul wrote to the church in Philippi:  \n  \n  \n  \n_What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ… – Philippians 3:8_  \n  \n  \n  \nNow, instead of trying to work my way to God, I have the peace that comes from knowing that He worked His way to me and that the growth in my life comes from a satisfying, deeper relationship with Him, not from trying harder to fulfill a list of rules.  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

This feeling of anger, misunderstanding, helplessness, and loneliness began shortly after my parents got divorced. I began to distance myself from everyone in my life. I also had no desire to connect with new people or engage in conversation with family or friends. I became a quiet, non-confrontational young man.  \n  \n  \n  \nI focused all of my time on sports to get away from a tornado of emotion that I was suppressing every day. Sports controlled the way I acted, interacted, and even the way I talked.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Never Understood**  \n  \nEven though I was going to church and called myself a believer, I never truly understood what it meant to be saved. I wanted to know what it meant to be saved and wanted to know God’s love for me. But I never had someone in my life who showed me what it meant. I started looking for other ways to feel satisfied in the world rather than looking to Christ. Inappropriate relationships, sports, and work became the main focus in my life.  \n  \n  \n  \nEverything I did in the world only made me feel empty inside. I was lost and looking for anything to satisfy me.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What I Was Missing**  \n  \nI was miserable until a friend invited me to The Porch. It was in that evening that I understood what I was missing. That night something changed in me. I no longer wanted to live for the world. I couldn't explain it at first but as I began to get more involved in church I saw that God was working in my life. God was changing my heart and my mind.  \n  \n  \n  \nI no longer cared about the pleasures of the world; I wanted to live for Christ instead.  \n  \n  \n  \nI still have a long journey in front of me. I am a work in progress, but it feels amazing to be living for Christ. I now know that God loves me so much that He sent His son to die for me. That there is nothing I can do to get into heaven. Jesus did it all for me. He died for my sins and said it is done. Nothing can separate me from God’s love.  \n  \n  \n  \n_For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God. – John 3:16-21_"},"url":{"en-US":"satisfied"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/satisfied/"}}},

I managed to keep these things somewhat under control during my school years, and eventually graduated college with an engineering degree. I moved to a new city alone and with no one to hold me accountable for my actions, I used my newly found finances to frequent the bars, clubs, and casinos.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe years after graduation were a death spiral of bad decisions through which I became destructively addicted to alcohol, sex, and gambling. I became an expert manipulator and despite my addictions, most people would tell you I was a pretty good guy who kept it all together. In reality, I was completely isolated and found myself at the depths of hell, feeling an extreme amount of self-hatred and guilt for all of my horrible decisions.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Lost It All**  \n  \nI hit bottom while visiting my parents when they witnessed my complete drunkenness and immorality firsthand. No longer able to hide the fact that I had become disgusting and completely selfish, I became buried under a deep depression and for the first time, my work performance suffered. All aspects of my life had unraveled, and in a last ditch effort, I rounded up every last dollar I could find and went to the casino in complete desperation. By God’s grace, I lost it all.  \n  \n  \n  \n**End It All**  \n  \nThe next morning, I waited until my girlfriend left for work and then took my grandfather’s antique pistol and locked myself in the bathroom. I sat in the tub in the dark and closed the shower curtain. I put the barrel in my mouth, tasting the cold steel, and cocked the hammer back. I put my finger on the trigger and before I pulled it, I decided to pray for the first time in a very long time. It was the first unselfish prayer I had said in many years. I apologized to God for what I’d become and what I was about to do. I asked him to take care of my family, friends, and girlfriend during the time after my death. Then I closed my eyes and just before I squeezed off a round, my apartment door opened and my girlfriend came in yelling for me. Just seconds after finally talking to God, He came to my rescue. She would later tell me that just after getting to work she had a horrible feeling and decided to come back and check on me.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’d like to say that after this clear intervention from God, I was immediately a changed man, but unfortunately, that was not the case. For years, I simply tried to manage and control my addictions, which only resulted in repeated failures and bouts of depression.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Surrender It All**  \n  \nThrough all of this utter rebellion, God, in his incredible grace, eventually provided me a great new job opportunity in Dallas. A friend there invited me to a church. There God reminded me that we are all sinners, but that Jesus accepted the death penalty for our sins by laying down His life on the cross, and then defeated sin when He was raised from the dead. I learned that if we believe this, He freely offers us forgiveness and eternal life, and that there is nothing we can do to make Him love us any more or any less.  \n  \n  \n  \nHe finally brought me to admit that I was powerless over my addictions, and I fully surrendered them to Christ. By the power of the Holy Spirit, the addictions that I’d been a slave to for over a decade began to fall away with amazing speed. I now live a life of full devotion to Christ in which I have sexual purity and no longer drink or gamble. While I am still faced with the same temptations, God has provided me a way out and I have come to find peace knowing that He is good and is in control of my life.  \n  \n  \n  \nI now live in joy knowing that Christ has healed and cleansed me. My entire life, I didn’t know that God was all I needed until God was all that I had. Psalm 50:15 says “and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me.” When I should have tasted a bullet, God allowed me to taste His incredible grace and love. He delivered me from the depths of hell and I will love and honor Him for eternity.  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

It was an excellent experience that stretched us beyond our comfort zones.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn Haiti, we would go in groups to different villages to share the gospel. We did this through an interpreter, who was shared between several individuals. Having to share an interpreter could be a frustrating experience: you have to speak with long pauses while they translate, and 5 or 6 of your peers watch you because they can’t be doing much else.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn one particular village, with one particular translator who I knew was a Christian, I just said “tell them.” “You know the gospel; I don’t need to tell it to you in English so that you can repeat it in their language. Just tell them.” Later that night, as we debriefed the day, I realized what I was asking. These were his neighbors and he was going door to door sharing the gospel. We were his “excuse” for the conversation, and so I was just asking him to “tell them.” However, I don’t do that myself with my neighbors in Dallas. I’ll confess, I’ve never just gone door to door down my street armed only with the Good News.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why Not?**  \n  \nThis past weekend a couple, now married, who were in Haiti with me, said they would do just that. They prayed about it and asked friends to join them for a two-day in-town mission trip, dubbed “Unashamed.” 72 showed up, which is ironic if you know your Bible ([see Luke 10:1-2](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:1-2&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat happened next was incredible. Some of the stories they later shared with me:\n\n  \n- Many of the 72 had never shared their faith with anyone before two weeks ago, but they went all over Uptown doing exactly that with their peers. One of the girls on our team said, “Walking down the streets past the bars I used to bartend at, I know these streets, but this was the first time I was sharing my faith here.”\n  \n- In South Dallas, several team members shared the gospel with one girl, who responded, “It is normally someone trying to turn a trick, or a drug dealer approaching me. This time it was you telling me God loves me. Your story has helped to set me free.”\n  \n- A Jewish gang leader who had just gotten out of prison accepted Christ.\n  \n- In West Dallas, while serving with [2ndSaturday](http://www.2ndsaturday.org/), a girl on the team got to lead a little boy to Christ while he held the hand of one of the guys.\n  \n- We also had a scavenger hunt that included acts of kindness to help our crew engage with others, including carrying groceries, pumping gas, and picking up people's dog's poop. Hilarious and amazing stories of hope and life change came from this, even from a guy named French Fry!\n  \n- At 10 p.m. on a Saturday night, when most of us used to be out drinking beers, hundreds of young adults were gathered in Klyde Warren Park to worship our great God. We thought we were going to get kicked out of the park before it even started, since Bud Light was scheduled to have a massive scavenger hunt and promo party for Justin Timberlake. However, less than 10 people showed up for that event, and they shut it down an hour early.\n  \n  \nPlus hundreds of other stories.  \n  \n  \n  \n**On Mission**  \n  \nWhen I take groups overseas on short-term discipleship trips, two things always happen.  \n\n  \n1. We have an AMAZING time.\n  \n2. People return frustrated, wishing that they knew the language and understood the culture.\n  \n  \nThey raised thousands of dollars to go there to share the gospel, only to return with the frustration of wishing they spoke the language and understood the culture. Don’t you see the irony?  \n  \n  \n  \nLook around you. Engage with your next-door neighbor. Stare a lost coworker in the eyes. You know the language and you understand the culture, so tell them the Good News of God’s grace.  \n  \n  \n  \n_For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. – Romans 1:16_  \n  \n  \n  \nDo you have a story of being \"unashamed\"?

I always wonder whether such people are sick, or trying to prevent getting sick. It seems like an extreme precautionary measure to take.  \n  \n  \n  \nNow, picture this. 10 guys are really sick. They are not just wearing little surgical masks; they have to shout “UNLCEAN” everywhere they go. They have to live outside the city, and everyone is scared to associate with them.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis was the reality for 10 particular lepers in a historical account documented in [Luke 17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+17). When they see Jesus they beg for pity from a distance, afraid to get close to anyone. Jesus tells them to go show themselves to the priest, which is what people with leprosy were supposed to do if they were healed from the disease in order to be reinstated into the community and be “clean” ([Leviticus 13:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus%2013:17&version=NIV)). They do so, and as you might expect from Jesus, all were healed.  \n  \n   \n  \nHere’s where it gets interesting and instructive. One of the 10 comes back and thanks Jesus. I’m sure they were all grateful, but only one returned to Jesus. Why?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Got What They Came For**  \n  \nFirst of all, because the other nine already got what they wanted from Jesus. They were sick, they wanted to be healed, and He healed them. The end. “Thank you Jesus.”  \n  \n  \n  \nThese guys thought too small. Their ask was so tiny: “Make me feel better, Jesus.” They didn’t realize all that Jesus could offer them. He didn’t come to heal the sick; He came to put an end to death.  \n  \n  \n  \n**All The World Could Offer**  \n  \nSecondly, they were too busy looking towards what was next to look backwards and give real thanks. They wanted to be back in the very society that had rejected them. This was their chance to get into the party that they had not been invited to for so long. These guys didn’t want to go back to Jesus; they wanted to get all that the world could offer them, and all that they had been denied while they were in the wilderness.  \n  \n  \n  \nI get it. There have been things I prayed for a long time for: a great wife, a good job, a fruitful ministry, great volunteers, healthy kids, etc. When Jesus answers those prayers, I tend to move on to the next. I don’t fall on my face before Him like the one. Most days, I am one of the nine ungrateful lepers.  \n  \n  \n  \n**More Than They Could Dream Of**  \n  \nThe tenth leper came back loudly praising God, and Jesus said that his faith had made him well ([Luke 17:15-19](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2017:15-19&version=NIV)). I believe that the tenth leper got what the other nine did not, and what probably nine out of ten people today don’t get. It wasn’t about temporary healing (for this life only); it was about finding the One who had the power over life and death. While the other nine were enjoying (somewhat) their new (temporary) life of (limited) health, he sought out the One who offers life forever in paradise.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe think so small when it comes to Jesus. We ask Him for [marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-we-get-married/) instead of a heart that desires a healthy relationship with someone who loves Him dearly and who will cherish us. We ask Him [for a job](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-to-do-if-you-hate-your-job/), instead of the ability to honor Him with the way we [steward every dollar He entrusts to us](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-stewardship-challenge/). We ask for things instead of asking for Him, because we don’t fully know what we’re missing. We don’t understand what He has done for us and what He can do for us.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis Thanksgiving I’d encourage you to reflect on all that Jesus has done for you. Spend extended time thanking Jesus. If you don’t know why you should thank Him, [let’s talk](mailto:theporch@watermark.org?subject=The%20Tenth%20Leper).  \n  \n  \n  \n[What are you thankful for?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/thankful/)  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"thanksgiving-and-the-tenth-leper"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/thanksgiving-and-the-tenth-leper/"}}},

That seems, especially in our culture, to be a rather counter-cultural idea, and maybe even something that you have to take on faith.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived, [knew what he was talking about](http://theporch.wpengine.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-will-leave-you-depressed/). And though [our own hearts may deceive us](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+17%3A9&version=NIV) and make it hard for us to believe it, all of the evidence agrees with Solomon.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat includes modern scientific research, as a friend pointed out. Some examples of recent research findings related to happiness:\n\n  \n- **Being rich won’t make you happier.** Being poor won’t make you happier, either, but past a certain income (which falls somewhere in the middle class) [more money does not result in more happiness](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html). What this means is that someone with a household income of $75,000 is just as happy on any given day as someone who makes $1 million a year. Of course, uber-rich Solomon knew this firsthand ([Ecclesiastes 5:10-13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%205:10-13&version=NIV)).\n  \n- **Having more stuff won’t make you happier.** We live in a consumer society, but it’s been shown repeatedly that consumption doesn’t make you happy. For example, [one study](http://dunn.psych.ubc.ca/files/2010/12/Spending-Money-on-Others-Promotes-Happiness.pdf) followed people who received a large bonus (about $5,000) and found that spending the money on themselves had no impact on happiness. (Spending money on others, or giving it to charity, did make them happier.) Solomon, who could afford anything and denied himself nothing his heart desired ([Ecclesiastes 2:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%202:10&version=NIV)), found no lasting joy or meaning in any of it.\n  \n- **Being married won’t make you happier.** At least not long-term. I know most people at The Porch are single, and most really wish they weren’t. But many who are married wish they were still single. [Researchers have found](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/opinion/sunday/new-love-a-short-shelf-life.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&) that marriage does tend to make you happy for a year or two, but after that married people are no happier than the unmarried. For me, the honeymoon period lasted only one year, and after that I was miserable in marriage (by God’s grace and some hard work, it’s gotten much better). Don’t think marriage is a cure-all; it’s kind of the opposite. Solomon had 700 wives, and then wrote Ecclesiastes.\n  \n  \nYou could continue that list with almost anything—I’ll finally be happy when I get _x_ worldly thing—and be wrong pretty much every time. That’s because of a principle called hedonic adaptation, or the [hedonic treadmill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill): the tendency we all have to quickly get used to any new thing and still be left wanting more. It’s why that new job that we’ve wanted for so long soon becomes that old job that we hate, and why that awesome $600 smartphone becomes lame once a new model comes out.  \n  \n  \n  \nReally, we know all this to be true. However, it is like being in love with someone who we know is no good for us: we are tempted to pursue it anyways.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo what are you supposed to do? Well, [watch or listen to this](http://www.watermark.org/media/enjoy-your-life/2821/), and then [come to The Porch tomorrow](http://theporch.wpengine.com) (12/03/13) to hear the conclusion of the Ecclesiastes series.  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)"},"url":{"en-US":"the-science-of-solomon"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-science-of-solomon/"}}},

We take this one break each year to allow everyone to celebrate Christmas, and to give our team of staff and volunteers a chance to recharge and plan for the next year.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe do know that gives you about six weeks of no Porch, and that might disappoint some folks. But I would encourage you to use this time, and your free Tuesday nights, to recharge and grow yourself.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow? There are a lot of possibilities, but here are seven things you can do to make good use of your Christmas break.  \n  \n\n\n  \n1. **Pray every day.** The most important thing we can do year-round is to pray. Pray for The Porch ministry to have an eternal impact. Pray for the young adults in Dallas, and everywhere, to accept the gospel and experience the fullness of life that comes from trusting in Christ. And pray that we, as fallible humans, would not get in the way of the message.\n  \n2. **Rest.** [God designed us to have periods of rest](http://www.watermark.org/media/sabbath-rest/2149/), and this is one extended opportunity to do so. This applies to everyone, but I would especially like to emphasize this for our volunteer team: 200+ people who commit to coming early and staying late _every_ Tuesday, as well as following up with people, counseling and discipling their peers, planning events, managing our online ministry, and basically making The Porch happen. They do it all on top of their own jobs, for a grand total of zero pay. Resist the temptation to not take some time off this Christmas season.\n  \n3. **Be on mission.** It is not about going to church on a Tuesday; it is about [being on mission with your life](http://theporch.wpengine.com/on-mission/), wherever you may be. So share the gospel. Tell people [what Christmas is all about](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKk9rv2hUfA). Look for opportunities to be generous or care for those who are less fortunate.\n  \n4. **Focus on Jesus.** Spend time working on your relationship with Him. Being on mission really comes out of an overflow of Him in your life. Plus, it’s His birthday we’re celebrating.\n  \n5. **Be in the Word.** This ties in heavily to the above. If you don’t know where to start studying the Bible, I’d suggest signing up for [Join the Journey](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/join-the-journey), a free daily email Bible study with devotionals written by other “Porchies” and Watermark members. A new Journey year starts on January 1; if you want something focused on Christmas before then, check out [Desiring God’s _Good News of Great Joy_](http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/books/good-news-of-great-joy), which is a free eBook devotional you can download (no sign-up required).\n  \n6. **Fellowship with loved ones.** Love on your family well. If you don’t have family or can’t be with them, you should still have a [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/) of brothers or sisters in Christ to gather with. We are not meant to be alone, and you don’t have to be. If you haven’t taken the step to get into community, or want to know how, check out this [page](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/community).\n  \n7. **Podcast messages you missed.** I know a lot of people will be spending a lot of time traveling, and one way I like to use that time is to listen to sermon podcasts. There are a lot of good sermon options online, but if you want to specifically catch up on The Porch messages you missed, you can find [years of past Porch messages here](http://www.theporch.live/messages). If you want some specific suggestions, you can [learn more about Solomon and Ecclesiastes in this message](http://www.watermark.org/media/solomon-and-the-heart-that-wants-what-it-wants/321/) from way back in Launch 2006, or [this special Christmas message](http://www.watermark.org/media/come-thou-long-expected-jesus/2385/), or learn how to be [satisfied with Christmas](http://www.watermark.org/media/satisfied-with-christmas/1929/) from a couple years ago.\n  \n  \nMark your calendars for a special kickoff Porch on January 16. In the meantime, make good use of the time you have during this Christmas season.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow are you spending your Christmas break?  \n  "},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"6aJOZ3RNXUuE46uwEwwS40"}}},"url":{"en-US":"7-things-to-do-over-christmas-break"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/7-things-to-do-over-christmas-break/"}}},

Our team had word-smithed it, and thought long and hard about the perfect vision we wanted to see happen. But God had other plans...  \n  \nThere was this guy, Simon, who lived in Sweden. Simon had never been inside a church. He did not know who Jesus is. in 2012, Simon wanted to illegally use a trial-version software with a \"watermark\" on it, preventing longterm use. He had a problem. He just needed to get the watermark off the software, so he asked Google how to do so. Google gave him a [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/user/porchdallas/videos) from The Porch at “Watermark.” Simon watched it, and God started working on his heart. He watched more Porch videos, and started live-streaming Watermark's Sunday services. Simon trusted Christ. He joined a church in Sweden. He started a young adult ministry there (they watch The Porch). In 2013 Simon went on to be a missionary in the Philippines, telling everyone he could about the Jesus that changed his life.  \n  \nThen, there was this girl named Aizada. I met her in the Watermark lobby in May, but that was weird because she lives in Kyrgyzstan (don’t worry, I didn’t know where it was either). On a visit to Afghanistan, looking for love and finding significance in men, someone from Dallas told her about The Porch. While in Afghanistan, Aizada found true love in a Man named Jesus. She got on a plane and flew to Dallas for over a month! She didn’t know where she would stay and she had no plan. She just wanted to see the place that talked about Jesus.  \n  \nIn Haiti there was a man named Villerson. Villerson knew Jesus. Villerson went door to door in his own town telling everyone about Jesus. Someone asked me why I didn’t go door to door in Dallas telling everyone about Jesus. Ouch.  \n  \nSo, that’s what some of our Haiti volunteers did when we got back to Dallas. They were [unashamed](http://theporchdallas.com/unashamed/) of the gospel. That effort grew to include about 500 Dallas young adults worshiping one evening in Klyde Warren Park. That got the attention of a security guard at the park, who was also involved with a gang. He had been abandoned by his mother at age 10, and was dealing drugs at 13. He didn’t like God. To quote him, “I don’t need anyone to die for me.” One of our volunteers invited him to The Porch, and he politely declined, saying that he had to work every Tuesday evening. The next day the security guard's boss gave him Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday off. He caught [the last Ecclesiastes message](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/330/) and surrendered to Christ. He then started coming on Sundays, and attending [re:generation](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery/) on Mondays, and went through Connecting Point to [become a church member](http://theporchdallas.com/why-church-membership-is-important/).

If you are not familiar, though, read on.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What is The Porch?**  \n  \nThe Porch is a gathering of about 2,000 Dallas young adults, or people in their twenties and thirties, which meets at Watermark Community Church at 7:00 p.m. on Tuesdays. We meet every Tuesday from January 21 until we break for Christmas in December.  \n  \n  \n  \nOn Tuesdays, we worship through music with Shane & Shane and then discuss what the Bible has to say on topics relevant to [our generation](http://theporch.wpengine.com/generation-why-statistics/), such as [dating](http://theporch.wpengine.com/tag/dating/), careers, [finances](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/266/), and [how to make a difference with our lives](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/257/). Afterwards, people are free to hang out, meet friends, or grab a bite to eat (food trucks are available).  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Porch is not limited to just Tuesdays, though. We strongly encourage and help people to start small [community groups](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-the-big-deal-about-community/) that get together throughout the week. Within these small groups, people can discuss what is going on in their lives and study the Bible together.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe’ll also organize social or service events on the weekends about once a month, and have [one big retreat](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-is-the-launch-retreat/) every year over Labor Day weekend. We help people get involved in different ministries within the church or the community, and our small army of [volunteers](http://theporch.wpengine.com/about-us/serve) are committed to reaching their peers throughout the city (and beyond) both on Tuesdays and throughout the week.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo what do you need to do? Just come and see. The Porch is free and open to anyone. If you have questions or don’t know anyone, find one of the volunteers wearing a lanyard and nametag.

Everything changed when my parents divorced. My mother remarried and I frequently had angry fights with my stepdad. I did not have a relationship with God at this time. I turned to alcohol to numb my emotional pain throughout middle school and high school.\n\n  \n  \n\nOne day when I was 16 years old, I decided to skip school to party with some older football players at my high school. My mission was to get drunk to escape my family drama. At the party, I felt sick and asked for help to find a place to rest. One guy showed me a place to lie down, closed the door, and sexually assaulted me. Another guy heard my screaming, came upstairs, and threw off my attacker. I thought I was rescued, but he closed the door and assaulted me as well.\n\n  \n  \n\nThat day was absolute rock bottom. I blamed myself for the abuse, rationalizing that it was my fault since I had too much to drink. I sunk down into shame, self-hatred, and promiscuity for years.\n\n  \n  \n\n**He Makes All Things New**\n\n  \n\nEven through these dark times, God was at work, drawing me to Himself. Not long after my abuse, girls on my dance team invited me to a student ministry called Young Life. The brokenness of the world made sense as I learned about sin and how everyone has gone astray from God ([Romans 3:23](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3:23)). I heard that the death and resurrection of Jesus completely covered all my sin and an ongoing relationship with the living God was possible for anyone who would trust in God through faith ([Ephesians 2:8-9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A8-9&version=NIV), [Romans 10:9-10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A9-10&version=NIV)). I wanted nothing more than to know this God of unconditional love and surrendered my life to Christ the summer before beginning college at SMU.\n\n  \n  \n\nHowever, even after becoming a Christian, the effects of sexual abuse still hindered my life. I did not have healthy relationships with men, I felt ashamed of myself for not preventing or stopping the abuse, and I had nightmares multiple times per week. A friend encouraged me to go to [Shelter from the Storm](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/shelter/) (Watermark’s sexual abuse recovery ministry).\n\n  \n  \n\nIn Shelter, I learned the truth and it set me free ([John 8:32](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+8%3A32&version=NIV)). I learned that God is near to the brokenhearted and can sympathize with our pain ([Psalm 34:18](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+34%3A18&version=NIV)). Over time, I saw the abuse was not my fault. There is a major distinction between choosing to drink too much and choosing abuse (no one chooses abuse). God removed my feelings of guilt and shame, helped me forgive my abusers, and gave me a passion to see other sexual abuse survivors receive God’s healing.\n\n  \n  \n\n**Set Free to Serve**\n\n  \n\n[Genesis 50:20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+50%3A20&version=NIV) says that what people intend for evil God uses for good to help others. I saw this truth realized as I served within Shelter at Watermark for years. Over time, a group of Shelter volunteers felt called to expand the ministry and take the healing we received to other parts of the world.\n\n  \n  \n\nFrom 2010-2012, I was blessed to be a part of three teams of Shelter volunteers who traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo to minister to other sexual abuse survivors. On each trip, our team shared our testimonies and wept with the Congolese women as we heard their stories of abuse. We assured them of God’s love through His Word and encouraged them to turn to Jesus with their pain. By the end of every trip, the women danced with great joy in gratitude for the hope and restoration God gives. This is just one way I have seen God turn ashes into something beautiful and exchange mourning for joy ([Isaiah 61:1-3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+61%3A1-3&version=NIV)).\n\n  \n  \n\n**Something Only God Could Do**\n\n  \n\nYears later, God still has me connected with Congo. On the first trip to Congo in 2010, a Congelese pastor saw that I loved playing with children. He surprised me by asking if he could name an orphanage after me. I agreed, but doubted anything would come of it due to the instability in Congo. Over the past year, I was stunned to receive emails and photos of precious children from an orphanage called the “Lisa Center” in Goma, Congo!\n\n  \n  \n\nI am now privileged to be a small part of a team of people who work to ensure these children receive physical and spiritual care. I never dreamed such a sweet blessing would come from a mission trip connected with my past abuse.\n\n  \n  \n\nGod truly does allow us to overcome evil with good ([Romans 12:21](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A21&version=NIV)) and is able to do far more abundantly than we could ever ask, imagine, or think ([Ephesians 3:20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+3%3A20&version=NIV))!\n\n  \n  \n\n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

Theologians tend to dance around this issue or take strong stances that ultimately don’t make sense and sometimes seem inconsistent with the character of God. I’ve heard things like, “God is sovereign, but He didn’t create robots.” Or, “In His sovereignty He allows us to choose.” I’m sure you’ve heard many more platitudes that attempt to explain such a highly debated topic.  \n  \n  \n  \nI believe that God is sovereign and can control anything He wants to. I also believe we were created with free will. In our free will we freely choose sin. We continue to become the biggest thing in our own world, selfishly seeking our own desires and thinking much of us. We obsess about opportunities, relationships, possessions, and temporary pleasures. In our sinful state, even our good deeds are often motivated by selfish ambition, such as “I want to feel good about doing good things.”  \n  \n  \n  \nIf we have free will but are naturally selfish and sinful, how does anyone ever choose God over self, and good over sin? One word: revelation. God in His sovereignty reveals Himself to us. God reveals a greater knowledge that affects the choices we can make with our free will. Let me explain: If a child wants to touch a hot stove, they might have the free will to do so. After touching it once, however, they may not have the will to do so again, even if they were sternly commanded to do so. “No! It will burn me! I can’t!” Likewise, a child could be given a choice between a lemon or a piece of chocolate. While the bright glow of the lemon might attract them, their free will would be hindered if they have experienced the goodness of chocolate. The more good the object, the more irresistible it becomes. So, our ability to choose is impacted by knowledge of the object’s goodness and/or knowledge of the negative result from choosing anything else. I call this knowledge “revelation.”  \n  \n  \n  \nGod reveals to us both His goodness (better than chocolate) and the awful things in store for those that refuse His goodness (worse than a hot stove). When God chooses to awaken our heart to His goodness, we are [free to choose that which we know brings life to us](http://www.watermark.org/media/resolved-to-be-free-from-sin/2930/). With the help of the Holy Spirit we begin to avoid that which has been revealed as damaging, when before it was appealing. Our ability to touch the hot stove (or sin) becomes limited based on knowledge of gross consequences and a greater good.  \n  \n  \n  \nOur free will is shaped by [His Word](http://www.jointhejourney.com/), His Spirit, and His people. Sometimes these influences are at war with our own desires. We can freely choose what is right when we:  \n\n  \n- Continually renew our minds ([Romans 12:1-2](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12:1-2)) with the Word of God so we know the desires of God and know what will give life to us.\n  \n- Surrender daily to God’s work in our lives. Pray and listen to His Spirit.\n  \n- Live in [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/) who will continually encourage us and point us in the right direction.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n[God is in control](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-is-in-control/).

It happens far too often. And it happens because of the choices we make, even though that is not a result that anyone would ever willingly choose.  \n  \n  \n  \nMost of those choices take place when people are relatively young—old enough to be making important decisions about their life, but young enough for those decisions to snowball and grow to have disastrous consequences. In other words, these are choices of young adults, which is the prime demographic for [The Porch](http://theporch.wpengine.com/).  \n  \n  \n  \nHow can we avoid making such mistakes? Below are 10 things people can do to ruin their lives while still in their 20s. It is a list of what _not_ to do, or things to stop doing immediately if you don’t want to suffer the results.  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Believe that ideas don’t have consequences.**  \n  \nThis was the biggest lie I believed in my twenties. I thought I could do what I wanted and [get away with it](http://theporch.wpengine.com/getting-away-with-it/); after all, I’m young. But I’ve since learned otherwise. Right now you are in the process of becoming what you will one day be. You are preparing for something. You are either doing the things that will prepare you to be a great spouse, parent, employee, friend, etc.; or, you are preparing to be the opposite of that. Everything you think and do now will lead you down one of those paths.  \n  \n  \n  \n_The simple believe anything,_ _but the prudent give thought to their steps. – Proverbs 14:15_  \n  \n**2. Live outside your means.**  \n  \nAh, Dallas, the city that practically invented the term “[$30k millionaire](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/266/).” But when you spend more than you can afford, you still have to pay for it—plus interest. By living the “good life” now, you ensure you’ll be living the bad life of debt payments, downsizing, financial worries, and delayed/nonexistent retirement in your future decades. Many people today are still paying for experiences that happened years ago, long after the “instant gratification” has been forgotten.  \n  \n  \n  \n_The rich rule over the poor,_ _and the borrower is slave to the lender. – Proverbs 22:7_  \n  \n**3. Feed an addiction.**  \n  \nWhether it is alcohol, money, drugs, pornography, shopping, or whatever, it seems like most people have an addiction of some kind. These addictions bring death: either literal death, or death to relationships, to freedom, and to joy.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow do addictions happen? You feed them. I’ve been addicted to several things, and each of them took work to develop. You don’t drink one beer and immediately get addicted; it takes repetition, just like exercise. The more you do a thing, the stronger the addiction grows, and the harder it is to stop doing it. Stop now; it will only be harder with “one last time.”  \n  \n  \n  \n_The righteousness of the upright delivers them,_ _but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires. – Proverbs 11:6_  \n  \n**4. Run with fools.**  \n  \nFact: you are becoming who you hang around with. It’s been said you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. You do what they do (because you’re doing it together), you pick up on their ideas and beliefs, and you even learn their mannerisms and language.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo if you hang around with idiots, or addicts, or criminals, that’s what you will become. But if you hang around with wise people, who are committed to following Christ and to making a difference with their lives, then that is what you’ll become. [Change your playmates and playground](http://theporch.wpengine.com/changing-playground-and-playmates/).  \n  \n  \n  \n_Walk with the wise and become wise,_ _for a companion of fools suffers harm. – Proverbs 13:20_  \n  \n**5. Carelessly give your heart away.**  \n  \nWant heartbreak? Give your heart to someone who will break it. And how do you know who will break it? _Everyone_ will, except for someone who truly commits to protecting your heart and loving you until the end, no matter what. If they are really willing to commit to that, they will gladly do so officially through marriage vows. So, only give your heart away once—at your wedding. Until then, be careful with your heart. Be careful with what entertains it and what you allow it to seek. You may not be able to choose who you love, but you can choose who you let love grow with.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Above all else, guard your heart,_ _for everything you do flows from it. – Proverbs 4:23_  \n  \n**6. Tolerate evil.**  \n  \nYou’ve probably heard the quote: “The only thing necessary for evil to prevail is for good people to do nothing.” Well, it’s true. Because there is evil in the world, actively seeking to destroy others, and if nobody opposes those actions they will succeed. And then eventually you’ll be the target.  \n  \n  \n  \n“Tolerance” is a big word right now, and is often held up as an absolute good—that you should always tolerate every person and every idea. But some people kill. Some take part in [sex trafficking](http://theporch.wpengine.com/sex-trafficking-the-problem-and-the-solution/). Some promote ideas of genocide or infanticide, or argue that they should be able to sleep with whomever they feel like. God does not tolerate sin; He paid for it. Stand against evil, or one day there may be no one left to stand for you.  \n  \n_To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. Proverbs 8:13_  \n  \n**7. Make secondary things ultimate and ultimate things secondary.**  \n  \nIf an outsider were to observe how you spend your time and resources, what would they end up saying your life is about? Making money? Looking good? Fantasy football? Would they say you worship God, or worship that 60-inch HD TV?  \n  \n  \n  \nThere is nothing wrong with working, or working out, or having hobbies, or being interested in the opposite sex. Those are all good things, _if_ you don’t go overboard and make them the focus of your life. They are all secondary, the side dishes of an eternal life. God is ultimate, is the very reason you are here, and is the only one of those things that will last forever.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Keep falsehood and lies far from me;_ _give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread.<sup> </sup>Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, ‘Who is the Lord?’ Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God. – Proverbs 30:8-9_  \n  \n**8. Believe that this life is all about you.**  \n  \nYou are one of seven billion people alive currently, and though you _are_ special, so is each of the other 6,999,999,999—and the billions who have come before but are now long dead and forgotten.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou are not the star of this show. You have a cameo that will be forgotten as soon as the screen changes.  \n  \n  \n  \nPeople who become the biggest thing in their world are dysfunctional. They have a skewed view. They will always end up either disappointed or delusional. And when they go, their world disappears; they don’t actually leave any impact.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you do want to be important and make a difference, live for God. Resolve to give your life away for something bigger, and make an impact on the people around you.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. – Proverbs 16:18_  \n  \n**9. Live for immediate gratification.**  \n  \nAlmost nothing truly worthwhile comes quickly. It takes time and discipline to become an Olympic athlete, or to simply get in shape; to get a degree, or become a CPA, or become a great husband or wife. And any of the things you truly want long-term can be derailed by indulging yourself in the moment.  \n  \n  \n  \nDo you want an amazing marriage, or just one amazing night? Do you want to retire in 36 years, or drive a luxury car for the next 36 months? Because in each case, choosing the latter makes it more difficult (or impossible) to have the former. Don’t choose [ramen over riches](http://theporch.wpengine.com/choosing-ramen/).  \n  \n  \n  \n_The wise store up choice food and olive oil, but fools gulp theirs down. – Proverbs 21:20_  \n  \n**10. Avoid accountability.**  \n  \nWe all have the tendency to screw up, or be blind to our own failings, or to convince ourselves that we can change on our own even though it’s never worked in the past.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s why God created us to live in community with others: so we can encourage each other, or point out blind spots, or have help in times of weakness.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut are you running to community and accountability, or running away from it? Some people avoid it like the plague. The only reason you avoid accountability is because you don’t want to be corrected, even though that means you then continue to do the things that ruin your life. If you really want to change, and really want to put God first every day, then do the one simple thing that makes that possible: [Christ-centered community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/).  \n  \n  \n  \n_Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,_ _but whoever hates correction is stupid. – Proverbs 12:1_  \n  \nThere you have it: how to ruin your life in 10 simple steps. Now please don’t. Instead, make these your resolutions:  \n\n  \n1. Resolve to walk with God this year.\n  \n2. Resolve to live below your means.\n  \n3. Resolve to starve addictions.\n  \n4.

A young college student made a choice to give me up when I was born. Six weeks later, my parents, who could not have kids, brought me home. They would go on to adopt 5 more children.  \n  \nGrowing up, I found myself needing approval, lying to cover up failures, and wresting with feelings of rejection. My parents spent less time with me because I tended not to get in trouble and other siblings needed more of their attention. As a family, we were involved in church from my early years until we moved from New Orleans to a small town in Mississippi the summer before I started high school. While I believed in Jesus and had prayed to accept Him as a child, my desire for approval and the culture shock of leaving the city for the country started a difficult road in my life. I began drinking in 10th grade and started down the path of crossing sexual boundaries with girls.  \n  \nAround this time, I began to struggle with depression. I felt a hole inside and no matter how much “fun” I tried to have, the hole felt like it was growing. Things didn’t change in college. My depression and anxiety got worse and a number of times my mind went to the idea of suicide.  \n  \nIn the middle of my junior year, my mom passed away on Christmas morning. I was numb and didn’t know what to make of life. I poured myself into school and graduated. After working for a year, I decided to attend grad school. During my first week, I ran into a girl I hadn’t seen in a few years and we hit it off. We moved into together six months later and in a year we were married. Four months in, she started sleeping around. I was devastated and, in time, divorced.  \n  \n**The Real Adoption Process**  \nThe next 4 years of grad school were a blur of papers, teaching, working, a couple of inappropriate relationships, counseling, anxiety medication, near bankruptcy, and drinking. As I wrapped up my last year of grad courses, I was dating a practicing Hindu. I tried every way to justify the relationship because we matched so well. One day, however, she said “I will never believe in your God and I will never read the Bible.” Immediately I felt my whole inner being shake and all I could hear in my head and heart was “are you going to choose Me or her; the Eternal or the temporal.” For a week I fought those thoughts and feelings but in the end, I said “God, I’m choosing You.” We broke up and within two months, God had moved me San Antonio for a job and my old life was left behind. I confessed my sin and, on my knees, prayed to start over with Him.  \n  \nOver the next several years, I experienced tremendous growth, including getting off of anxiety medication, paying off my significant credit card debt, serving at church, and leading worship. In the Fall of 2008, I accepted a job opportunity in my company that brought me to Dallas. I was ready to go deeper with the Lord and excited about the change.  \n  \n**The Test of Trust**  \nAfter attending Watermark for 8 months, I started leading worship for [Re:Generation](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery/). In the spring of 2010, a routine doctor visit revealed a softball-sized tumor in my chest. The doctor told me that given where the tumor was located, there was a risk that I could lose my voice and full function of my right arm. Despite that news, I felt peace. Real peace. All of the time God had been working prepared me for this time. The surgery went as well as it could possibly go. For the first time in my life, both my head and my heart were able to grasp the fullness of God’s abundant love. How? Through His people and His mercy. I was served lovingly by so many people during that time. My community group guys, close friends, family, people from work, people I’d never met – all showed me God’s love in a tangible, real way. My heart for people changed. My perspective on life changed. My gratitude changed. Anxiety was broken. Fear was defeated. I’ve never been the same."},"url":{"en-US":"adopted"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/adopted/"}}},

Perhaps you don’t know where to ask her out _to_. Maybe you’re new to the area, or you’ve [changed your playground and playmates](http://theporch.wpengine.com/changing-playground-and-playmates/) and need some new ideas that don’t rely on your old definition of “fun.”  \n  \n  \n  \nTo help, we asked around about some creative, clean, low-pressure date spots around DFW. Something besides just dinner or coffee, since you have plenty of options for that. And we tried to limit it to ideas that weren’t that expensive ($15 or less per person) since we are also proponents of [good financial stewardship](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-stewardship-challenge/). We came up with 14 ideas, but feel free to add your own in the comments at the end.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Less Than 15 Dallas Date Ideas for Less Than $15**  \n  \n**1.**  **Klyde Warren Park**  \n[This downtown/arts district park](http://www.klydewarrenpark.org/) has quickly become one of the most popular cool spots in Dallas. Yes, it’s a park—and is built on top of a highway—but it has food trucks, a restaurant, wifi, a dog park, a reading area stocked with reading materials, chess, croquet, ping pong, a putting green, and petanque (whatever that is). And the price is right: everything but the food is free.  \n  \n  \n  \nAlso, this Friday (February 21, 2014) a couple hundred Porchies will be there at 8 p.m. for an open-air worship night called “Awaken.” Everyone is welcome to join; [check out the Facebook page for details](https://www.facebook.com/events/581386485288126/).  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. The Dallas Museum of Art**  \nRight next to Klyde Warren Park is [the DMA](http://www.dma.org/), which is now also free all the time (except for special exhibits). It normally closes at 5 p.m., except for Thursday evenings and the [Late Nights](http://www.dma.org/programs/late-nights) on the third Friday of every month (which is also this Friday). During Late Nights you can also check out the [Nasher Sculpture Center](http://www.nashersculpturecenter.org) next door for free, and the [Crow Collection of Asian Art](http://crowcollection.org) right next to that. All are open until midnight on third Fridays.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Fort Worth Museum District**  \nOn the FW side of DFW, Fort Worth has its own collection of art museums. [The Amon Carter Museum of American Art](http://www.cartermuseum.org) and the [Kimbell Art Museum](https://www.kimbellart.org) are both free and well worth a visit. Next to the Kimbell is the [Modern Art Musuem of Fort Worth](http://themodern.org), which costs $10, but is free on the first Sunday of every month. Next to the Amon Carter is the [National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame](http://www.cowgirl.net), which is also $10.  \n  \n**4. Fort Worth Zoo**  \nOK, so there’s both the [Dallas Zoo](http://www.dallaszoo.com) and the [Fort Worth Zoo](http://www.fortworthzoo.org) to choose from, but most people seem to agree that the one in Fort Worth is the better of the two. Admission is $12. You may think of the zoo as a place for kids, but an unscientific poll of two grown women showed that they both thought it was a great date idea.  \n  \n**5. Fort Worth Stockyards**  \nReal cowboys might scoff at its touristy nature, but for city slickers [the Stockyards](http://www.fortworthstockyards.org/Index.aspx) do allow you to see cattle drives, gunfights, and wild west shows, while browsing through blocks of western-themed shops. There is also a [rodeo every Friday and Saturday night](http://stockyardsrodeo.com), though that will cost you a whopping $17.50. (During the summers on the opposite side of the Metroplex, you can attend the [Mesquite Rodeo](http://www.mesquiterodeo.com/) any Friday or Saturday night for $14.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**6. White Rock Lake**  \nThe lake, and the park and 9-mile trail that surrounds it, is a good place to watch a sunset, have a picnic, go for a walk, or (for the athletic/outdoorsy types) go running, biking, or roller blading. [Kayaks can be rented](http://www.whiterockpaddle.com) for $14.99 an hour, or a two-seater canoe for $10 per person.  \n  \n  \n  \n**7. Dallas Arboretum**  \nGirls love flowers, and the [Arboretum](http://www.dallasarboretum.org) has 66 acres of them. Hard to go wrong here, guys, as long as the weather is nice. Tickets for non-members are normally $15, but next week (February 24-28, 2014) it’s only $5 per person.  \n  \n  \n  \n**8. Movies at**  **Valley View AMC**  \nThere are plenty of movie theaters around, including multiple AMCs, so why list this one? [Because it’s cheap](https://www.amctheatres.com/movie-theatres/amc-valley-view-16#19523). All movies are $6 unless they start before 4 p.m., in which case it’s only $4. And yes, these are first-run movies; the same as the ones you would pay twice as much for at the NorthPark AMC. NorthPark is a million times better mall than Valley View, but the theaters aren’t really that different.  \n  \n  \n  \nOr, with a little drive, a much more creative movie option is…  \n  \n  \n  \n**9. Galaxy Drive-In Theater**  \nAbout 30 miles south of downtown Dallas, where it gets dark enough to actually project movies outside, there is the six-screen [Galaxy Drive-In Theater](http://www.galaxydriveintheatre.com). Tickets there are also $6, but for that you get two movies (a double-feature) and a neat 1950s vibe.  \n  \n  \n  \n**10. Plaza Theatre Company**  \nStarting from downtown Fort Worth instead, head 30 miles south to Cleburne and you can watch a live play at the [Plaza Theatre Company](http://plaza-theatre.com). They have shows every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evening, as well as a Saturday afternoon matinee. It’s a theatre in the round, which means any seat is a good seat and you’re way up close to the action (you can’t stick your feet out in the front row because you might trip one of the actors).  \n  \n  \n  \n**11. Shakespeare in the Park**  \nDuring the summer, you can catch some outdoor theater with [Shakespeare in the Park](http://www.shakespearedallas.org) at the Samuell Grand Amphitheatre. Oddly enough, some of the shows are not actually by Shakespeare. Tickets are $10 each.  \n  \n  \n  \n**12. North Texas Outdoor Pursuit Center**  \nFor a little more real-life drama, you can try your hand at the 120-foot indoor rock climbing walls at Carrolton’s [North Texas Outdoor Pursuit Center](http://www.northtexasopc.com). If you can make sense of their daily specials, you can get your climb on for $8 - $15 per person. There are other local rock climbing gyms as well, but this is the only one built inside an old grain elevator, and therefore taller than a 10-story building.  \n  \n  \n  \n**13. McKinney Square**  \nHistoric downtown McKinney features [Second Saturdays](http://www.mckinneytexas.org/index.aspx?NID=564), which is a time to explore the local shops, art galleries, and restaurants. (No, not [that 2<sup>nd</sup> Saturday](https://www.facebook.com/2ndSaturdayorg), though that would be a creative way to serve together as a couple—and since they occur at different times of the day, you could do both.) The second Saturday this April is McKinney Square’s annual [Arts in Bloom](http://www.mckinneytexas.org/index.aspx?NID=687), when you can take an ArtWalk and see work by over 100 local artists. Both are free, unless you buy something.  \n  \n  \n  \n**14. The Porch**  \nOK, so not a traditional date idea, but it is the place to be on Tuesday evenings. Outside of Tuesdays, we regularly have events like the Valentine’s party at Bowl and Barrel last week. It’s a way to date in community, the same way that dates used to happen on the front porch where the family and community could see. We’ll let you know about events when we meet on Tuesdays, and you can also check [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/theporchdallas) for invites.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat’s your favorite date idea in or around DFW?  \n  \n  \n  \n_Photo credit: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xvisionx\\_Dallas\\_Stemmons.jpg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xvisionx_Dallas_Stemmons.jpg)_\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"less-than-15-dallas-date-ideas-for-less-than-15"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/less-than-15-dallas-date-ideas-for-less-than-15/"}}},

The amount of stuff in the lives of or on the minds of the people interacting in the Porch Café on any given Tuesday would be enough to break the entire publishing industry.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Gospels, or the story of Jesus in the New Testament, end with these words:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. (John 21:25)_  \n  \n  \n  \nIf that sounds like a gross exaggeration for a man who spent only 33 years on earth, consider this: Jesus is still at work. He is still working on and working in people, including myself and yourself and the self of that guy over there that you’re afraid to talk to. That guy’s story alone could fill volumes, both funny and heartbreaking, with foreshadowing and shocking twists and great triumphs that may or may not have been written yet.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut what good is a story if it is not told?  \n  \n  \n  \nAt The Porch, we want to be a community that both makes and shares stories. A forum of honesty, and care, and celebration. Jesus is still at work, though it is usually in spite of, not because of, anything we do. The hurting are getting help, the lonely are becoming known, and the walking dead are finding true life. There are even people physically alive and in our midst today who would otherwise be dead and buried. (Read that sentence again; it is literally true.) More importantly, there are people who will live forever, and for whom [the grave no longer holds any power](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:54-55&version=NIV1984).  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat’s your story? We want to know. Take five minutes to write it down, or take two minutes after The Porch and we’ll grab a camera to film it. We’ll share the stories [here](http://theporch.wpengine.com/category/our-stories/) to celebrate what is being done.  \n  \n  \n  \nDon’t like the way your story is currently being played out?

It sounded fun, kinda like a rollercoaster. This was my first real suicidal thought and it marked the beginning of my battle with depression.  \n  \nAlthough I have always struggled with anxiety and depression, it took almost 20 years for me to do something about it. You can form a lot of bad habits in 20 years. I covered up my low self-esteem and anxiety with boyfriends, achievements, food, smoking and alcohol –whatever it took to look normal. Underneath my self-sufficiency, I felt overwhelmed, angry, and very scared.  \n  \nI had a relationship with God and even prayed and read Scripture but none of that made this problem go away. In fact, when I prayed, the burden weighed heavier as I realized how my life didn’t measure up to God’s standard. I didn’t want to be a nun or anything, I just wanted to live my life and be happy.  \n  \nFrom the time I had my first suicidal thoughts, to the time I completely surrendered my life to Christ it would be 10 more years – 10 more years of attempting to manage my situation my way, with alcohol, anti-depressants, counseling, food, sexual gratification, exercise and dieting. It was exhausting. Most of the time I thought, _“If I could just \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, then I would be happy.”_ It was a rat race and I was running on the little wheel thinking I was getting somewhere.  \n  \n**Breeching of the Gates**  \nIf I hadn’t had a friend approach me about the life I was living apart from God, I don’t know if I would have ever stopped. She had hard conversations with me, prayed for me and invited me to her church. God used her influence to remind me that my way wasn’t working. Proverbs 16:25 says:  \n  \n_“There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.”_  \n  \nI knew that in the past I had sought God in part, but I had kept ultimate control. I was still king of my own castle. Until I let God be the King that He is – over every part of my life – I wouldn’t find any rest. Jesus reflects this idea in Matthew 11:28-30 when He says:  \n  \n_“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”_  \n  \nHe doesn’t say that He takes all the difficulty away, but He gives us a different burden – one that’s light and one that allows for us to rest.  \n  \n**Satisfaction in the Kingdom**  \nEverything about my life has changed. Now, I find myself full of joy and peace – the real deal!! I smile from my heart, not because I’m supposed to be happy, or because I want others to think everything’s okay. I spend time with God and with loving friends that help me to excel in character, not in outward appearances or worldly status. The guilt and shame I used to carry have slipped off of my shoulders. I now make different choices that honor the Lord and others more than myself. I let God soften my hard heart and in turn He has healed old wounds. Every day my peace grows, knowing that Jesus is making all things new, even a wretch like me."},"url":{"en-US":"concealment-before-release"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/concealment-before-release/"}}},

Your car starts to sputter, until it turns off and you're left coasting down the road on momentum alone. This past week, my family and I ran across a young lady who was stranded on the side of the road. Her car hadn't just run out of gas, it had died. It was clear that it had not been well cared for and the components that make the car drive down the road were no longer functioning properly. This can happen to us as humans, if we do not properly maintain our temporary vessels of life, and run at a sustainable pace. This refueling and maintenance is often referred to as Sabbath.  \n\nWhen I've talked on the topic of Sabbath, I've been surprised by the response to the messages. It seems people really struggle to have a Sabbath rest. Furthermore, I've been surprised that most people don't even understand what it looks like to Sabbath today.\n \nIn these messages, I've addressed my own challenges with managing my pace. Thankfully, the leadership at Watermark makes Sabbath rest a priority, emphasizing work-life balance and demonstrating what it looks like to abide in Jesus. I’ve been continually encouraged by their vested interest in my pace and life balance.\n \nSo, I wanted to share some principles I’ve learned at Watermark regarding rest:\n \n \n  \n**1. Be responsible for your own rest.**  \nNo one can rest for you. It is not your boss’ responsibility to make sure you are running at a sustainable pace. While mine does an incredible job of asking questions around this, I’ve learned this is the exception to the rule. If you feel yourself running thin, it is important to let those around you know you’re reaching your limit.  \n  \n  \n**2. Audit your pace.**  \nEveryone needs checks and balances. You will not always know how “hot” you are running, unless you stop to take an assessment. It’s wise to have external auditors—preferably people you are in [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/) with—who you discuss your pace with and invite to speak into your life. Schedule a time each week to audit your pace and effectiveness that week, and determine where you need to make changes.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Recognize that not everyone runs at the same speed or needs the same rest.**  \nIf I sprinted 40 yards, it would take me a while to recover. (Yes, just 40 yards. That’s not a typo.) My hands would be on my knees and my breathing would be heavy. I know other people who can sprint a mile, and recover more quickly. If I tried to keep up with them I would wear myself out! Likewise, not everyone will have the same pace in life. There are indeed “high-capacity” individuals who appear to be going all-out, but are actually operating in their “sweet spot.” But if that’s not you (and it’s probably not) don’t burn yourself out trying to keep up.  \n  \n  \n  \nYour value does not come from the pace you run. If you think it does, this will quickly lead to burnout. Your value comes from God, Who made you in His image and did the most important work on your behalf. You are valuable because you are His, and you only need to run at the pace He designed you to run.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Realize that everyone does need rest.**  \nGod made us to need rest. Think about it. If you don’t sleep you will get mentally ill, and eventually die. He fine-tuned our environment to evolve around rest. He even turns out the lights every night to allow for it. It is a brilliant design that we take for granted. He could have made us to go 24/7/365 and never stop, but He didn’t. In fact, God took the Sabbath off on the seventh day of creation, even though He is all-powerful and therefore doesn’t need rest. God is clearly communicating something important, and is saying that at some point your work needs to stop.  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. Don’t obsess over how you are doing.**  \nI’ve learned that the topic of pace and rest stresses people out. We are like hypochondriacs who begin to feel “sick” because we are talking about it. “Maybe I am running too hard and too fast. What if I am and I didn’t even know it?” We stress, which is the opposite of rest, and turn good things like quiet times into yet another item on our to-do list.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is why you need others speaking into your life, who can objectively see how you really are. Set a time each week to stop and ask “How am I doing?” If you do that, you’ll be fine.  \n  \n  \n  \n**6. Trust that God is in control.**  \nIt’s really more about trusting than resting. If you trust that [God is in control](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-is-in-control/) and knows what He is doing, you can rest well without worrying that the world will somehow fall apart during your absence.  \n  \n  \n  \nRest = trust. This was my number one takeaway in studying Sabbath.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou can’t save the world, and you can’t save yourself, no matter how hard you try. You’ll live and you’ll do something with your life, and then you will die. Probably sooner than you think. And that’s totally OK. If you’ve trusted in God’s provision of forgiveness through Jesus, you will be just fine. Do everything you can and then go to sleep. You can’t do it all and God is in control anyways.  \n\n– JP\n\n\n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"5dudX2UqZGEGwegUIG2Kss"}}},"url":{"en-US":"6-ways-to-avoid-burnout"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/6-ways-to-avoid-burnout/"}}},

Though we were constantly in and out of motel rooms, my mom did her best to keep a roof over our head. My father was absent and I would yearn for his attention and love, but would ultimately be disappointed. Sexually abused by a “Christian” family member as a child, the Christians in my life left me doubting there was a God who loved me.  \n  \nAs a teenager, with the lack of a father's love and an early sexual curiosity, I ended up seeking boys’ attention. I tried to fill the hole in my heart with the need to be wanted. I became pregnant at 15 with a boyfriend who filled me with false hope. I felt betrayed, lost, unloved, and unworthy.  \n  \n**A Flicker of Hope**  \nWith the father of my unborn child engaged to another, and with many so-called \"friends\" abandoning me, I went to high school with the determination to get out as soon as possible. Everyone noticed my big belly, and everyone seemed to judge me. A caring teacher told me about a new Young Life program for teen moms, and I was very open to hearing what they had to say. Once there, I was showered with nothing but love and support. I didn't feel judged; I met girls going through the same struggles, and found people who genuinely cared.  \n  \nThrough this Young Life program, I went on a retreat to Arizona. On the last night, I went out into the silent night and accepted Christ into my heart. As I looked up at the thousands of stars, I felt an unforgettable sense of hope and peace. Coming home, I felt like a new person. Unfortunately, after graduating, I lost contact with my support system and didn't get plugged into a church home. Soon after, the world started to surround me and I lost my way.  \n  \n**The Growing Hole**  \nI started going out to clubs and house parties. I would leave my son for days with my mom, wouldn't show up to work, and started to drink heavily as the hole in my heart began to open wider. I became involved in inappropriate relationships with men, one which was abusive emotionally and physically. I became pregnant again, but this time I wasn't so sure I could care for another child. I was already neglecting one. The decision was made clear when I was given an ultimatum by my boyfriend: “Either get an abortion or I will kill myself.” I thought I loved him and he gave me false promises that I held on to.  \n  \nTwo days after I had my baby removed from my body, he hurt me for the last time and left me. I was in bed for days, not from the injuries, but because I was so depressed. I didn't want to live. I was taken to a psychiatrist who placed me on high doses of anti-depressants. The hole in my heart seemed to take over my entire torso now. I eventually found a different doctor who wanted to wean me off medication and told me, “While you go through this process you need to be doing things that are healthy for you. If you have a faith, go back to it.” “Faith?” I thought. I called myself a Christian, but I wondered if God would even let me into heaven after all that I had done.  \n  \n**Remaining in the Vine**   \nI decided to start my church search, worked hard to get off my meds, went back to college, and started to develop a relationship with my son. But my own works weren't enough. I got a good job, started to date, and would even go every Sunday and Wednesday to church, but the hole was still there. I was disappointed, mainly at myself. Nothing I did seemed to work out for me.  \n  \nI was invited to Watermark in August 2012 by a neighbor. At The Porch, I heard [a message on forgiveness](http://www.watermark.org/media/forgiveness/2199/) that left me in tears. I had so much bitterness and anger towards the fathers of my children, my own father, and even myself. I knew something had to change. I cried out to God and surrendered my life, because I knew I couldn't do it anymore. The Holy Spirit led me to my Bible, specifically to the Gospel of John and I was convicted by chapter 15.  \n  \n“Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.” ([John 15:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A4&version=NIV)) I had been trying so hard to do things on my own, to change my life by my own works. It took me realizing that apart from the Lord, I can do nothing. It is only by remaining in him that my life could change and start to bear fruit.  \n  \nThrough choosing to remain in the vine, I started to [volunteer at The Porch](http://theporch.wpengine.com/about-us/serve/), took [Equipped Disciple](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/equipped-disciple/), found a mentor, got into [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/), and found more healing in [Someone Cares](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/someone-cares--abortion-restoration/), a ministry for women who have experienced abortion. My life took a 180° turn. My mom became a believer, my son started to love the church, my relationships were strengthened, and I even got hired on to Young Life staff! But most importantly, I found that God loved me and that hole was finally filled. I fully grasped what Jesus had done for my sins, what He did with my mess, and I became His humble and faithful servant.  \n  \n_“He has made everything beautiful in its time.

They end. They break up long before marriage.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd that’s OK. I mean, it’s not great, and it’s not fun, and it ideally would never be necessary. But if you are in the wrong relationship, then it _is_ necessary, and should happen sooner rather than later. Otherwise there will just be more hurt, heartache, and regrets when it does inevitably end.  \n  \n  \n  \nLast Tuesday at The Porch we discussed the topic of [when to break up and when not to](http://www.watermark.org/media/when-to-break-up-and-when-not-to/2990/). We covered the reasons why people should break up pretty fast, so we thought we should expand upon it and add a few to the list.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, here are nine situations where you should probably break up:  \n  \n**1.**  **When wise people around you are raising concerns about the relationship.**  \n  \nWe believe there are three ways God most often speaks: His Word, His Spirit, and His people. The counsel of godly men or women in our lives is a provision from God to protect us and guide us ([Proverbs 15:22](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+15%3A22&version=NIV)). They can help us see things that we miss when we are blinded by emotions. If the [community of believers in your life](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/) is raising questions and concerns about whether you should move forward with the person you are dating, you should listen to what they have to say.  \n  \n**2.**  **When they are not a follower of Christ.**  \n  \nThis is a crucial one. If you are not on the same page about who will be your Master (Jesus), then you need to get out now. Go read Paul’s words in [2 Corinthians 6:14](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+6%3A14&version=NIV). Followers of Christ are to _minister_ to non-believers, not _marry_ them. Missionary dating is a bad idea; if they are not following Christ now, chances are they won’t be in marriage.  \n  \n**3.**  **When you are not moving towards marriage.**  \n  \nIf you have been perpetually dating someone for 12 years, it may be time to move on. As believers in Christ, dating should be a _path_, that leads to a _promise_, that leads to a lifelong _pursuit_ (marriage). It is not a parking lot, or a road leading to some unknown end. Dating should not be used to fill our insecurities, meet our sexual needs, or be done casually. The (very recent) modern idea of dating for fun or sport is dangerous because your heart either will get damaged or become numb. As King Solomon said and Jesus later taught ([Luke 6:45](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A45&version=NIV)) you live from your heart, so above everything else guard it ([Proverbs 4:23](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+4%3A23&version=NIV)).  \n  \n**4.**  **When you are not on the same page about sexual purity.**  \n  \nSex is powerful. It is an amazing gift that God has given us, for a specific purpose: bonding. It is meant to unite a man and a woman in a way that is well beyond the scope of this post to describe. But it is powerful. My wife is a counselor, and every time someone comes to her and wants to share something they have carried with them in secret for years, she always knows what it will be about: sex. It uniquely impacts us in the deepest level of our being in ways that nothing else does. In [1 Corinthians 6:18-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A18-20&version=NIV), Paul tells us to flee sexual immorality because it impacts us like no other sin. One of the ways we flee this is by ending a relationship where we are being pressured into having sex.  \n  \n**5.**  **When you are living together.**  \n  \nThis one may not always be a reason to break up, but you should definitely move out and take a hard look at the relationship. Despite what our culture suggests, moving in together physically before you have moved together emotionally and spiritually is something that almost never ends well. God’s grace is big; He loves you and wants you to wake up to a spouse who is committed to loving you forever, not to a boyfriend/roommate who can leave at any moment.  \n  \n**6.**  **When one or both of you need time to heal.**  \n  \nLife is hard. We all have our issues: baggage from our childhood, past relationships, and just being alive in a messed world. Sin includes actions done by us, to us, or in our presence that can leave us with scars that need to heal. There may be a time in a relationship where you discover you or the person you are dating needs time to heal. Dating can bring things to the surface we didn’t even know where there; huge icebergs can lie below the surface and often not visible clearly. Temporarily pausing our dating life to heal may be the best gift you can give to your future spouse—and the most honoring thing to God, as you trust His timing.  \n  \n**7.**  **When you are not growing in affection towards each other.**  \n  \nIf you don’t enjoy being with the other person, and look forward to being with them, it may be time to consider moving on. Husbands and wives are called to love and respect each other ([Ephesians 5:28-33](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5%3A28-33&version=NIV)), and we are told to enjoy life with the spouse God has given us ([Ecclesiastes 9:9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+9%3A9&version=NIV)). This may be difficult to do in marriage if you are not enjoying being with them when dating.  \n  \n**8.**  **When they push you away from Christ rather than towards Him.**  \n  \nThe whole purpose of your life and mine is to love God and love others ([Matthew 22:37-40](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A37-40&version=NIV)). If you are in a relationship that is making this more difficult to do, or distracting you from doing so, it may be time to move on.  \n  \n**9.**  **Before you get married.**  \n  \nThis past Tuesday we discussed divorce, and Jesus’ radical perspective on the permanence of marriage. But regardless of your beliefs or your view on divorce, most people would agree that a broken marriage is worse than a broken dating relationship. That’s why it is vital that you determine whether you should break up _now_, instead of committing to a marriage that will only bring you pain and a broken family.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are dating someone and the above scenarios apply to you, it may be worth breaking up now. This will be painful, but not as painful as a broken marriage would be. Consult your community of believers around you, and listen to the advice given in the Bible. God loves you, and He’s not trying to spoil your fun; He wants to preserve your future marriage."},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1Vei3ry7I08YayyOg8s88o"}}},"url":{"en-US":"9-signs-you-should-break-up"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/9-signs-you-should-break-up/"}}},

You don’t even have to see the movie to know that it is, of course, about Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut one interesting aspect of the greatest story ever told is that it gets told _a lot_, and not always in such an obvious way. The Bible says that God has [set eternity in the hearts of men](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3:11), which means that the story of God’s unfailing love for us and the sacrifice made through Jesus’ death and resurrection will always tug at our heartstrings—even if we only get a shadow or a reflection of that story in a different form.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, as moviemakers strive to craft stories that will resonate with people and draw them in emotionally, they often draw from elements of the Christ story. Sometimes it’s intentional; other times, it’s just a storyteller going with what seems to work.  \n  \n  \n  \nWant proof? Well, here are five examples of very secular movies that, either intentionally or unintentionally, actually contain retellings of the story of Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \n(Here be spoilers.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. _Superman Returns_**  \nLast year’s _Man of Steel_ got a lot of attention for its intentional Christ references. In fact, the studio created [a website just for pastors](http://manofsteelresources.com/) to help them build sermons around the themes in the Superman reboot.  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, it’s the previous film in the franchise, _Superman Returns_, that provided the original inspiration for this list.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn all versions of the Superman story, an otherworldly father sends his son—his “[only son](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&version=NIV),” as the father emphasizes—to Earth to be [a “light” to all of humanity](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:12&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nBut at the beginning of this movie, the son has been absent, [away in the heavens](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+1%3A10-11&version=NIV), and many doubt he will ever return. Lois Lane even writes an article stating that Superman isn’t needed, and specifically says that “The world doesn't need a savior. And neither do I.” Of course, Superman _does_ end up saving her from certain death, and then goes about [saving everyone else who cries out for help](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10:13&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nIn the movie’s climax, Superman gets [stabbed in his side](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+19:34&version=NIV), takes the weight of the world (or at least a continent) on his shoulders, and strikes a crucifix pose as he dies. But then a nurse—[a woman going to take care of his body](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A1&version=NIV)—discovers that he has risen from the dead when she [finds his hospital room empty](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+24%3A2-3&version=NIV). He then appears to Lois and tells her that “[I’m always around](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A20&version=NIV)” before [ascending into the sky](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1%3A9&version=NIV).  \n  \n[![Superman Jesus](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/supermanreturns41.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/supermanreturns41.jpg)  \n  \n**2. _The Matrix_**  \nThe Wachowski Brothers drew from many influences when making _The Matrix_, but the Christian references are some of the most obvious.  \n  \n  \n  \nThink about it: [in accordance with prophecy](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+2%3A4-6&version=NIV), a man called “The One,” who is part of a trinity, which even includes a person named Trinity, along with a father figure (Morpheus), leaves a place called “[Zion](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11:26&version=NIV)” and enters the world we know in order to [save humanity from a slavery that they don’t even recognize as such](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A31-36&version=NIV). He faces off against the [rulers of this world](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6:12&version=NIV), who deride him for being “[Only human](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+2:17&version=NIV).” But after he [demonstrates that he has supernatural powers](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+7%3A20-23&version=NIV), those authorities kill him—only to have him come back to life and prove he has power over them, too.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe film ends with Neo explaining to the forces of evil that he is going to show the world a different, better way of living—“[a world without you](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A6-14&version=NIV).” He then also flies off into the heavens.  \n  \n[![Green Mile Halo](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/greenmilehalo.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/greenmilehalo.jpg)  \n  \n**3. _The Green Mile_**  \nThis one might not be quite as obvious, but it is still there.  \n  \n  \n  \nAn innocent, gentle giant of a man, with the initials J.C., is wrongfully [convicted of a crime he didn’t commit and sentenced to death](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+23%3A22-24&version=NIV). In the time leading up to his execution, he [heals multiple people of different diseases](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+4:40&version=NIV) and even brings one character (a mouse) [back from the dead](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11%3A38-44&version=NIV). And he heals them in an unusual way: by [taking the diseases upon himself](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53:6&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nThe [chief guard overseeing the executions becomes convinced that J.C. is for real](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+15:39&version=NIV), and offers to let him go free. However, [J.C. willingly chooses to let himself be executed](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A53-54&version=NIV). Whereas other death-row inmates say “I’m sorry for what I did” before their execution, J.C. says “I’m sorry for what I am.” He had done nothing wrong, and was [killed simply for who he was](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+14%3A61-64&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nAt the end, it is revealed that the resurrected mouse is still alive more than 60 years later, and that people healed by J.C. live an incredibly long time—possibly even [forever](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10:28&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. _The Dark Knight Rises_**  \nWait, the “Dark” Knight represents Jesus? In some ways, yes.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs in _Superman Returns_, the film begins with the hero character absent. He returns to save Gotham City, which, in case you haven’t noticed by now, never seems to be a very nice place and has plenty of people who [don’t seem worthy of being saved](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+5%3A8&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nThe bad guy, Bane, [tries to paint himself as the good guy](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+11%3A14&version=NIV), and gives a speech [offering people the freedom to do whatever they want](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2%3A18-19&version=NIV)—all the while planning to [destroy them](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10:10&version=NIV). He has a time bomb, and there’s no way to escape the death that it brings.  \n  \n  \n  \nBane breaks Batman’s body, and throws him into [a hole in the ground from which it seems no one can escape](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+27%3A57-66&version=NIV). A pit which one character describes as “hell on earth,” and which is the place Bane himself is from.  \n  \n  \n  \nOf course, Batman does rise, and returns to find that many of the “good guys” are [locked away or hiding out of fear](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+20%3A19&version=NIV). He organizes them to take on Bane’s forces, but still has to deal with the bomb that’s going to kill everyone. He does so by (apparently) taking that burden upon himself and [sacrificing his life so they can live](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A5-8&version=NIV). Of course, we later see that he is still alive, meaning _The Dark Knight Rises_ gives us _two_ metaphors for the resurrection.  \n  \n[![Gandalf Jesus](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Gandalf_White.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Gandalf_White.jpg)  \n  \n**5. _Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_**  \n_Lord of the Rings_ was written by J.R.R. Tokien, who was a close friend of C.S. Lewis. Lewis wrote (among other things) the _Chronicles of Narnia_ series, in which Aslan the lion is a not-at-all-secret representation of Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, it’s not surprising that Tolkien’s work also contains allusions to Christ. In fact, you have more than one character to choose from. Gandalf, in _The Two Towers_, is probably the clearest example.  \n  \n  \n  \nGandalf the Grey is an otherworldly being with supernatural powers. At the start of the movie, he is shown battling a demonic creature from the depths of the earth: a supernatural winged, horned beast made out of shadow and flame. Gandalf [battles its darkness with light](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A5-7&version=NIV), but is dragged down with it into a nearly bottomless abyss, and eventually dies in order to defeat it.  \n  \n  \n  \nHe comes back to life, but now is different: he is Gandalf the White. His own friends [don’t even recognize him at first](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+24%3A13-16&version=NIV). After [healing a possessed man](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+8:16&version=NIV), he leaves for a time while the enemy gathers his forces to attack under cover of darkness. Right when all seems lost, Gandalf returns: [riding a white horse, carrying a sharp sword, and with an army on horseback following him](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+19%3A11-16&version=NIV). He again brings light, [blinding the lovers of darkness](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3:19&version=NIV), and quite easily [defeats the forces of evil](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+19%3A19-21&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nThis list could go on, and include everything from _Gladiator_ and _Harry Potter_ to _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ and _RoboCop_ (the first one, believe it or not). I’m not endorsing any of these movies or suggesting you should watch them, and I’m certainly not saying they are Christian movies. They just happen to echo the most important story: the story of a perfect King who sacrifices everything and dies so that the one He loves can live. So that _you_ can live. Even though you’re not worthy, and could never be worthy, of such love.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo the next time you are watching or reading or listening to a story, and find that it tugs at your heartstrings in an unusually powerful way, consider what story you’re really responding to."},"url":{"en-US":"5-mainstream-movies-that-are-secretly-about-jesus"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/5-mainstream-movies-that-are-secretly-about-jesus/"}}},

He was counter-cultural to an extreme. I mean, the authorities of the time killed the guy, even though He was the opposite of a criminal (instead of hurting or killing people, He healed them and brought them back from the dead).  \n  \n  \n  \nOne of the radical things He said that people took issue with was His stance on divorce and remarriage. One day, when some people asked Him when it was OK for a man to divorce his wife, Jesus responded by saying:  \n  \n  \n  \n_“Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.” – Mark 10:11-12_  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat??? Getting married after being divorced counts as adultery? That doesn’t even compute, unless…unless the divorce didn’t count, and you are therefore still married to your ex.  \n  \n  \n  \nJesus, here and in other verses, was basically saying that marriage is permanent. A bond meant to only end by death. So to remarry after a divorce (when it was still possible to reconcile) would be committing adultery.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Hard to Accept**  \nAfter [touching on this subject at The Porch recently](http://www.watermark.org/media/when-to-break-up-and-when-not-to/2990/), there were a number of strong responses from people who disagreed, or who simply found it to be a hard message and wanted clarification.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s no surprise, considering how prevalent divorce is today. What’s interesting is that Jesus got the same response 2,000 years ago. Like today, many people in Jesus’ time thought that you should be able to get a divorce for literally any and every reason. So Jesus knew this would be a hard teaching to accept; even His disciples responded with “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry” (Matthew 19:10). But Jesus doesn’t shy away from the truth, no matter how hard, and here He was explaining something important about marriage and divorce.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why Not Divorce?**  \nLet’s look at why Jesus would have this stance on divorce.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor starters, and to put it very simply: divorce is not a good thing. Pretty much everyone agrees on this. Sure, many people would argue that in some situations it is the best available option, but if you go back to the wedding day, divorce is a hugely negative outcome that no one would ever want. In fact, the bride and groom specifically vow that it will never happen. So if it does happen, that is a huge hurt that some people feel is even worse than having your spouse die (or, for any kids involved, losing one of their parents).  \n  \n  \n  \nBut what Jesus is saying goes beyond all that. He tells us that marriage is something so much bigger than a license and a honeymoon. It is a sacred act where God unites a man and a woman together in such a way that they become one person. As He explains in Matthew 19:4-6:  \n  \n  \n  \n_“Haven’t you read,” he replied, “that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”_  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Pharisees are asking if it’s _permissible_ to divorce and Jesus responds that it may not even be _possible._ From God’s perspective, it is akin to cutting a person in half, or removing flour from a baked loaf of bread.  \n  \n  \n  \n**God’s Marriage to Us**  \nGod instituted marriage, and its purpose goes beyond what we usually think of it.  \n  \n  \n  \nMarriage was created to be a picture of God’s unending love, pursuit, and covenant with His people ([Ephesians 5:31-32](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A31-32&version=NIV)).  \n  \n  \n  \nSo here’s what that means:  \n  \n  \n  \nWe’ve all cheated on God. When we sin, which for me has been _a lot_, we are seeking happiness somewhere other than God and what He has lovingly provided for us. Any and every sin could be grounds for God to “divorce” us.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut He doesn’t. No matter what we do or how many times we do it, He always offers full forgiveness. He never stops pursuing us and actively loving us. And when Jesus came to earth and willingly died for _our_ sins, He proved that there was literally nothing He wouldn’t do to make this marriage work.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod’s plan for marriage is that there would be no divorce. Not that there would be no divorce because your spouse and your marriage is perfect; _no_ marriage is perfect. Marriage is supposed to last for life _despite_ those problems, as we actively love and pursue and forgive each other the way that God loves us ([1 John 4:19](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4:19)).  \n  \n  \n  \nNow, some of you are bound to be saying “Wait, what if my spouse does…” or “But what about this particular situation? Surely I could, or even should, get a divorce then?” Don’t worry; [we’ll talk about what to do in each of those scenarios in a later post](http://theporch.wpengine.com/divorce-and-reconciliation/).  \n  \n  \n  \nIf divorce is a part of your story, as it is for millions of people, God doesn't love you any less because of it. Please know that there is grace, and we'd love to walk with you through the next steps.  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"jesus-crazy-talk-on-divorce"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/jesus-crazy-talk-on-divorce/"}}},

I didn’t deserve to be there. I know that (no need to say otherwise—I know better). I trust the Lord had me there for a reason, and I know He used relationships I have to get me there. One of the men was Pastor John Piper. I felt foolish answering any questions when his 68 years of wisdom is sitting beside me. John Piper has an uncanny ability to make very powerful statements in very few words. He coined the phrase:  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n“God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.”  \n  \n  \n  \nSimple. Deep. Biblically sound. And mind-blowing.  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n[John Piper shared the message at Watermark](http://www.watermark.org/media/a-tender-word-for-pharisees/2958/) that Sunday. I woke up and rushed through the craziness of getting the kids ready for church. To be clear: Monica did most of that with the help of my in-laws, who were in town. We met up with more of our extended family and off we were—to church. As we got close there was a traffic jam about a mile out. I tried to weave through traffic to get my wife close, but ended up dropping her off a ways out and then parking on the top of a parking garage even farther out.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs I walked to church, I was discouraged by how crazy it felt. The whole routine just felt a little stressful. I walked throughout the lobby and got stopped a few times by folks who had questions or wanted to share some encouragement. I was encouraged, while internally frustrated that I was now missing the singing (Phil Wickham was leading us).  \n  \n  \n  \nI met up with my brother-in-law and his wife. The children’s ministry was full, so my niece couldn’t get in. They had to go listen to the message in an overflow room, so our family was separated. Now late, my in-laws, Monica and I all went inside to find a seat. We were upstairs in the “nose bleeds” and couldn’t find 4 seats together. So we were further separated. Eventually, I found a seat just in time to sing a song or two.  \n  \n  \n  \nThen, John Piper walked out. He was teaching on the Parable of the Prodigal Son. I always resonate with the Prodigal Son, the younger of two brothers in the story. Sin: check. Sex: check. Squandering money: check. Rebellion: check. Eating with pigs—might as well have been. But God saved me. I know my part in the story: I’m the Prodigal.  \n  \n  \n  \nPiper wasn’t teaching about the Prodigal, though; he had zeroed in on the older brother. The one who had taken his father’s house for granted. The one left out on “The Porch,” as Piper continued to point out. The one who had been trying to earn his father’s estate through hard work, and then was left feeling sorry for himself.  \n  \n  \n  \nLook, many people have come up and said, “JP, you were talking directly to me. Did you write that message just for me?” I am always encouraged by that, while also secretly thinking that is a little narcissistic. But this morning, it was like Pastor John was in my head, just messing with me. (The one left out on “[The Porch.](http://theporch.wpengine.com)” Really, John?) I felt the Lord mercifully making me aware that I was the older brother in the story. How did this happen?! Have I become a grumbler? If so, it happened quickly. It just took a little discouragement, a few nights of bad sleep, a couple of busy weeks, and here I am: a grumbler. That was a powerful potion of spiritual death. And now I’ve become an older brother judging the younger brothers around me and disappointed with God. I was undone. The tears started 10 minutes in, and continued in the lobby afterwards.  \n  \n  \n  \nWell, as Piper pointed out, I am glad that the Gospel is not a “Help Wanted” sign, with a God who needs us to do anything. Rather, it is a “Help Available” sign, with a loving Father who has done everything for us. I think I’ll apply inside and remember to trust the One who seeks to give life abundantly. He has provided our every need and is not looking to us to earn anything from Him, but to enjoy His presence in all that we do.  \n  \n  \n  \nPraise God that [our place of worship](http://www.watermark.org) is crowded. I thank Him that I had to walk a measly couple of blocks to get inside. How awesome is that?! I am so grateful that classrooms are full of kids being discipled at early ages. Awesome! I love that His body is full of encouraging words and that His Spirit would speak through me in spite of my failures. That continues to amaze me.  \n  \n  \n  \nI am pathetic, but I am grateful He doesn’t see me that way. That He would graciously entreat me to worship Him in a place full of people He used to radically change my life. I am committed to serving Him the rest of my days. May His Spirit produce fruit in our lives as we lean into Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)"},"url":{"en-US":"i-am-the-older-brother"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/i-am-the-older-brother/"}}},

Hmm. A word I, quite frankly, have hated. Granted, I'm not saying I want to dress provocatively. I've just found the idea so restrictive. Visions of _Little House on the Prairie_ and _Sound of Music_ come to mind as I wrestle with “that word,” and as a passionate woman, educated in the liberal arts, I find myself conflicted when it comes to calling women to plainness.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut when [D-Marv](http://www.watermark.org/about-us/our-team/david-marvin/) defined modesty this way, I couldn't argue. Being modest isn't simply looking “frumpy,” but rather relying on other attributes and qualities as your go-to. There is no need to sacrifice fashion or style for the cause of decency, but rather we, as women, must counter the culture that values our bodies and force it to value our hearts and minds.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Not “Made to Order”**  \nIn college, I took a course on the “Sociology of the Body.” This in-depth class revealed the multitude of ways in which society and its ideologies become embodied, literally. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this study was how drastically women’s bodies have been infiltrated by society. Put simply, we have become what's “ordered.” Tall, thin, tan? Done. Sexy, willing, non-opinionated? Order up! This fast-food version of women has become instantly available by way of the media, and don't even get me started on the influence of pornography.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe superficial has loudly taken center-stage, silencing the honest beauty of real women.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo how does one of these now “chorus girls” grasp the limelight of the lead? By conforming.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe diet. We tone. We tan. We buy. We whiten. We straighten. We hide. We hide behind the mask we find socially acceptable instead of standing firmly in the unique design of ourselves.  \n  \n  \n  \nInstead of getting frustrated looking at Beyonce's Instagrams, Victoria's Secret ads, or practically any commercial/movie/magazine/etc.:  \n  \n  \n  \nLet's turn the tables!  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Body Battle**  \nIn [Matthew 21:12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+21%3A12), Jesus entered the temple and was enraged by how people had violated what He had deemed sacred. So it should be with us. As [1 Corinthians 6:19](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A19+&version=NIV) puts it, our bodies are temples. If we understand this truth, then why are we letting them be used for purposes society deems commonplace and even profitable?  \n  \n  \n  \nWe must call out the impropriety and shine light on the darkness found in our culture. As chosen ones of the King, we cannot cower in our “steeples”; we must wage war. [Ephesians 6:12-17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A12-17&version=NIV) reminds us of the battle we are in. I mean, we are told to put on armor, for goodness sakes! May we recognize that we are in the middle of something serious and let us not remain content with the status quo.  \n  \n  \n  \nLadies, in this “body battle,” seek modesty. May we be intelligent, passionate, loving, joyful, and serving women who take these issues of exploitation head-on. May the gospel be our battle cry. My prayer is that we show our world true femininity.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs someone who has a long history with body image issues and insecurity, let me be the first to say that I recognize how cheesy this may seem. “Be beautiful, that's you!” Although it sounds like a $3.98 Hallmark card your mom gives you on your “once-again” [single Valentines Day](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-spend-valentines-day-if-you-are-single/), it is the truth! How can we cling to Scripture about God's strength, sovereignty, and sacrifice in Jesus and yet throw the Proverbs 31 woman to the way-side, or laugh when we read [1 Peter 3:3-4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A3-4&version=NIV)? Please, Do NOT get hung up on the facade of “The Beauty.” Recognize the precious gift you have in Jesus and get excited when you dwell on the ways in which He can use you to glorify Himself—maybe even starting with breaking the mold of immodesty.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn this “beauty” debate, I refuse to be the woman who waives the white flag of apathy. Rather, I pray that I would root myself in Jesus Christ. That I would recognize my deep need for Him, His unyielding love for me, and that even on days when I fail at this and complain about myself or long to have Kate Upton's legs, I would be reminded of His promises and His intentional design.  \n  \n  \n  \nLet's turn the tables."},"url":{"en-US":"modesty-turning-the-tables"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/modesty-turning-the-tables/"}}},

I didn’t really know what sex was and one internet search resulted in a habit I couldn’t (and didn’t know I needed to) break. My parents found out several months later and quickly put parental controls on our internet to prevent me from visiting those sites again, but the damage had already been done. At 11 years old I had allowed pornography to tell me how to view my body, my relationships, my power over men, and my worth.  \n  \nWhen I was 15, I prayed to accept Christ out of desperation that there had to be more to life than what I was currently experiencing. Romans 10:9-10 says, “That if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” I believed that He died for my sins and that He rose again, but I was not yet ready to let Him be my Savior and Lord over every area of my life.  \n  \n**A Search Ensues**  \nI started dating when I was 16 and didn’t have more than three months of singleness between relationships until I was 22. I consistently sought out men to validate and affirm me. I used my body to attract men and pushed each one towards marriage in the hope of finding security in the permanency of marriage. Physical intimacy kept me in abusive relationships and convinced my heart that “if I just marry this one” then my past choices would be justified. Scripture tells us in Jeremiah 17:9 that “the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure…” but I still trusted my heart and not Christ.  \n  \nI started attending Watermark in the spring of 2011, but it wasn’t until the end of yet another relationship in 2012 that I finally came to the end of myself. I started attending [re:generation (Watermark’s recovery ministry)](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery/) because of the pattern of codependency in my life. Through the love and support of other broken women around me, God revealed that my codependency was a result of the lies that I had believed since I was that 11 year old girl – the lies that I wasn’t pretty enough, that I wasn’t smart enough, that if I did not use my body to manipulate men then I would not be wanted.  \n  \n**A Detour**  \nAs I recognized my struggle to believe that I had value and worth, God was faithful to use the incredible women in my life to consistently pray for me and breathe truth into my life. They modeled the unfading beauty of [1 Peter 3:3-4](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A3-4&version=NIV). And they reminded me that I am a precious [daughter of the King](http://theporch.wpengine.com/daughter-of-the-king/), co-heir to the throne. It didn’t matter if I wasn’t pretty enough or smart enough or pure enough; Jesus is enough.  \n  \nWhen I finally surrendered _all_ of my life to Christ, I found healing. He gave me joy and peace that I can’t even describe in words.  \n  \nToday, I am surrendering my struggle to find my worth in anything but Christ. Today, I am choosing to believe the promises of Romans 8:38-39 that nothing can separate me from the love of Christ and that in him I am free from my past sins and destructive habits. Today, I am standing firm in Galatians 5:1: “It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.”  \n  \nToday, I am redeemed, I am loved, and I am FREE!  \n  \n  \n  \n_[What's your story](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-your-story/)?

And it even seems to be biblical, as Jesus Himself said “Do not judge, or you too will be judged” in Matthew 7:1. It’s one bit of Scripture that even non-Christians often have memorized, as it seems to give people a “get out of jail free” card whenever anyone wants to suggest that they’re wrong.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut does it, really?  \n  \n  \n  \nThere’s a lot of confusion surrounding that verse and the overall concept of “judge not.” To use another popular quote: “I do not think it means what you think it means.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**What Judging Means**  \nFor starters, I sometimes hear people object to judgment when there’s actually no judging going on.  \n  \n  \n  \nAccording to the dictionary, the verb “judge” means either “to pass sentence on,” “to form an opinion of,” or “to conclude about.” So, for example, if I were to say that people who smoke are 15-30 times more likely to get lung cancer than people who don’t smoke, all I’m doing is [citing a statistic](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/lung/basic_info/risk_factors.htm). If you do smoke, I’m not sentencing you to lung cancer, or concluding that you will get it. Within that statement, I’m not even necessarily saying it’s wrong to smoke. So if a smoker were to read that and feel like they’re being judged, ironically, the judgment is coming from them. They’re uncomfortable because they are coming to the conclusion that smoking is somehow wrong, and that they are harming themselves with it.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Judging and Love**  \nLet’s stick with that example for a moment. Many people seem to equate judging with hate, and it’s true that Christians are [called to love even our enemies](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A43-47&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nBut let’s say that, hypothetically, I knew two people who were both heavy smokers. And one of those people I actually did hate, strongly, while the other person I loved very much.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat would I say to the person I loved about their smoking habit? Well, I’d probably tell them the truth: that they are 15-30 times more likely to get lung cancer. Furthermore, I’d probably ask them to quit, and offer to help them break the habit in any way I could. I’d say that because I love them, and don’t want anything bad to happen to them.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd the person I (hypothetically) hated? Would I judge them about the dangers of smoking? No. I wouldn’t want to warn them. I might even buy them an extra pack, if I really wanted to be cruel.  \n  \n  \n  \nAgain, as a Christ-follower, I should obviously never try to harm someone. So the Christian response should be to lovingly point out the dangers, not to just ignore it (and definitely not encourage it!).  \n  \n  \n  \n**What “Do Not Judge” Means**  \nBut what about Matthew 7:1? What did Jesus mean?  \n  \n  \n  \nTodd Wagner [goes quite in-depth on that verse here](http://www.watermark.org/media/the-most-misunderstood-verse-in-your-bible-part-1/218/), and gives even more detail in [part 2 here](http://www.watermark.org/media/the-most-misunderstood-verse-in-your-bible-part-2/219/). Besides that, here are a few notes on what it does and does not mean:\n\n  \n- First off, remember the different definitions of “judge.” It’s clear that Jesus isn’t saying we cannot form opinions or come to conclusions based on evidence, because in the same chapter He repeatedly asks us to do exactly that. See [Matthew 7:15-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A15-20&version=NIV), for example, where He says to judge (tell the difference between) true and false teachings based on the evidence of their “fruit.” See also [Luke 7:43](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A15-20&version=NIV), where He commends someone on “judging correctly” based on this definition. Bottom line, Jesus asks us to judge.\n  \n- As with anything (biblical or otherwise), context is important. [Read not just Matthew 7:1, but 7:1-5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7%3A1-5&version=NIV). (Actually, read all of Matthew. And then Mark, Luke, and John.) In Matthew 7, Jesus is talking about not being a hypocrite and faulting someone for something that you yourself do. He actually says you _should_ “remove the speck from your brother’s eye,” but only after removing the plank from your own eye.\n  \n- The verses above also do not say you can’t speak against a problem if you’ve been a part of that same problem in the past. It’s not like you can’t tell a toddler not to touch a hot stove just because you burned yourself as a child. On the contrary, once you’ve overcome a problem in your own life, that makes you more qualified to speak about it and help others find freedom from it.\n  \n- [1 Corinthians 5:12-6:6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+5%3A12-6%3A6&version=NIV) actually calls us to judge matters between fellow believers—our brothers and sisters in Christ. And that includes the “pass sentence on,” court type of judgment.\n  \n- Within those verses (1 Corinthians 5:12-13), it does say that we are not to judge (pass sentence on) unbelievers. In other words, we’re not the ones who decide whether someone is going to heaven or not. God decides that. We are, however, supposed to [speak the truth in love](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:15) and [share the good news of how they can be saved](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A15-16&version=NIV). Telling someone the gospel isn’t judging; it’s loving.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nThere is one final point on judging, which is far more important than anything else I’ve said. Though we don’t determine who does or does not have eternal life, there is One who does. The standard for this judgment is [perfection](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:48&version=NIV), which [none of us live up to](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=all+have+sinned&qs_version=NIV). Statistically you’re either 100% going to heaven or 100% not; you can’t beat the odds in this one area.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo if you really want to avoid judgment, there is one way. To quote Jesus again:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. – John 5:24_  \n  \nThat’s good news.  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)"},"url":{"en-US":"judge-not"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/judge-not/"}}},

He noted to me that most people seemed to assume they were living together, and that’s why he was helping her move. At least one person even expressed shock and confusion that they _weren’t_ living together, and would not be until after the wedding.  \n  \n  \n  \nTheir reactions might be a little bit disheartening, but they were not surprising. Depending on which stat you look at, about two-thirds of young adults now live together before marriage. What would have been a foreign concept a couple of generations ago is now more or less the norm.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Christians Living Together**  \nIf you’re not a follower of Christ, then the fact that you may be cohabitating with someone you are dating is not a surprise. This post isn’t really even for you, because any attempt to change your _behavior_ will do nothing to change your _belief_. Whether or not you are living together before marriage is nowhere near as important as where you will be living for eternity. That’s my primary concern for you.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut if you do call yourself Christians, and you are living together, then you are not fully letting the Lord be Lord over your life. And that’s problematic because the things God calls us to, He does for our own good.  \n  \n  \n  \n**“Living” Together**  \nLet’s start with the obvious. For Christ-followers, the first problem with living together outside of marriage is that it usually means you are having [sex together outside of marriage](http://realtruthrealquick.com/christian-premarital-sexual-realtionship/). I know that’s extremely common today—it’s definitely a major part of my past—but it’s not God’s design. As radical as it might sound to some people today, God designed marriage and sex to be kind of inseparable. [In the Old Testament](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+22%3A16-17&version=NIV), if two single people slept together, they _had_ to get married unless the woman’s father forbade it. And when [Jesus talked about how marriage is two people becoming “one flesh,”](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10:7-9&version=NIV) you don’t have to think too hard to figure out what He’s talking about.  \n  \n  \n  \nI could definitely go on here, but technically I already have. So, for more details, please check out:\n\n  \n- [Why premarital sex is a sin](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/)\n  \n- [Why premarital sex is a bad idea](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/)\n  \n  \n  \n  \nAs that second link points out, sex creates a bond between two people. That makes perfect sense if it is designed for marriage, where you are already fully committed to staying together. But if you're just living together, you have no true commitment; you’re actually avoiding true commitment, because you could have just gotten married first. So that bond then works against you: it can keep you in a bad relationship longer, and when you do break up, the pain is much worse because of it.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Breaking Up**  \nThat’s the other big problem with cohabitating: it typically doesn’t work.  \n  \n  \n  \nPeople often justify it as a realistic trial for marriage. That by living together before marriage, you can see for certain whether marriage would work. That line of reasoning sounds persuasive, but it has one major flaw: it doesn’t work out that way.  \n  \n  \n  \nStudies have shown for years that people who live together before marriage are actually more likely to [divorce](http://theporch.wpengine.com/jesus-crazy-talk-on-divorce/) after marriage. [Such studies](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-the-name-love/201303/does-cohabitation-lead-more-divorces) also show that married couples who live together first have less marital happiness, poorer communication, and higher levels of abuse. Statistics vary in terms of how big this “cohabitation effect” is, and some try to downplay its importance, but it would be very difficult to find a single article that shows that the outcome is better if you live together first.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut that’s just the ones that make it to marriage. Roughly half of all people who live together break up before marriage, with many of the same hurts and complications that come with a divorce. Since about half of those who get married also get divorced, that’s about a 75% failure rate for these “trial marriages.” Who wants to sign up for those odds?  \n  \n  \n  \n**What if we’re not having sex?**  \nThis is an interesting question that came up during our [“Battle of the Sexes” Q & A.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/battle-of-the-sexes-q-a/) Is it OK to live with someone you are dating if you do wait until marriage to have sex?  \n  \n  \n  \nThere are at least three problems with that:  \n\n  \n- One, you’re unnecessarily setting yourself up for temptation. It’s like you want the maximum temptation possible, even though your goal is not to give in.\n  \n- It’s not natural. You are training yourself to live with this person and not have sex. So, if or when you do get married, you’ll be really good at living together but not having sex. It’s just not a good habit to get into, and can be a hard switch to flip.\n  \n- Most outsiders will naturally assume that you are having sex. So you’re not living above reproach, [as the Bible says to do](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+2%3A15&version=NIV), and you’re missing out on a chance to witness to a world that desperately needs some good examples of how to live wisely and marry well.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n**What if we’re already engaged?**  \nThis question is one of the most confusing to me. Why would two Christians live together if they are already engaged?  \n  \n  \n  \nFollow the logic here. You’ve already decided to get married. You don’t want to wait to start living together as a couple. So why don’t you just get married already? It solves both problems at once. (And yes, I can [back that up with Scripture](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7%3A9&version=NIV).)  \n  \n  \n  \nGod doesn’t command you to have a big wedding that takes months or years to plan. He does want you to wait until marriage before living as though you were married. If you are going to compromise somewhere, compromise on the one-time party that lasts just a few hours—not on the lifelong adventure that is marriage.  \n  \n  \n  \nEither you’re ready to get married, or you’re not. If you are: get married. If you’re not, the last thing you should be doing is living together as though you were married.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Grace Abounds**  \nIf you are living together: you’re not doomed. God’s love isn’t dependent on your actions or behavior. But He wants what’s best for you. Cohabitation is not God’s best, and it’s rarely anyone’s idea of what’s best; it is always a compromise.  \n  \n  \n  \nDon’t compromise; [you’re worth more than that](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+31:10&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1jy2YfJHKqyQA62G4KiyMy"}}},"url":{"en-US":"why-not-live-together"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-not-live-together/"}}},

Marriage is permanent, so getting married to someone else after a divorce could be considered adultery. The goal should be to reconcile with your one spouse when possible.  \n  \nBut, you may say, what about when there is abuse? Adultery? Abandonment? What if you get divorced and _then_ become a believer—are you supposed to go back to your unbelieving ex? There are many difficult scenarios that might cause someone to consider divorce, and I feel for anyone who has endured them. Let’s look at some of these painful scenarios and consider what Scripture would have us do.  \n  \n**What about when there is abuse?**  \nIf your spouse is abusive, it’s often best to create physical (geographic) separation, with the support of other Christians and lots of prayer for your spouse to change. God does not want you facing violence from a spouse, but God’s best would ultimately be to change the heart of your spouse and give you a restored marriage that honors Him.  \n  \nWhen we talk about “pursuing reconciliation,” in extreme circumstances that can look like safely separating and beginning to pray for God to save your spouse. It does not mean moving back into a violent situation.  \n  \nWe have seen God change the hardest and most wicked of hearts. I know that in these circumstances it can seem like it’s impossible that they will ever change. But Jesus said that “What is impossible with man is possible with God” (Luke 18:27).  \n  \n**What if one spouse is not a Christian? Or one becomes a Christian after divorce?**  \nThis common but very difficult situation is why we teach single Christians to only date people who love Jesus ([2 Corinthians 6:14](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+6%3A14&version=NIV)). However, if you are already in a marriage where only one person is a Christian these verses apply:  \n  \n_If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. – 1 Corinthians 7:12b-13_  \n  \n_Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. – 1 Peter 3:1-2_  \n  \nGod’s heart is for everyone to know Him. Your relationship (or lack thereof) with God has eternal consequences, which outweigh even a lifelong commitment like marriage. God may use the faith of one spouse to show His own love for that person and awaken their faith. Pray for your spouse, and attempt to show the love you have been shown. This will be difficult, and requires walking in dependence on Christ, His people, and His Spirit.  \n  \n**What if one spouse abandons the other?**  \n_But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so. The brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. – 1 Corinthians 7:15_  \n  \nThis is a debated verse. Does it mean the abandoned, believing spouse is free to marry someone else? I don’t know. I do know God’s best would be reconciliation between the husband and wife, and reconciliation between the estranged spouse and God. It’s also clear that God has called you to peace. Would you consider praying for your spouse?  \n  \n**What about when there is adultery?**  \n_I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery. – Matthew 19:9_  \n  \nDoes Jesus give an “out” in Matthew 19:9 for spouses who have been cheated on? Some believe that yes, He does. But others believe that Jesus was referring only to adultery during the betrothal period, _before_ marriage.  \n  \nSee, in Jewish culture, breaking off a betrothal or engagement required actually getting a divorce. The only circumstance where such a broken engagement was allowed was if you discovered your fiancé was “sexually immoral” or had committed “pornea” (the word Jesus uses here). It is interesting that Jesus uses the word for sexual immorality and not the word for adultery in marriage, which appears later in the verse. It is also worth noting that Matthew was written to a Jewish audience who would have known about the betrothal period, whereas [Mark](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10%3A11-12&version=NIV) and [Luke](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+16%3A18&version=NIV), which were written to a different audience, did not include this exception clause when relaying the same story. For a fuller explanation, you can [podcast the message we did on the subject](http://www.watermark.org/media/when-to-break-up-and-when-not-to/2990/).  \n  \nEither way, though, both sides of that debate generally agree that reconciliation is always preferred to divorce. Adultery is terrible and painful. If this is apart of your story it will take time and work for healing to take place on both sides. But our God is bigger than adultery, and we have seen Him time and again take marriages with this painful past and bring them to full restoration. Would you consider praying for God to work in your heart and your spouse’s heart to bring healing and restoration?  \n  \n**A final word:**  \nThis topic is difficult and highly debated. But what’s not up for debate is this: God loves you. He is crazy about you. He wants to give you life. Whether you are single, married, divorced or somewhere in-between, He loves you. He never planned for divorce; in fact He says He hates it. But He doesn’t hate the divorced person. He loves them.  \n  \nIt might sound like Jesus is idealistic when He talks about marriage and divorce. But remember who He is. Jesus is in the business of changing lives, and there is nothing He can’t do. If your situation seems impossible, He’s exactly the One you need to turn to.  \n  \nIf you have been through a divorce and need to process through this more, we’d love to help.

They have their Bible, and perhaps they’ve memorized some Scriptures, and they appear to be really holy. But it’s a show—a play—and you’re the one being played.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’m talking about “posers” within the Church. In a world of online dating and social media profiles, where you can have [thousands of “friends” and no one who truly knows you](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-lonely-generation/), it seems a lot more people are able to pretend to be something they’re not. And that certainly includes people within the Church, especially in a place like Dallas or a large body like [Watermark](http://www.watermark.org).  \n  \n  \n  \nBut posers within the Church aren’t really a new thing. Though they didn’t use the term back then, they were present even in the early days, when the New Testament was still being written. Paul talks at length about these pretenders, who were taking advantage of women, in [2 Timothy 3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \n**What is a Christian Poser?**  \nTo be clear, I’m not talking about someone who says they are an unbeliever, or is openly curious about the faith—we’re happy to have you here.  \n  \n  \n  \nRather, I’m talking about someone who claims to be following Christ but actually is not. Someone who is intentionally trying to deceive others. People who look like Christians and strategically act like Christians so they can betray you and take advantage of you—purposefully.  \n  \n  \n  \nThese are players who are not really interested in God unless knowledge of Him gives them a chance with you.  \n  \n  \n  \nTo keep from getting played, you need to be able to identify them.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Characteristics of a Poser**  \nAs discussed last week, 2 Timothy 3 includes a list of characteristics you can use to identify [posers in the Church](http://www.watermark.org/media/posers-in-the-church/3059/). These predators are marked by being:\n\n  \n- **Lovers of themselves.** They are selfish and narcissistic.\n  \n- **Lovers of money.** Money is an idol. It’s a primary goal of their life.\n  \n- **Boastful and proud.** They walk around telling you things that they excel at. Worldly success is an idol.\n  \n- **Abusive.** They hurt people physically or with their words.\n  \n- **Disobedient to their parents.** This basically shows they struggle with authority. If you call Jesus “Lord,” He is your authority.\n  \n- **Ungrateful.** Believers understand that they have received [amazing grace](http://theporch.wpengine.com/amazing-grace-lyrical-theology/) that they don’t deserve. Posers feel that they are entitled.\n  \n- **Unholy.** They are not set apart from the world. They want to be loved by Dallas more than Jesus.\n  \n- **Without love.** See [1 John 4:8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John+4:8&version=NIV).\n  \n- **Unforgiving.** They harbor bitterness. They don’t forgive because they don’t understand how they’ve been forgiven.\n  \n- **Slanderous.** They speak evil of others, almost for sport. They love to tear others apart. The word here literally translates “devil,” because [the devil is the accuser](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12%3A9-10&version=NIV). That’s what he does. The devil accuses; Jesus forgives.\n  \n- **Without self-control.** They just want to do what feels good, regardless of its effects on themselves or others.\n  \n- **Brutal.** As in, untamed or uncivilized. They aren’t yielded to the Spirit of God.\n  \n- **Not lovers of good.** They don’t seek to do good.\n  \n- **Treacherous.** They don’t keep their word. They always keep their options open in case something (or someone) better comes along.\n  \n- **Rash.** They’re not considerate of others.\n  \n- **Conceited.** They are confident in their worldly abilities or possessions rather than confident in God.\n  \n- **Lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.** These are people who view God as their sugar daddy. They don’t want God; they just want His stuff.\n  \n- **Having a form of godliness but denying its power.** They strategically appear to look like a Christian, but they are not saved and therefore do not have the Holy Spirit in them.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n**Avoiding Posers**  \nMost all believers will identify with some of the things on this list. But I’m not talking about if you _used to be_ a lover of pleasure, or abusive, or slanderous. Or, if you are _momentarily_ conceited, or _momentarily_ rash. All of us make mistakes at times. Paul is talking specifically about people in the church who have given themselves over to these things, and whose lives are marked or defined by them.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnyone can be any of these things momentarily. However, anyone can also _hide_ these things momentarily, which means you cannot spot these people right off the bat.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, be smart when [choosing who to date](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-should-i-date/). Get to know the person. Get to know other people who know that person well—particularly those who are in [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/) with them—because it will be much harder for them to fool multiple people over a longer period of time. If they are not in community and there is nobody trustworthy willing to vouch for them, that is an _extremely_ bad sign.  \n  \n  \n  \nRemember, the only reason these people would even be in a church is because they are looking for prey. Don’t be their prey.  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)"},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-spot-a-poser"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-spot-a-poser/"}}},

Our young adults crowd of twenty- and thirty-somethings are mostly single, and though there are a good number of single moms on Tuesday nights, most women there are not mothers. However, I’d venture a guess that the majority of those women _do_ want to be mothers at some point in the future—some of them very strongly so.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis message is for you, the hopefully-someday-future-<wbr></wbr>mothers.  \n  \n  \n  \n**You Are, Right Now, Becoming Something**  \nMotherhood is important. It’s probably the most important job you’ll ever have. There’s a reason why Mother’s Day is a holiday, and why it gets so much more attention than President’s Day or Earth Day or—let’s be honest—Father’s Day. Mothers have such a huge influence on the lives of just about everyone. Hopefully that influence is good, but bad moms are also a reality in this fallen world.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you’re sitting there dreaming of becoming a mom someday, it’s a safe bet that you’re dreaming of being a _good_ mother. One with happy children, who grow up to be happy and well-adjusted adults who spend every Mother’s Day singing your praises.  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, good mothers don’t just happen. It’s not just something that automatically occurs whenever you give birth (or adopt). It’s the result of a lifelong process—one you have already started. You’re either in the process of becoming a good mother right now—or you’re not.  \n  \n  \n  \nAgain, I bring it up just because it’s such an important job. The world needs good mothers. I’d like for you to be a great mother someday, if that’s what you want to be. But what you’re doing right now has a big influence on what kind of mom you’ll be.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How to Become a Good Mother**  \nSo what should you be doing, if that’s your goal? Some thoughts:\n\n  \n- **Be in the Word.** It’s emphasized among Watermark church staff that our most important ministry is at home. Pastors might reach a lot of people with a sermon during one hour a week, but that doesn’t compare to the influence that parents have raising their children 24/7/365 for the first 18 years of their lives. As my pastor Todd Wagner has often pointed out, his current ministry is only possible because of the time he spent learning and studying the Bible as a young adult, before he had kids and the responsibility of leading a church to take up his time. You, likewise, have way more time now as a single person without kids then you ever will again (or at least until the kids are grown and it’s already too late). See [Deuteronomy 11:18-19](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+11%3A18-19&version=NIV). Good moms spend time in God’s Word.\n  \n- **Practice patience.** Children require a lot of patience, trust me! So be patient now as you wait and date and make choices that will affect you long-term. A great way to love your future children now is to not compromise or take shortcuts. Good moms model patience in how they trust God.\n  \n- **Be wise with money.** Yeah, so children also require money, from conception through college. So live below your means now, and build good financial habits. Good moms honor God with their stewardship of His resources.\n  \n- **Be healthy.** This is important, but is a tricky one to include. Because “healthy” is not synonymous with “thin,” and the things some people do to chase having that “ideal” body are not healthy at all. Plus, if that’s your idol, you’re going to have a hard time with the reality of having kids. What you can do instead is to have a healthy body image, develop healthy habits, and avoid or overcome habits that could be harmful to a baby (like smoking, drugs, or alcohol addiction). [As I’ve said before](http://www.watermark.org/media/dating-on-target/2432), men don’t need trophy wives; we need women to go to war with us! Good moms take care of themselves.\n  \n- **Choose a good father.** I’ve heard it said that a woman should only marry someone if they’d be happy having a son who is exactly like him—because that’s what you’re going to get, more or less. Check out this [list of things to look for in a man](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-woman-should-look-for-in-a-man/). Good moms hold out for men who are becoming good fathers.\n  \n- **Get experience.** You don’t necessarily have to have kids to reproduce yourself. There are many kids missing a parent, or just generally in tough situations, who would benefit a great deal from you pouring into them. You could mentor a child through [Mercy Street](http://mercystreetdallas.org/), for instance, or shepherd a whole flock of kids through [Watermark student ministries](http://www.morewake.com/). There are also many [single parents](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/single-parent-family-ministry/) who could use your help.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \nOne final thing to mention: I’ve seen children become an idol to some people, both among those who have children and those who wish they did. What I mean is that children become the ultimate, most important thing in life, ahead of even God. Now, the desire for things like marriage and children is a good thing. It is in no way wrong to have those desires. But if you require those things for fulfillment, ignore God’s commands in order to get them, or reject God because you haven’t gotten exactly what you want—that’s a problem.  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \nGod doesn’t guarantee us marriage, children, or (insert idol here). He doesn’t promise us that life on earth will be a fairy tale. In fact, [He specifically promises that we’ll have trouble in this life](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:33&version=NIV). And the reason why we can have peace and joy in spite of that is because [He has also promised that this life isn’t all there is](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5:24&version=NIV). Regardless of whatever troubles you face or will face in the future, by trusting in Him you get heaven with Him in the end. So trust, and wait. But make good use of your time while you’re waiting by becoming what you hope to be.  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)"},"url":{"en-US":"letter-to-future-mothers"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/letter-to-future-mothers/"}}},

He died for your sins, we know that, but why is it so important that He was raised from the dead? On Easter Sunday I was in a room full of churchgoers and I asked that very question. Sadly, the answer was a mystery to many.  \n  \nDo you know the answer? You have probably celebrated Easter much of your life, but do you know [why Easter](http://theporch.wpengine.com/losing-my-religion/), the day we celebrate Jesus’ resurrection, really matters?  \n  \n**GOD IS POWERFUL**\n\n1. The resurrection is a display of God’s power. I love the taunting nature of [1 Corinthians 15:55-57](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+15%3A55-57&version=NIV). God is all-powerful. If death can’t stop Him then nothing can. Far too often Christians see God and Satan as dueling rivals. This is bad theology. God is the God of even Satan, The Accuser. God has power over him too and Satan operates within the boundaries that God allows. Satan is no match for God — not even close, and he knows it. If death is Satan’s victory, God has the power to overturn that victory.\n\n  \n**WE HAVE HOPE**  \n\n2. The resurrection gives us hope. The fact that God has power over death serves as a reminder that something happens to us after we die, and if we trust in the provision from The One who has power over death, we have hope for eternal life. He wrote a check for us on the cross, paying for all of our sins so that we don’t have to. At the resurrection, the \"check cleared\". His payment for our sins was good and we are saved from the eternal consequence of sin if we believe that. [Romans 10:9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+10%3A9&version=NIV).\n\n  \n**WE HAVE GUIDANCE**  \n\n3. The resurrection allows for Jesus to direct us toward righteousness here on Earth. We do not worship a dead God, but One who is alive and active in our lives. He lives and He guides us. Paul writes in [Galatians 2:20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+2%3A20&version=NIV) that it is not he who lives but Christ who lives in Him. In Acts we see that in Him we live and move and have our being. This is why we talk so much about dependence. We don’t have a sin problem; we have a dependence problem. If Jesus is driving, we’re not sinning.\n\n  \n**WE HAVE A MEDIATOR**  \n\n4. The resurrection allows for Jesus to be our Mediator. This is really good news. [Hebrews 7:25](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+7%3A25&version=NIV) says that Jesus can save us because He lives to intercede for us. Satan is constantly telling God how you are guilty. He takes your sins and tries to hold you as a guilty hostage. Jesus, however, serves as a reminder that those sins have been paid for. He hushes the accuser's accusations and declares us righteous by His payment. Satan says \"guilty\"; Jesus says \"sentence served, **FREE**!\"\n\n  \nOur God is not dead. He is alive! He has displayed His power over death. He gives us hope for eternal life. He guides us in this life. And, He declares us righteous against the enemy’s accusations. **How will you live for Him today?**  \n  \n- JP"},"url":{"en-US":"resurrection"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/resurrection/"}}},

In the first few pages of our Bible we see people turning leaves into clothes (Genesis 3:7), turning wood into arks (Genesis 6), and turning bricks into towers (Genesis 11). These are all very basic examples of using technology.  \n  \n  \n  \nOf course, when people today talk about technology, they’re typically referring to digital technology (something that has to be turned on or plugged in). In the course of doing ministry I have heard countless stories of people using digital technology to do great things, as well as destructive ones.  \n  \n  \n  \nSince most of us are constantly using some form of technology from the time we wake up to the time we fall asleep, I thought I would give you a few tips to help you use technology, instead of technology using you.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How Technology Uses You**  \nTechnology is a gift given to us from God, and like many of God’s gifts, we often choose to use it for evil instead of good. Instead of using technology for its God-intended purpose, it uses us as a pawn and causes pain to our heart, soul, and mind. Here are a few examples of how technology uses us:  \n\n  \n- **When we use the web to watch porn or look at pornographic images.** This is an obvious one, but one that seems to really get a grip on lots of folks. It doesn’t even have to be a pornographic site: Netflix, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc., can all cause problems for some people. If something in any of those places causes you to stumble, [get rid of it](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-overcome-a-pornography-addiction/). Quick!\n  \n- **When we use the web to lust after anything we don’t have.** There are a lot of subtle ways we do this. It could be spending hours on Pinterest thinking how much happier we would be if we had that “awesome” new bathroom, kitchen, or “dream wedding”; looking at our friend’s Facebook feed and thinking how much better life would be if we could go on a vacation like (fill in the blank with one of your Facebook friends) went on or had a boyfriend/girlfriend like they have; or spending hours on Zillow thinking about a way to afford that dream home (that we think we need or deserve in our 20s or 30s). For some people Ikea.com can cause them to lust just as much as a porn website. The bottom line is this: if looking at anything online causes you to stumble or becomes an idol of worship to you, it’s technology using you, and it’s wicked. Don’t let Satan play you for a fool.\n  \n- **When we use technology to get ahead of God.** One of the most common pieces of advice I give my single friends it to move slowly in relationships and guard their hearts. I remember staying up all night and “falling in love” with girls in my teens and early twenties because I talked to them all night on the phone or instant messenger. I rushed things that God didn’t me to rush into. Go slow. Don’t spend all night talking to someone you just met on Facebook messenger or text message.\n  \n  \n**Ways to Use Technology to Win!**  \nI could go on forever about the ways I’ve seen God use technology to change people’s lives and to do good in the world. Many of these will be obvious to you, but I thought I would list out a few examples:  \n\n  \n- **Grow in your faith.** Today we have access to a treasure never before seen in the history of the world: a virtually unlimited library of free resources to help people grow and mature in their faith! There are websites, podcasts, apps, live streams, commentaries, and online Bibles. We live in a time where you can learn and grow as a Christian as you commute to work, brush your teeth, go on a run, or ride in an airplane. There are many great resources; below are just a few of my favorites:  \n\n  \n  - [The Porch App](http://get.theapp.co/a1a2). In this brand new app you’ll have access to keep up to date with everything going on at The Porch (the young adult ministry of Watermark Church), access the entire achieve of talks, and connect with them on social media!\n  \n  - [Real Truth. Real Quick.](http://realtruthrealquick.com) Have you ever had a question about the faith, but were afraid to ask? [In this app](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/real-truth.-real-quick./id818710236?mt=8) we answer your questions on life, leadership, and the world around us in 5 minutes or less. (Or at least we try…some of them take a few minutes longer!)\n  \n  - [GotQuestions.org.](http://www.gotquestions.org) A free resource with a fantastic searchable database that answers some of the toughest theological questions out there in an easy-to-understand way.\n  \n  - [SonicLight.org](http://soniclight.org). Another great resource that gives you access to free downloadable commentaries on every book of the Bible!\n  \n  \n  \n- **Create awareness and share your faith.** Digital Technology has given each of us a worldwide platform at our fingertips. We can use hashtags to create awareness about causes, [use social media to give testimony](http://theporch.wpengine.com/mystory-2/) to what God is doing in our lives, create [blogs to bring attention to important causes](http://noahsdad.com/mothers-womb/), or create a [YouTube channel to share Biblical truth](https://www.youtube.com/user/porchdallas). It’s a great power to be used responsibly.\n  \n- **Enjoy it!** God gives us many gifts that are simply for us to enjoy, and I believe digital technology can be used simply for our enjoyment as well. I don’t think God has any problem with us playing a quick came of Words With Friends while using the bathroom (hey, I’m just being honest!), enjoying a movie with our friends (and it doesn’t even have to be The Passion of Christ!), or Facetiming with our parents who live out of town. Of course, all of those things can be abused and cause us to be distracted, but in moderation I think they are all gifts given from the Gift Giver for us to enjoy.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nTechnology, especially digital technology, can harm or help; give glory or bring destruction. We can use it, or it can use us. But if we are wise, we can use the gift of digital technology that God has given us to change the world, make an impact, grow in our faith, and have a little fun!  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat are some of your favorite uses of digital technology (i.e.: some of your favorite apps, favorite websites, or favorite movies to watch with your friends)?

Usually signifying the start of something new. The beginnings of an uncharted adventure. The vulnerable moment when we dare to dream of something that is yet to be.  \n  \n**What if?**  \nMen and women who have gone before us pondered their own “what if” and the world has changed because of it. In the 1300s John Wycliffe and John Hus died for their “what if” as they were persecuted for translating the Bible so the common man could have access. Martin Luther nailed his paradigm-shifting “what if” to a large wooden door in 1517. And just 14 years ago 8 families asked “what if” as they dreamed of a church that could be something more. Because of these “what ifs,\" you and I are now a [part of a church](http://watermark.org) where Bibles are openly read, grace is freely declared, and we are exhorted to follow Christ rather than appease Him. Their “what if” dreams have since turned into our realities and you and I get to thank those who have gone before for daring to ask.  \n  \nSo now as 20- and 30-year-olds, it’s our turn. As we stand on the shoulders of the[giants who have gone before, poised to peer down the path just a little further](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3%3A10&version=NIV), what will it be that our generation dares to ask? What “what if” will we champion?  \n  \n**Can we pull it off?**  \nBut before we get ahead of ourselves, it’s worth asking if we’re up to the challenge. The world has a lot to say about our age group and[it isn’t always pretty](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/270/). We’ve been deemed the social justice generation and in an odd twist, it’s now glamorous to serve, admirable to give, and trendy to leave it all behind and pursue “spirituality” in the third world. But at the same time we’re a generation criticized for entitlement, lack of follow-through, and failure to commit. It’s a dangerous combination; often resulting in easily-motivated crowds, but poorly-mobilized individuals. If our age group's actions matched our social media fervor, I’d dare to say our cities would look a whole lot different.  \n  \nAnd if we are honest with ourselves, these shortcomings can be just as true of those of us called “the Church” as those who don’t know our Savior. Hosting and attending big events are right up our alley. But unfortunately, committing to long-term relational ministry is not.  \n  \nAnd here’s where this blog post becomes personal, because we just spent an entire month planning and hosting big events with the intention of [changing our city](http://theporch.wpengine.com/making-a-difference-in-dallas-whats-next/) for the better. Was it in vain? I don’t believe so, or I wouldn’t have been a part of it. But a jam-packed April is not enough on its own to change a community. The reality is that if those group events are to carry any impact, we individuals must be committed to a long-term investment. So knowing how our generation tends to lean, how do we make sure that our big moments from April don’t just remain as big moments in April?  \n  \n**Lay it all down so we can rise up.**  \nIf it feels like I just rained all over our parade, it’s because I did. But not without reason; there’s good news for those of us who know Jesus. Yes, even as we dream of what our generation’s “what if” might be,[the gospel is where we must start](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3%3A11&version=NIV). You see, the great freedom of Christianity is that it’s ok to admit we have shortcomings. The great tragedy would be if we pretended we did not.  \n  \nWe have a Jesus who loves us despite our failures and a Holy Spirit who promises not to leave us where He found us. What a loss it would be if His Church, our generation specifically, bought into the lie that we could save the world on our own. What a missed opportunity it would be to ignore our shortcomings and tell our God He didn’t need to show up.  \n  \nSo it’s ok to admit our parade isn’t really all that impressive anyways. Because God isn’t asking for a[puffed up social justice movement](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3%3A12-13&version=NIV), He’s asking us to lay our lives down. He’s calling us to sacrifice our lives, not a Saturday. He’s inviting His people, who know Him by name, to humbly seek His face as[HE (not we) changes a city](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Chron+7%3A14&version=NIV).  \n  \nI don’t know about you, but I believe He can do it. And I believe that despite our shortcomings He just might do it through us. But I also believe it’s going to be hard and require us to depend on Him greatly, just as our predecessors did. So as we commit to laying our lives down we must also ask for God to breathe new life into them, re-teaching us how to be a part of something bigger than ourselves.  \n  \nAs our peers continue to search for worth in their ability to make an impact, may our identities be so rooted in Jesus that we are[free from that striving](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3%3A14&version=NIV). May we be free to replace short-term service for long-term discipleship commitments. Free to serve our city even when Twitter isn’t looking. Free to continue loving when we don’t receive the gratitude we want. Free to listen to the needs of our neighbors rather than our own intuition. Free to[persevere](http://www.watermark.org/media/finish-strong/3078/) when our flesh tells us to give up, choose the easy route, or remain comfortable where we’re at.  \n  \nSo here’s the big “what if,” Church. What if we rise to the occasion? What if we set our sights higher than an event or two? What if we choose to let Him lead as we dare to actually do something? What if we find our identity in Him and step into the roles He created for us to fill? What if our generation reminds the world what His Church was meant to be?  \n  \n_ **What if it changes everything?** _"},"url":{"en-US":"what-if"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-if/"}}},

They _expect_ to be great. In fact, 96% believe they will do something great with their lives.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut 96% can’t really be great. I mean, that’s pretty much everyone. And if everyone does something, that’s not generally thought of as great; it’s average.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Keys to Greatness**  \nSince that 96% is just about everyone, it would include just about all Christians and all non-Christians. Those groups have (or should have) different worldviews, which include different views on how to be great.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe world often confuses greatness with fame, though you can be famous these days without doing anything that would be considered great. Or they equate greatness with power, and think that competition and self-promotion are necessary to achieve greatness.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Bible clearly paints a different picture. Pretty much the opposite picture, in fact. For example, I looked up the word “greatest” in the Bible, and in every instance where it talks about how to become the greatest, it says one of two things:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. The humblest servant will be the greatest.**  \nJesus emphasizes this time after time, partly because the disciples (a group of young adults) were likewise overly concerned with being great.  \n  \n  \n  \n_They came to Capernaum. When he (Jesus) was in the house, he asked them, “What were you arguing about on the road?” But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest._  \n  \n  \n  \n_Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, “Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all.” – Mark 9:33-35_  \n  \n  \n  \nAt first glance this doesn’t seem to make sense. It’s part of God’s upside-down economy: the first shall be last, the leader is the servant, and [the meek will inherit the earth](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A1-12&version=NIV). But He also explained it in practical terms when He talked about [not choosing the best seat in the house](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+14%3A7-11&version=NIV). That story included one of Jesus’ favorite quotes, which He repeated on at least [three separate occasions](http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/?version=NIV&search=those+who+exalt+themselves+will+be+humbled+and+those+who+humble+themselves+will+be+exalted&searchtype=all&language1=en&bookset=2):  \n  \n  \n  \n_Those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted._  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd that does make sense, from either a biblical or a worldly perspective. Nobody really likes people who seek their own fame, while they absolutely love the humble star. For instance, if you’re an NBA fan, that’s pretty much the entire explanation for how people [felt about LeBron James joining the Miami Heat](http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5575810) and putting on a big show about his “Decision.”  \n  \n  \n  \nMost people want to exalt themselves, so there’s plenty of competition there. Being humble and serving others can actually be a way to stand out, in a good way.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you think that a humble servant couldn’t possibly be great, consider how Jesus, the greatest person ever and the most powerful being in the universe, lived this out. [Read Philippians 2:3-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A3-11&version=NIV); Paul puts it better than I can.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. God decides who is truly great.**  \nThat’s the other thing that stands out from the Bible on this topic, and it gives added meaning to Jesus’ words about who gets exalted and who gets humbled.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou can’t really make yourself great. Even if you have great capabilities that give you a high ceiling, you don’t create those capabilities on your own.  \n  \n  \n  \nKing David was one of the greatest people in the Old Testament, and someone whom [even God spoke highly of](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+13%3A22&version=NIV). So how did he become great?  \n  \n  \n  \n_Now then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and appointed you ruler over my people Israel. I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men on earth.’ – 1 Chronicles 17:7-8_  \n  \n  \n  \nDid you catch that? All of the steps in making David great, all of the action items in that passage, were taken by God. _“I took you…I appointed you ruler…I have been with you…I have cut off all your enemies…I will make your name like the names of the greatest men on earth.”_ That’s God speaking. The only action David took was “tending the flock”: he was a lowly shepherd, something akin to a teenager in Dallas today cutting lawns for his dad’s landscaping business. But David was humble, he was faithful, and he [waited patiently and trusted in God’s timing](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+24).  \n  \n  \n  \nReally, in light of eternity, [what does it matter](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+4%3A14) if you do become great in the eyes of men? Famous doesn’t equal fulfilled, and billionaires are just as likely to be depressed as anyone else. But if you focus on what God considers greatness, [you’ll receive eternal glory](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A19-20&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat do you think makes a person great?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[How to Change the World](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-change-the-world/)  \n[7 Signs You Might Be Headed for a Quarter-Life Crisis](http://theporch.wpengine.com/7-signs-you-might-be-headed-for-a-quarter-life-crisis/)  \n[The Power of Being Faithful](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-power-of-being-faithful/)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-be-great"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-be-great/"}}},

The 75212 zip code is an area where 67% of the adult population has less than a 12th grade education. 50% of current students live below the poverty line. And if you happen to have been born there, by your freshman year in high school it’s only 65% likely that you’ll finish through as a senior. And college? That’s reserved for just 2.2% of your neighbors.  \n  \nFor years now, the nation has identified West Dallas as a community in need. And the church has seen it too. Through His people God has been doing beautiful things. Under the direction of 7 ministry partners, Watermark members have been faithfully choosing to love West Dallas well. And things are changing.  \n  \n**#DoSomething**  \nThrough[Mercy Street](http://mercystreetdallas.org/), children have been partnered with mentors and given the opportunity for social and emotional growth through after school programming.

And we want to be a part of it.  \n  \nThese West Dallas ministry partners joined us after The Porch one night to invite us to serve with them on April 12th. And we did. Hundreds of us were spread all over the 75212 caring for the community through these partners. And again on April 26th we had the chance to return and celebrate a West Dallas Little League game with our friends at Mercy Street. Both Saturdays were fun, joy was shared, and God was glorified.  \n  \nBut imagine with us if an entire zip code were changed. What would it take? While both days of service were a wonderful place for us each to start, on their own they’re not enough. God isn’t asking us to sacrifice a Saturday, after all, He’s asking us to lay our lives down.  \n  \nWhat if an entire generation of believers were mobilized to be the church to the community? Stories like these, already happening, would be multiplied tenfold.  \n  \n**Next Steps**  \nSo what next steps are you taking to change a community?  \n  \nDid you join us during April?

I was being ignored, rejected, and unloved, and I didn't know why. I had put all of my worth and happiness in this person who now wanted to leave me. This wasn't the way I thought my life would go. I felt like I was part of a joke or in a dream that I would soon wake up from.  \n  \nAfter getting a divorce, I moved back in with my parents and tried to start a new life. Though I knew in my head that I didn't need a man to love me to be complete, I didn't believe it in my heart. To comfort myself, I sought the ways of the world. Although I was attending The Porch, I had one foot in the church and one foot in the world. I attended church on Sundays, but would then hang out with my friends who were constantly getting drunk. These things that looked fun were hurting me on the inside.  \n  \nIn spring of 2010, JP taught [a series called “Life Redefined.”](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/156/) I remember thinking that he was following me around and talking about what I had just done over the weekend. I was being destroyed on the inside by the guilt and shame from the poor decisions I was making to get drunk, which would lead to inappropriate relationships with men who didn't care about me.  \n  \nI tried to live life my own way, but it wasn't working. I continued making poor choices and struggled to follow Christ on my own. I looked to an imperfect man to define my worth, and when that didn’t work out, I turned to the ways of this world to satisfy my thirst, which only left me feeling more empty.  \n  \nIt took me running out of things to seek comfort and satisfaction in to realize the only thing that defines me and truly satisfies my soul is my identity in Christ. “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!” (2 Corinthians 5:17) Man does not define me, divorce does not define me, the mistakes of my past do not define me. I have been washed clean with the blood of Christ, and through Him all of my sins have been forgiven. I am no longer a slave to sin, but alive in Christ ([Romans 6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206)). What a beautiful truth we have in Christ!  \n  \nThroughout the past two years, I have begun to truly understand the gift of my salvation and what it looks like to follow Christ. I joined a community group that holds me accountable in my weaknesses and spurs me on to follow Christ and God's word ([Hebrews 10:24-25](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A24-25&version=NIV)). I also started [Equipped Disciple](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/equipped-disciple/), a ministry that has been instrumental in transforming my life to being rooted in Christ and making God's Word the firm foundation of my life.  \n  \nUltimately, I have come to find out, it's not about being single or married in this short life here on earth. It’s not even about the sins we commit, that we wish we hadn’t. It's about living for Christ and letting Him be the source of your identity. We are all children and co-heirs with Christ ([Romans 8:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A17&version=NIV)), which means we get to live a life defined not by our sin, but by our Savior."},"url":{"en-US":"redefined-by-christ"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/redefined-by-christ/"}}},

We begin to question what we’re doing with our lives before we’ve really done anything, and search desperately for a change in our career path, relationship status, or appearance.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you find yourself rapidly approaching the ripe old age of 30, here are seven things that may cause you to end up in a quarter-life crisis of your own.  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. You’re always comparing yourself to others.**  \nEspecially online. There are a lot more Joneses to keep up with now that everyone you know and everyone you want to be like keeps a digital representation of their life on social media.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe big problem with that, though, is that you’re not seeing a clear picture. In Facebook photos, everyone is always smiling. Everyone appears to always be on vacation, or out on the town with friends, or married to the best husband/wife in the world. Most people don’t publicly show off the negative things in their lives, or post an album about doing yard work or struggling to pay off their bills. Since you’re seeing a curated view of their life, your own life is going to look shabby by comparison.  \n  \n  \n  \nDon’t make that mistake, and don’t compare yourself to others who seem more fortunate. Comparison is the thief of all joy.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. You have unrealistic expectations.**  \nThis is one of the defining traits of our generation. We expect to succeed immediately at almost anything we do, without all of that hard work and patience nonsense. We’re special.  \n  \n  \n  \nNo one said life was going to be easy, though. In fact, I believe the saying is “life is hard.” Not “bad”; just “hard.” Being successful at anything takes time and work. You’re not entitled to anything, and shouldn’t expect everything to be handed to you just because you show up. Try a little [faithfulness](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-power-of-being-faithful/).  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. You think a romantic relationship will make you happy.**  \nI think this is a big cause of the quarter-life crisis. Many people grow up expecting to be married by a certain age, usually by their mid-twenties. But our generation is getting married later than ever—if they ever get married at all. So again expectations aren’t met, and there is pressure to compromise or settle for [living together](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/).  \n  \n  \n  \nI’m married, and though I think marriage is awesome, it’s also hard work. And it definitely isn’t a cure for anything. It doesn’t solve any problems, or validate your existence. And if marriage won’t, then living together or dating and breaking up definitely won’t. Simply put, don’t make your happiness dependent on your relationship status.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. You expect your job to make you happy.**  \nEnjoying your job is a good thing. But it’s not a requirement, and it’s generally not what you get paid for. If something’s fun, people will do it for free. If it’s not fun, but it must be done—that’s what people will pay good money for.  \n  \n  \n  \nOne problem with looking to your job for satisfaction is that few entry-level jobs are all that satisfying. And entry-level is where, by definition, you must start out. Plus, one thing that makes a job enjoyable is being really good at it, but you’re not going to be really good at something right off that bat. It takes time and practice. If you get dissatisfied and job-hop too quickly, you’ll never reach the point of being good at what you do.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you hate your job, [read this](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-to-do-if-you-hate-your-job/). And if you want to know what to do or how to make career decisions, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ypRZGC6UEc).  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. You think material things will make you happy.**  \nThey don’t. They may be exciting, briefly, or be seen as “cool” for about two months. But material things don’t bring lasting happiness. It’s a [scientific fact](http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/10/happiness.possessions/), with more articles than I can really link to.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you have excessive material possessions, they start to possess you. Cars break down. Houses require repairs, upgrades, and constant cleaning. The nicer your stuff is, the more you have to protect it or worry about something happening to it. And it all takes money, which can make you a slave to work or to debt. You end up feeling trapped, which is actually [phase one](http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2011/05/feeling-depressed-maybe-youre.html) of a quarter-life crisis.  \n  \n  \n  \n**6. You are focused solely on yourself.**   \n[Gen Y is known for being narcissistic.](http://www.watermark.org/media/why-not-me/2231/) Before us, there was no such thing as a “selfie.” (In fact, my spellcheck tool just listed that as a misspelled word, because it wasn’t in the dictionary yet when the software was written.)  \n  \n  \n  \nBut life’s not all about you, and focusing on yourself will not actually make you happy. It won’t win you many friends, for one thing, and God designed us as relational creatures. You also won’t make much of a difference with your life if your life is all you’re concerned about.  \n  \n  \n  \n**7. You believe this world is all there is.**  \nA quarter-life (or mid-life, or end-of-life) crisis actually makes sense if this life is all you have to hope for. After all, you’ve just used up a significant chunk of your life, and your time left is relatively short. And you don’t know exactly how short; something could happen tomorrow and a quarter-life could end up being all you get. So what have you done with your life? What are you going to do? And what difference does it really make?  \n  \n  \n  \nThankfully, this short life isn’t all there is. Maybe you only live once (YOLO), but you also live forever—in eternity somewhere. And you don’t have to work or behave in this life to “earn” heaven. Heaven isn’t dependent on what you’ve done or will do, but [what Jesus did](http://theporch.wpengine.com/losing-my-religion/).  \n  \n  \n  \nThat doesn’t mean you shouldn’t make your life count. But the way to make it truly count is to invest in eternity, and in the people who will remember your name long after the earth itself is gone.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you live in Dallas and are experiencing a quarter-life crisis, come [join us on Tuesday evening](http://theporch.wpengine.com/about-us/) as we talk about how to deal with it.

However, the Bible clearly says that [marriage is a blessing](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2018:22), just as being single can be a blessing. Marriage has its own set of benefits, which are equally as good as the benefits of singleness.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why being married is better than being single:**   \n  \n**1. It’s not good for man to be alone.**  \nThat’s from [Genesis 2:18](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2:18&version=NIV). We’re not designed to go through life alone. Now, you can be single and not be alone; that’s a big reason we push for [biblical community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/). But we can’t ignore that this verse is literally talking about marriage.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. You can do more together than you can apart.**  \nGod designed men and women to complement each other. They’re not just different; they’re different in exactly the right way. They make a complete team, and a good team can accomplish things that individuals working separately cannot.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. You experience intimacy.**  \nAll types of intimacy. (Not just physical intimacy, though that is included.) In marriage, you experience oneness. You share a life together. You know someone fully and are fully known by them, and you love and accept each other in that.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. It makes you a better person.**  \nMarriage is like hanging up a full-length, magnifying mirror on your life. It gives you the “[iron sharpening iron](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2027:17)” that you get from living in community, but in this case you’re living _with_ community and sharing _everything_ with them. You learn and grow from that, which is a good thing.  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. It’s a picture of God’s love for us.**   \nGod loves us and pursues us, no matter what. Even when that love required Christ’s self-sacrificial death on a cross, for a bride (the Church) who had done nothing to deserve it. He remained committed, and there was [nothing that could stop His love](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A38-39&version=NIV). And that is, in a less dramatic way, [what marriage is to be like](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A25-32&version=NIV). Two people demonstrating that kind of selflessness, forgiveness, acceptance, and commitment in a God-ordained marriage is the closest we can come to heaven on earth.  \n  \n  \n  \nDon’t read this and think that one life stage is clearly better than another. They’re different, and they each have their own challenges, but you should [be content wherever God has you](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4:11-13&version=NIV). If you are married, stay married and make the most out of it, loving each other as God has designed. If you’re single, make the most out of your singleness while you can.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor those who are married: what’s been the biggest or most surprising change compared to when you were single?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Should We Get Married?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-we-get-married/)  \n[Why Not Live Together?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/)  \n[Jesus’ Crazy Talk on Divorce](http://theporch.wpengine.com/jesus-crazy-talk-on-divorce/)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"5-reasons-why-marriage-is-better-than-singleness-and-vice-versa"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/5-reasons-why-marriage-is-better-than-singleness-and-vice-versa/"}}},

Considering marriage [statistics for our generation](http://theporch.wpengine.com/generation-why-statistics/), that basically makes it a singles ministry—or, based on responses to our [dating series](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/350/), perhaps a don’t-want-to-be-single ministry.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut being a single Christian can be a good thing. It doesn’t mean you’re “broken,” any more than the fact that [everyone is broken](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23-24&version=NIV). The Bible actually speaks pretty highly of being single, especially in passages like [1 Corinthians 7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+7&version=NIV). If you’re single and feel like life won’t really begin until or unless you get married, you may miss out on all the advantages that singleness has to offer.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why being single is better than being married:**  \n  \n**1. You have more time.**  \nNo matter how busy you may already feel, it’s true. In marriage, you’d be spending hours with your spouse or kids that right now you can [spend on other things—hopefully good things](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-to-do-while-youre-single/).  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. You have ultimate flexibility.**  \nAs a kid, your parents and teachers told you where to be and what to do. In marriage, your spouse has equal say on all significant decisions. Everything from where you live to what you’re doing this weekend has to fit into both your schedules and goals. As a single adult, you have the most flexibility and freedom you’ll ever have at any point in your life.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. You can work on yourself.**  \nGetting married won’t fix any of your flaws; it will just bring another person into your mess and shine a bigger spotlight on your struggles. Not saying you have to be perfect before getting married (you won’t be), but your time as a single person allows you to [overcome and heal from hurts, habits, and hang-ups](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery/) before they become even bigger issues in marriage.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. You’ll have fewer troubles.**  \nThat’s straight from [Scripture](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7%3A28&version=NIV): “Those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.” It’s part of that whole “marriage is hard” thing. Singleness isn’t necessarily easy, but it is simpler.  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. You can focus on God.**  \n“An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord’s affairs—how he can please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife— and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord’s affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband. I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.” – 1 Corinthians 7:32b-35  \n  \n  \n  \nWith a list like that, you may wonder why people would get married. My intent is not to say “don’t get married,” but simply “use your singleness well.” Don’t wait in a holding pattern until marriage; make the most of the life stage you’re in. Instead of focusing on losing the gift, focus on using the gift.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are married or are [considering marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-we-get-married/), don’t despair; come back next Monday for part two, “[5 Reasons Why Marriage Is Better Than Singleness.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-reasons-why-marriage-is-better-than-singleness-and-vice-versa/)”  \n  \n  \n  \nHow are you using your season of singleness?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Don’t Wait for Dates](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dont-wait-for-dates/)  \n[How to Spend Valentine’s Day if You Are Single](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-spend-valentines-day-if-you-are-single/)  \n[Video: The Reason You’re Single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7ovLu1gfgk&list=UUvot08iHtei5WItdADfZl5g)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"5-reasons-why-singleness-is-better-than-marriage-and-vice-versa"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/5-reasons-why-singleness-is-better-than-marriage-and-vice-versa/"}}},

But what does it mean, and how do you go about dating intentionally?  \n  \n  \n  \nI’m mostly (but not exclusively) talking to guys here, because we are the ones who need to “lead well” (another Christianese term) in dating. Leading well, being intentional, and frankly being a real man are all closely related.  \n  \n  \n  \n**A Definition**  \nYou won’t find the term in a dictionary, but I would say that intentional dating involves three basic elements:  \n  \n1. Having an intention (a purpose or plan);  \n2. With that purpose being an eventual marriage (to someone); and  \n3. Being clear about that purpose (though hopefully not in a weird way).  \n  \n**Having a Purpose**  \nAnytime you are dating someone, or even just going on a first date, there should be a reason for it. One-on-one dates usually don’t just happen by accident. There’s a purpose to it, and some kind of a plan.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is different from the current trend of “hanging out.” Hanging out with a group of friends or acquaintances (such as at [a Porch event this weekend](https://www.facebook.com/events/1436829083251289/)) is 100% fine and good, and can be a way to get to know someone that you may later end up dating. But “hanging out” is now often used to describe relationships that once would have been called “dating.” “Dating” implies at least a little bit of purpose and intentionality, whereas “hanging out” feels more random. You can “hang out” with anyone: your roommate, your grandma, or a stranger you just met. It doesn’t mean anything, which is exactly why some people use it to avoid the responsibility of “dating.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**Heading Towards Marriage (or a Break-up)**  \nWhen we talk about having a purpose when dating, I should clarify that it needs to be a good purpose. Many people go on dates with the purpose of having a one-night stand or making someone else jealous. But that’s not at all the kind of God-honoring intentionality we’re talking about.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe overall goal of a Christian’s dating life should be marriage. That doesn’t necessarily mean that you need to marry the next person you date, because they may end up [not being good marriage material](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dont-date-this-woman/) or a good match.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, the goal for any particular dating relationship is to get to know the person well enough to determine if you do want to marry them. If the answer is “no, we won’t be getting married,” that’s fine; [you just break up](http://theporch.wpengine.com/9-signs-you-should-break-up/) and move on. It’s not always fun, but it’s better than continuing deeper into a relationship that’s never going to go anywhere (or is going to go _somewhere_, but not a place you want to go).  \n  \n  \n  \n**Being Clear**  \nDating always involves two people, one of whom is not you. So, besides having a purpose for dating, you also need to let the other person know what your intentions are.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe key word here is “intentional,” not “intense.” Being intentional doesn’t mean discussing your upcoming marriage on the first date. That’s a bit weird, and really isn’t appropriate; it could either set up false expectations or rightfully scare them away. Remember, the goal is to get to know them and see whether you want to pursue the relationship further.  \n  \n  \n  \nHere’s what being clear does look like:\n\n  \n- Making it obvious that it is, in fact, a date. Girls, if a guy asks you out, one-on-one, has no business-related agenda, focuses the conversation on learning about you, and pays the bill, that should be enough evidence that it is a date. If he calls soon after to ask you out again, that’s a sign that he thought it went well.\n  \n- If things are going well, ask her out regularly, like once a week. That is way more clear than, say, going on one date in July and then calling her up again after Labor Day.\n  \n- Defining the relationship (DTR). This may not need to be a specific event, but if in doubt (or if she seems to be in doubt), clarify your intentions and where you stand.\n  \n- Don’t date more than one person at a time. Too many reasons to get into here, but it’s just not a good idea.\n  \n- Talk, don’t text. I hear this one all the time from single women, so I’m passing it along as a service. It is hard to clearly convey your intentions through short, written notes.\n  \n- If you go out on a number of dates or spend very much time together before deciding that it’s not going to work out, you’re going to have to let her know. Don’t just stop asking, or ignore her calls, and hope she’ll eventually figure it out. Sorry, it may be uncomfortable, but it’s part of being a man.\n  \n- In fact, make it your goal to leave her better than you found her (if it does come to leaving at all). Don’t set her up for a harder-than-necessary fall, and [treat her as a sister in Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+5%3A2&version=NIV). Besides being the right and loving thing to do, it will help you build a good reputation, because it’s a fact of life that people will talk.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, that’s some of what it means to date intentionally.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat examples have you seen or experienced of someone doing a good job of dating intentionally?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Who Should I Date?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-should-i-date/)  \n[Don't Date This Man](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dont-date-this-man/)  \n[Less Than 15 Dallas Date Ideas for Less Than $15](http://theporch.wpengine.com/less-than-15-dallas-date-ideas-for-less-than-15/)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"4qn033xMDmoq2aMS6kIMu6"}}},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-date-intentionally"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-date-intentionally/"}}},

That includes your relationship with God, first and foremost, but also your relationships with friends, family, and co-workers. Think about it: money won’t make you happy if you have no friends; career success won’t feel very good if you fail at your marriage; and having fun’s not very fun when you’re always by yourself.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you want your relationships to be happy, though, you’re going to have to get good at resolving conflict. Conflict comes with the territory. It’s part of living in a fallen world with imperfect, selfish people. People like me. I’ve unintentionally killed relationships due to conflict, before I learned how to handle it correctly.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Bible talks a lot about resolving conflict. Things like forgiveness and making peace are a major part of any Christ-follower’s life. So, it’s really clear in Scripture how we are to go about dealing with conflict. It’s simple, it makes logical sense, and it works.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Step 1: Acknowledge and ask forgiveness for your role in the problem.**  \nIt’s rare for there to be a conflict where it is wholly, 100% the other person’s fault. Even when it _seems_ like you did nothing wrong to contribute to the problem, carefully consider whether that’s the case. Is there anything you could have done differently to prevent the problem, or keep it from escalating the way that it did?  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is not at all “blaming the victim.” But it is taking responsibility for your own mistakes or sins against your neighbor. Practically, it is much, much easier to get someone to admit they were wrong when you first admit how you were wrong.  \n  \n  \n  \n_How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye. – Luke 6:42_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Step 2: Don’t sweat the small stuff.**   \nSome wrongs just aren’t that big a deal. There’s no reason we have to make them into a big deal in order to resolve them. If it’s a small offense, overlook it.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow do you know if it’s small enough to overlook? Basically: if you can overlook it, you probably should. However, if it’s bothering you, and you don’t have peace about it, then you need to go on to the next step. Don't call something that is bothering you a “small offense” because you don't want to put in the work to resolve it.  \n  \n  \n  \n_A person’s wisdom yields patience; it is to one’s glory to overlook an offense. – Proverbs 19:11_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Step 3: Talk to the person in private.**  \nIf you can’t overlook it, then you need to talk it out with the person who wronged you.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn Matthew 18, Jesus makes it clear how you are to go about this. You are to start by talking with them one-on-one. This means that there is no attempt to shame them or make them look bad in front of others. You take the problem to that person; you don’t gossip about them or complain about what they did to everyone but them. It’s possible that they may not even realize that they did anything wrong, so it’s not fair when you don’t give them a chance to apologize and make it right.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis step might be hard, but it’s not complicated. You tell them what they did and how it hurt you, and ask forgiveness for your part in the conflict if applicable (step 1). If they acknowledge that they were wrong and ask for forgiveness, you [forgive them](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A21-22&version=NIV). And then you’re done; you can move on. In most cases, there is no need for step 4.  \n  \n  \n  \n_If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. – Matthew 18:15_  \n  \n  \n  \nOn the other hand, if they won’t acknowledge that they have sinned against you and need forgiveness, you move on to:  \n  \n  \n  \n**Step 4: Bring others in.**  \n_But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’ If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector. – Matthew 18:16-17_  \n  \n  \n  \nYou could divide this one into three separate steps, though hopefully it won’t go that far:\n\n  \n- Take one or two other people with you, and again approach the other person about the problem. Who should you bring? Either a witness to the wrong, or someone you are in close [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/) with.\n  \n- If that doesn’t work, bring in church leadership. At [Watermark](http://www.watermark.org), a good portion of our staff’s time is dedicated to helping members resolve conflicts in their lives.\n  \n- And if that doesn’t work, Jesus says to “treat them as you would a pagan (a non-believer) or a tax collector.” Now, note that [Jesus spent much of His time with sinners, and Matthew himself was once a tax collector](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9%3A9-12&version=NIV). So, this means you should love them, not avoid them or treat them badly. But it does mean that they are choosing not to be a part of the church body, and you probably shouldn’t put yourself in a position to be hurt by them again.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nAt this point, even if they have refused to listen, you have peace in knowing that you’ve done literally everything you can do about it. The fault then lies solely with them.  \n  \n  \n  \n_If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. – Romans 12:18_   \n  \n  \n  \nHow do you handle conflict?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Judge Not?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/judge-not/)  \n[Conflict Crisis: Realigning With God’s Will (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sj08Okkvlw)  \n[Watermark’s Conflict Field Guide (PDF)](http://www.watermark.org/fileadmin/pdfs/conflict_field_guide_web.pdf)"},"url":{"en-US":"why-cant-we-all-just-get-along-4-steps-to-resolving-conflict"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-cant-we-all-just-get-along-4-steps-to-resolving-conflict/"}}},

If you are seriously dating someone, how long should it be before you pop the question? How much time does it take to determine if he or she is “the one”?  \n  \n  \n  \nThere’s no set answer on that. I know of people who have gotten married very quickly (like in a matter of days) and are still married decades later—and people who did the same thing and were divorced just as quickly. Or, a couple may be “in a relationship” for a decade, finally get married, and then split up in the first year.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt really depends on the people involved, and the reasons why they get married when they do.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What’s the rush?**  \nMost people realize that you shouldn’t get married too quickly after meeting someone, and the [one long-term study](https://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2003/love.html) I’ve found on the subject seems to back that up.  \n  \n  \n  \nThere are a couple of reasons why a short dating period can cause problems in marriage:  \n\n  \n- Neither of you get to know “the real you.” Anyone can put on a good show for a while, and in dating you’re probably trying to paint yourself in the best light possible. So you don’t get to know what they are really like until some time has passed, and in this case you’re already married by that point. ([Proverbs 19:2](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+19%3A2&version=NIV))\n  \n- People who get married quickly often do so because they are “so much in love”—which means they are basing the decision mostly on feelings. Feelings change. If you passively “fall in love,” you can also fall back out. I’m not saying you shouldn’t have strong feelings for the person you marry, but a marriage needs to be based on more than that. ([Jeremiah 17:9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+17:9))\n  \n  \n  \n  \nMarriage is really about commitment, so the real question is whether you are willing to commit to this person for the rest of your life, and whether you can trust them when they say they’re willing to do the same. That trust bit requires evidence and time.  \n  \n  \n  \nNow, sometimes you can trust them more quickly if other trustworthy people have known the person through [close community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/) for a long time, and can vouch for them. That’s actually the preferred situation, because then you have multiple sets of eyes confirming that this person is who they appear to be. But don’t just take your boyfriend or girlfriend’s word for it.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why wait?**  \nThat same study said that people who dated a very long time before marriage—like a number of years—were also less likely to stay married. In fact, they tended to divorce _quicker_ than those with short courtships.  \n  \n  \n  \nAgain, there are a couple of reasons why taking too long is a bad sign:  \n\n  \n- People sometimes wait because there are multiple warning signs that make them reluctant to marry the person. According to the study, those who “sense future problems while they are courting generally find out after they are married that their concern was well-founded.” ([Proverbs 26:11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+26:11&version=NIV))\n  \n- Many people today are in no hurry to marry because they are [already living together](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/). When you are too involved with someone for too long, getting married can become simpler than [breaking up](http://theporch.wpengine.com/9-signs-you-should-break-up/), even if breaking up before marriage is what you should do. And, as [Todd Wagner recently mentioned](http://realtruthrealquick.com/how-far-is-too-far/), going too far physically can keep you in a bad relationship longer, or kill a relationship before it can start. ([1 Corinthians 6:18-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A18-20&version=NIV))\n  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s not so much that people wait too long to get married, but that they stay in a relationship that never was built to last.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo there’s no set timeframe for how long you should date; it depends on the situation. And the key to making good decisions in any situation is to act wisely, trusting in the wisdom from God’s Word and the godly counsel of people who you’re sharing life with.  \n  \n  \n  \nHappily married couples: how long did you date before your wedding?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Should We Get Married?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-we-get-married/)  \n[5 Reasons Why Marriage is Better than Singleness (and Vice Versa)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-reasons-why-marriage-is-better-than-singleness-and-vice-versa/)  \n[How to Spot a Poser](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-spot-a-poser/)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"2vPyzEG10AKuao8qYMOWsk"}}},"url":{"en-US":"how-long-should-you-date-before-marriage"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-long-should-you-date-before-marriage/"}}},

According to the World Health Organization, America is the most anxious country in the world, with 1/3 of us suffering from an anxiety disorder at some point in our lives. And we Millennials are the most worried of all, according to the American Psychological Association. More than half of young adults surveyed admit to having lost sleep in the past month because of anxiety.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd that’s a bad thing, because worrying is a waste of life. Not just a waste of _time_, but a waste of _life_. As I mentioned in our [¼ Life Crisis](http://www.watermark.org/media/anxiety-crisis-the-leak-of-faith/3125/) series, worrying makes us less productive and keeps our physical bodies in a state of high stress, which over time can cause health problems.[According to WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/depression/stress-anxiety-depression), those health problems include six of the leading causes of death. Or, as Jesus in Matthew 6:27 says, “Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?” The answer, clearly, is “no.”  \n  \n  \n  \nNow you’re probably worried about the fact that you’re worried. So what do you do about it? You wage war on worry. Here’s how:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Remember that God is in control.**  \n  \nMatthew 6:33 says that, instead of worrying about worldly things, we should “seek first his kingdom.”  \n  \n  \n  \nGod is up to something. If our goal is to help advance God’s kingdom and focus on what is eternally important, we really have nothing to worry about. You can be certain that God will accomplish His purposes, so by aligning with His purposes, it’s impossible for you to fail.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat doesn’t mean you won’t face temporary earthly problems, as everyone does. But God works through those things as well, taking what is wrong and broken and redeeming it for a greater good. Which brings us to the next point:  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Remember that God is good.**  \n  \nYou wouldn’t really want God to be in control unless He was also good. Which is probably why the verse above (Matthew 6:33) continues: “seek first his kingdom _and his righteousness_.”  \n  \n  \n  \nThe dictionary definition of _righteousness_ is “the quality of being morally right or justifiable.” God is morally right—He defines the term—and everything He does or allows to happen is justifiable because He uses it to accomplish a greater good.  \n  \n  \n  \nI see this all the time in people who take their past mistakes or hardships and use those experiences to help others. That’s how pretty much [every ministry at our church](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/) started: people who had been through abortion, abuse, adoption, or alcoholism (just to give a few “A” examples) experienced healing and freedom through God’s work in their lives, and were then used by God to help dozens or hundreds of other people overcome the same problems.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt can still be hard to see God’s goodness in the short term, when in the midst of hard situations. That’s why you have to trust. When Jesus—the sinless, immortal Creator of the universe—was tortured and killed as a criminal, it looked like the most broken and unfair event in history. But God was in control even then, and used it to perform the greatest good in history.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Take it one day at a time.**  \n  \nFinishing up the passage in Matthew, we have this advice from Matthew 6:34: “Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.”  \n  \n  \n  \nI give my worries a 12-hour boundary. If it’s not coming up in the next 12 hours, I don’t worry about it. I might _prepare_ for it, if needed—I don’t wait until 12 hours before a sermon to start working on it—but I’m not going to _worry_ about it. I know that worrying about a potential problem doesn’t make it any less likely to happen, but it does make me less happy and less productive in the meantime.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat are you worried about?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Who is in Control?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-is-in-control/)  \n[Is God Good?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/is-god-good/)  \n[5 Keys to a Good Night’s Sleep](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-keys-to-a-good-nights-sleep/)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"waging-war-on-worry-3-steps-to-peace"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/waging-war-on-worry-3-steps-to-peace/"}}},

That freedom is one of the [benefits of being single](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-reasons-why-singleness-is-better-than-marriage-and-vice-versa/).  \n  \n  \n  \nIt wasn't a sin to not go to Europe, but it was getting stuck in a rut of sin that kept me from going.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Thinking that the bar and nightlife scene was “life.”**  \n  \nGo out drinking, pick up girls, wake up with a hangover. Wash, rinse, repeat. I was stuck for so long in a rut of sin, thinking that was how to have fun, yet never actually finding any joy there. Even non-believers tend to realize this problem eventually. Life isn’t found in a bottle or a one-night stand.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt wasn’t until after I started hanging out with a group of Christ-followers that I realized what I’d been missing out on. Sin robs you of creativity. I’ve since had much more fun getting to hang out with people I know and truly care about, and doing something new and creative each week: visiting lake houses, going overseas, throwing a [three-day party/concert/retreat](http://theporch.wpengine.com/launch-2013/) for a thousand people, or even just meaningful conversations with good friends. Most importantly, [real life is found in trusting Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10%3A10) and living out what you were always [created to do](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A10&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Dating for fun.**  \n  \nThis is closely related to the above. I treated dating like a game. “Winning” was getting the pleasure a girl offers without the commitment. There was a lot of drama; a lot of selfishness; and looking back now, a lot of hurt. It wasn't love, though I threw that word around a lot.  \n  \n  \n  \nNow I’m married, and realize what love really looks like and the joy that comes with it. But because of my dating history, the first couple of years of my marriage were very, very hard. It was misery, when it should have been one of the best times of my life. Spare yourself from that regret.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Spending everything I made.**  \n  \nI don’t want to turn this into an investment column, or say that you need to accumulate money. However, we are to be wise stewards of everything God gives us, including money. In my 20s, I spent a lot of money on things like nice cars, watches, and bar tabs. If I had that money back, with interest, it would be a lot of money. It could be a college fund for my kids, or [pay to feed and educate kids who otherwise have no hope](http://mohhaiti.force.com/sponsorship).  \n  \n  \n  \nFinancial choices early on in your life have a multiplier effect, much more so than when you are older. One of the most valuable pieces of advice I can give to someone in their 20s can be summed up in four simple words: live beneath your means.  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. Forming bad habits.**  \n  \nAs you start living on your own and making your own choices, you’re going to develop some habits. I happened to form some bad ones, which included everything from eating junk food to becoming [addicted to pornography](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-overcome-a-pornography-addiction/). And once habits or addictions are formed, they are very hard to break.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou can use that to your advantage, though, by forming good habits that will then also be hard to break. Habits like working out regularly (though not too excessively), sticking to a budget, and studying the Bible each morning.  \n  \n  \n  \n**6. Not taking discipleship more seriously.**  \n  \nSpeaking of investing well and forming good habits, I really regret my lack of discipleship when I was younger.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs believers, we are called to both [be disciples and make disciples](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+2%3A2&version=NIV). It’s the best investment you can make, in yourself and in others. It’s helpful to learn while you are young, so you can avoid mistakes like the ones I made. And because of [the way discipleship works, you can literally change the world](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-change-the-world/) if you just start early enough and remain faithful.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo those are my main regrets. Learn from my mistakes, so you don’t have to repeat them.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat is your biggest regret from when you were younger?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[10 Ways to Ruin Your Life in Your 20s](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-ways-to-ruin-your-life-in-your-20s/)  \n[10 Things to Do While You’re Single](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-to-do-while-youre-single/)  \n[5 Reasons Why Marriage is Better than Singleness (And Vice Versa)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-reasons-why-marriage-is-better-than-singleness-and-vice-versa/)"},"url":{"en-US":"6-biggest-regrets-of-my-20s"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/6-biggest-regrets-of-my-20s/"}}},

However, for two of the past three weeks I’ve been at family camps, talking with parents from around the country. And I’ve realized there’s a clear connection between the two: young adults, having been on their own for only a few years, are the recent _products_ of parenting. The type of parenting they received is the biggest influence on what they do and the choices they make.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo much of ministry involves identifying cause and effect, or pattern recognition. I’ve noticed some definite patterns over the past 7 years of young adult ministry, and seen the effects of different parenting styles. So, if you are a parent or hope to be one someday, here are 10 things I’ve observed from working with young adults:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Over-involved parenting can be just as harmful as neglect.**  \n  \nYou might disagree with that statement, but based on my observations, some of the most “wounded” young adults I’ve ministered to have had really involved parents—potentially too involved.  \n  \n  \n  \nBy “over-involved,” I don’t mean caring about whom they date or where they go. I mean never allowing them to fail, and rescuing them every opportunity you have. Parents who try to solve their twenty-something’s relational problems, absorb their breakup pain, enable their addictions, or cover their financial mismanagement are often hindrances to maturity. Sometimes you need to sit back and watch your kids fail and let them learn. Especially when they’re 30.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Abuse and abandonment leave lasting scars.**  \n  \nThis might seem obvious, but there seems to be an attitude these days that children are resilient, while adults are fragile. That a parent’s _desire_ for “freedom” outweighs a child’s _need_ for a parent. If a spouse (or parent) has abandoned a child, it is very important to talk with the child and parent them through that.  \n  \n  \n  \nAbuse is worse, and often happens in seemingly healthy homes in the least suspecting of ways. You don’t need to live in fear of it, but you should talk to your children about boundaries and where they can or should not be touched. Be specific, and give them courage to reach out for help regardless of potential threats. This looks like: “Presley, if someone touches you somewhere private, and they tell you if you tell anyone they are going to hurt your family, what should you do?”  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Divorce impacts everyone.**   \n  \nDon’t think that you, the divorcee, are the only victim of your divorce. I’ve seen first-hand how it impacts everyone involved. Kids have to deal with abandonment and trust issues, for instance. And divorce can impact our view of God, who promises to love His bride (believers in the church) through all of our shortcomings.  \n  \n  \n  \nPlease reach out to the church for [help if you’ve been divorced](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/divorcecare/), or if you are considering it. If divorce is a part of your story, [process it carefully with your children](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/divorcecare-4-kids/). Have your community help you, and together carefully consider the implications for your kids. There’s tons of grace available, but be wise and invite others into how you process it.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Both male and female parenting influences are important.**  \n  \nNow, I understand that statement discourages single parents. Take heart; single parents are my heroes! You can still get these male and female influences through the church, extended relatives, and formal discipleship.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are a young adult who only had one parent, don’t lose hope either. Just consider how that has impacted your worldview and your understanding of God. Some of the most influential pastors I know came from broken homes; they’ve just worked to heal from that and understand how it has impacted them.  \n  \n  \n  \nHaving both a mommy and a daddy is God’s design for childhood. As we move away from God’s design, we need to be mindful of the ramifications of that.  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. Discipline is important.**   \n  \nIf I hang with a group of young adults for very long, I bet I can tell you with some accuracy which ones lacked discipline in the home.  \n  \n  \n  \nConsistency is the name of the game in discipline and parenting. Sometimes I talk with young adults and they reference a change in parenting based on a divorce or other event. It’s clear they not only noticed this change, but they realize they were impacted by it.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn our home we discipline for _deliberate disobedience or disrespect_. We don’t “count to three” or give warnings. If you are disrespectful or deliberately disobedient you know that results in discipline, every time. With one exception: sometimes [we will intentionally give “grace”](http://theporch.wpengine.com/grace-like-a-lollipop/)(getting something good you don’t deserve) or “mercy” (not getting the discipline you deserve) to help teach those virtues.  \n  \n  \n  \n**6. Discipleship is important**.  \n  \nExtraordinary kids usually come from extraordinary parents. There is no surprise when one of our rock star young adult leaders talks about seeing their parents up early and in the Word.  \n  \n  \n  \nA key to discipleship in the home is being intentional. Being intentional often requires a plan. I am much better at impromptu teachable moments than I am at planning. Both, however, are necessary. If you’re not a planner, I’d talk to others who are and learn what they do.  \n  \n  \n  \n**7. Meal times matter.**  \n  \nDo you think that’s weird? Well, it’s true. No wonder why Jesus ate with people He cared about and wanted to minister to. We do this in our families, and key teaching moments or observations often happen around the table.  \n  \n  \n  \nMake sure you are not constantly running different directions at meal times. If you are, you are missing key “intentional” times.  \n  \n  \n  \n**8. Church is crucial.**  \n  \nDon’t go to church “for your kids.” They won’t want to be there and they’ll end up hating church. But it’s important that you, as a parent, belong to a healthy, bible-teaching church and are clearly involved there. This helps teach your children that the most important thing in life is to know God and belong to His body, which is the church.  \n  \n  \n  \n**9. Parent in community.**  \n  \nSome of the healthiest adults I know reference back to the healthy relationships their parents had with other believers. There’s something to [this community thing](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/).  \n  \n  \n  \nEveryone has parenting “misses.” Other parents can help you see the blind spots in your parenting, as long as you’re open to them pointing the blind spots out.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn pointing out blind spots, make sure you separate questions about morals (right vs. wrong) from values (preferences). You do not need to hold others accountable to what you value (like bedtimes, types of food, comfort levels, etc.) but do hold them accountable to what the Scriptures speak into.  \n  \n  \n  \n**10. God is bigger than bad parenting**.  \n  \nDo everything you can to become a great parent, but a key part to parenting is letting God be God and watching Him work it all out. His grace covers a multitude of parenting mistakes. Some of the most incredible young adults are exceptions to all the rules. They came from broken, abusive homes and God has mended their hearts and unleashed them to do His work.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo no matter what you’ve done or what your situation may be, you’re not doomed. Pray a lot and do the best you can moving forward.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat things did your parents do that you’re thankful for?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Letter to Future Mothers](http://theporch.wpengine.com/letter-to-future-mothers/)  \n[Letter to Weston](http://theporch.wpengine.com/letter-to-weston/)  \n[Divorce and Reconciliation](http://theporch.wpengine.com/divorce-and-reconciliation/)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"10-parenting-lessons-i-learned-from-young-adults"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/10-parenting-lessons-i-learned-from-young-adults/"}}},

Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly. – Matthew 26:74-75_  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s probably safe to say that we’ve all felt shame. It’s a consequence of sin. In fact, it’s the very first consequence of sin: in the Garden of Eden, Genesis 2:25 states that “Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.” In _the very next verse_ the serpent arrives and convinces them to sin, and immediately after sinning they feel shame and try to hide their nakedness. With shame, paradise is lost.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut nowhere does it say that God _wants_ us to be ashamed. He doesn’t feel better if we feel miserable. His plan wasn’t for us to punish ourselves, as if that was somehow the way to avoid punishment from Him. Instead, Jesus took the punishment on Himself so that we don’t have to.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd Jesus is the key to overcoming the shame that’s holding you back.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Jesus pursues us in our shame.**  \n  \nAfter Peter swore that he would die before disowning Jesus—and then swore, that same night, that he’d never even met Jesus—he must have felt pretty worthless.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn John 21, after Jesus’ resurrection, Peter announces that he’s “going out to fish.” Now, remember that fishing is Peter’s job; it’s where he was working full-time before Jesus called him to join the ministry and become a “fisher of men.” So this is the equivalent of someone today saying “I’m going to the office” or “I’m going back to work.” Instead of fishing for men, he’s just fishing for fish; perhaps he no longer feels worthy of telling others about Jesus after telling people he didn’t even know Him.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut Jesus pursues us even in our shame. With Peter, He shows up on the shore and [recreates the miracle](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+21%3A3-11&version=NIV) He performed back [when He first called Peter to “fish for people.”](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+5%3A4-11&version=NIV) Basically, he calls Peter again to follow Him, showing that Peter is not disqualified despite anything he’s done.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod never stops pursuing us. He never gives up. No matter what you’ve done or how many times you’ve done it. He knows what you did and everything you’re going to do, and [He chose to die for you anyway](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:8&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \n**Jesus restores us from shame.**  \n  \nJesus did more than recreate a miracle in John 21. He then went about recreating the situation where Peter denied Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \nPeter [had sworn he wouldn’t deny Jesus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A33-35&version=NIV) during a meal with the disciples, so here Jesus [cooks a meal for the disciples](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A33-35&version=NIV). Peter denied Jesus while [warming himself around a fire](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+18%3A18&version=NIV), so here Jesus [builds a fire for them](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+21%3A9&version=NIV). (In fact, that particular word for “fire,” which can be translated to “burning coals,” appears only twice in the Bible: when Peter denies Jesus, and here when Jesus talks with Peter. It’s the same type of fire.)  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd then, in this familiar setting, Jesus asks Peter if he loves Him. Not once, not twice, but [three times in a row](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+21%3A15-17&version=NIV). Each time, Peter affirms that “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” Peter denied Jesus three times, so Jesus gives Peter three opportunities to affirm Him. Jesus didn’t do it to shame him, but rather to free him from shame.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s what God does: he restores us. Shame keeps you from having a truly intimate relationship, but God actively seeks to restore us to relationship with Him.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Jesus replaces shame with purpose.**  \n  \nEach of the three times Peter said that he loved Jesus, Jesus replied with “feed my lambs” or “take care of my sheep.” He wasn’t only trying to make Peter feel better; He had a mission for him.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe very name “Peter” was [a nickname Jesus gave him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16:17-19&version=NIV), a word that means “rock.” He was called that because Jesus planned for Peter to be the foundation of the early church. After wavering and denying Him right when it seemed Jesus needed him most, Peter probably wasn’t feeling like much of a “rock.”  \n  \n  \n  \nBut here Jesus reaffirms his mission, asking Peter to shepherd the church and again calling him to “Follow me!”  \n  \n  \n  \nAfter this, Peter lived up to his name. Less than two months after denying Jesus in front of a few people, he was [preaching the good news about Him in front of thousands](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A1-41&version=NIV). When [arrested and put on trial](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+4%3A1-21&version=NIV) by the same men who crucified Jesus, he courageously told them the Truth. And years later, when given the chance to again deny Jesus and live, Peter instead chose the cross.  \n  \n  \n  \nDid Peter become a “rock” _despite_ his earlier failings, or _because_ of them?  \n  \n  \n  \nAll the time, I see God help people overcome shame and use them to help others. Past adulterers become leaders in [restoring marriages](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/reengage--marriage-ministry/). Women who have had abortions start [abortion recovery ministries](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/someone-cares--abortion-restoration/). Men who were sexually abused as children help others [find healing from abuse](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/mend/). I could go on and on.  \n  \n  \n  \nGod doesn’t want us to live under a cloud of shame. He’s forgiven us. He wants to heal us from shame, bring us out of whatever’s causing it, and give us new purpose in helping others.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow is shame holding you back from your mission?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Redemption: The Message of Reconciliation (sermon)](http://www.watermark.org/media/redemption-the-message-of-reconciliation/3142/)  \n[Redefined by Christ](http://theporch.wpengine.com/redefined-by-christ/)  \n[Beauty for Ashes](http://theporch.wpengine.com/beauty-for-ashes/)"},"url":{"en-US":"overcoming-shame"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/overcoming-shame/"}}},

Of course, I’m married myself. I know that for some singles, wedding season is not always seen as an encouraging thing. That can especially be the case if you have multiple friends all getting engaged or married at once.  \n  \n  \n  \nAlways the bridesmaid, never the bride? Wonder why you’re the “best man,” but somehow not the one getting married?  \n  \n  \n  \nYou don’t have to let it get you down. Here are some important things to remember when it seems like everyone’s getting married except for you:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. It doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you.**  \n  \nThere’s something wrong with everyone, married or not, because [we are all sinners](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:23&version=NIV). But you’re not necessarily still single, and your friends now married, because you’re somehow not as good as they are. Being single doesn’t make you a failure; if it did, Jesus, Paul, and Jeremiah would all fit in that category.  \n  \n  \n  \n[Ephesians 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A10&version=NIV) says that you are God’s handiwork or masterpiece. [Psalm 139:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+139%3A14&version=NIV) says that you were wonderfully made. You are made by God, and have great worth. That truth doesn’t change based on your [relationship status](http://theporch.wpengine.com/your-christmas-relationship-status/).  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. God’s not punishing you.**  \n  \nThe Bible does say that [a spouse can be a good thing](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+18:22&version=NIV) and is a gift from the Lord. However, there are probably [just as many verses](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=quarrelsome+wife&qs_version=NIV) about how having the wrong spouse can be a bad thing, or how [any marriage comes with its share of troubles](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+7:28&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n  \nSo don’t look at marriage as some kind of reward that you can earn, or see singleness as a sign that God doesn’t love you. When a promising relationship doesn’t work out, it might be because God _does_ love you and is sparing you from a bad situation.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Don’t settle.**  \n  \nSpeaking of bad situations, it’s important that you don’t become so focused on getting married ASAP that you settle for something less than what God desires for you. Most specifically, if you are a follower of Jesus, [_don’t_ marry someone who is not](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%206:14).  \n  \n  \n  \nI know that the numbers of [godly single women](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-man-should-look-for-in-a-woman/) and [godly single men](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-woman-should-look-for-in-a-man/) are not equal, and that means some people would necessarily remain single. So, if necessary, remain single. Being single is far better than being married to the wrong person.  \n  \n  \n  \nAlso, [don’t settle for the “pretend marriage” of living together](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/). Since there is no real commitment involved in living together, the odds are that you’ll eventually break up—and experience many of the real emotional consequences you’d get from a divorce. And even if you do end up married, studies show that you’ll most likely be less happy than if you hadn’t lived together first.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. You’re not being left behind.**  \n  \nWhen a friend marries, it doesn’t have to mean you are losing that friend. Married people don’t disappear into some alternate universe where single friends aren’t allowed. They don’t transform into a new person who no longer likes the people they used to like.  \n  \n  \n  \nYes, they’ll have some different priorities now, and it’s quite likely that they won’t have as much time to hang out with you. And if we’re talking about a friend of the opposite sex, it’s probably best that you _not_ be close friends after marriage. But for close friends of the same sex, you can and probably should stay friends. Your friendship will look different, but you will both still be the same people with the same interests and history as before. Be understanding of their new commitment to their spouse, but don’t abandon them.  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. You’re not alone (or you don’t have to be).**  \n  \nSingle people should not be alone. I don’t mean they need to get married or be dating someone; I mean they shouldn’t be alone as singles.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you’re not already, I would strongly encourage you to get involved in a [community group](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/), or a close biblical community of believers. They can help you grow in faith, make wise decisions (including dating decisions), and overcome struggles or roadblocks in your life. They can also become close, lifelong friends, until they get married and leave you forever. (Just kidding! See #4.)  \n  \n  \n  \nAlso, get a roommate. It will save you money and train you to possibly be a better spouse someday.  \n  \n  \n  \n**6. You’re not missing out.**  \n  \n[Marriage is awesome](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-reasons-why-marriage-is-better-than-singleness-and-vice-versa/). But you know what else is awesome? [Being single](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-reasons-why-singleness-is-better-than-marriage-and-vice-versa/). One’s not necessarily better than the other; they both have big benefits and disadvantages. Don’t waste your single years because you’re too bummed out about being single. [Here are some cool things you can do instead](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-to-do-while-youre-single/).  \n  \n  \n  \n**7. Rejoice with those who rejoice.**  \n  \nThat’s a quote from [Romans 12:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A15&version=NIV). Part of loving a friend is to celebrate when they have reason to celebrate, or (also from that verse) mourn with them when they have reason to mourn. It may be a selfless sacrifice sometimes, but so is love.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’m not saying you need to go to every wedding; just that you should try to be happy for them rather than being jealous or bitter.  \n  \n  \n  \nJust curious: how many weddings have you been to this year? How have you handled it?  \n  \n  \n  \n[- JP](https://plus.google.com/103150385276226095900?rel=author)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Why Am I Still Single? 7 Things To Consider If You’re Single And Don’t Want To Be](http://wordsfromwags.com/why-am-i-still-single/)  \n[Who Should I Date?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-should-i-date/)  \n[Dating 101: The Ask](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dating-101-the-ask/)\n\n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"10yxlnSVL8q2YaQogWqSG2"}}},"url":{"en-US":"everyone-is-getting-married"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/everyone-is-getting-married/"}}},

Or perhaps this is the first time you’ve heard anything about it at all. Either way, we’re excited to let you know that the beginning of The Porch in Fort Worth is now not-so-distant, and the details are here for you to have and share!  \n  \n**What is The Porch Fort Worth?**  \nThe Porch has always been not only a gathering, but a movement of young adults—a mission. Fort Worth young adults will therefore gather and move together for the same reasons that they do in Dallas: to connect with others, connect with God, and learn to live out more of what He desires for singles in our culture. The Porch in Fort Worth will provide the same opportunity for young adults (20s/30s) in Tarrant County and the surrounding area as it does in Dallas—to come just as they are, but not leave unchanged.  \n  \n**When and where is The Porch Fort Worth meeting?**  \nThe Porch Fort Worth will begin on Tuesday, September 2nd at 7:30 pm at the Ridglea Theater Complex (3345 Winthrop Avenue, Fort Worth, 76116) and will continue every Tuesday night at the same time.  \n  \nThere is presently no plan for either Dallas or Fort Worth to meet on a Tuesday when the other does not; every Tuesday that The Porch gathers in Dallas, we will gather in Fort Worth!  \n  \n**Why are we launching a new Porch?**  \nWell, it’s not really “new,” and it’s not really “another” Porch. This is true because the very same work that began to influence Dallas through The Porch nine years ago has now spanned many miles and countries, and has struck Fort Worth strongly along the way. For well over a year, several small pockets of young adults from Fort Worth have crossed the metroplex on Tuesday nights to gather in Dallas, many of whom are now volunteer leaders on the Porch team in Fort Worth. In coming to Fort Worth, we’ve not added a second Tuesday-night Porch; we’ve added a new section of seats to the existing one—50 miles to the west.  \n  \nIn short, we’ve chosen to begin The Porch in Fort Worth because:  \n1) There is a strong, consistent desire for it among young adults in the city;  \n2) There is a trusted group of volunteer servant-leaders who have demonstrated their willingness and ability to carry the weight of the ministry; and  \n3) Most of all, because God desires to reconcile young adults in Fort Worth to Himself in loving relationship, and we humbly hope that He would use our efforts to do so.  \n  \n**What can I do to help?**   \nThree things! First and foremost, you can pray that God would be the enabler and accomplisher of The Porch’s ministry in Fort Worth. The Scriptures say that “unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain” ([Psalm 127:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+127%3A1&version=NIV)). May we never labor in vain in Fort Worth or Dallas!  \n  \nSecondly, you can share this news with any young adult you know from Weatherford to east Arlington. Mid-cities Porch-goers are of course welcome at whichever gathering serves them best (although in the interest of building meaningful relationships and being known and loved by others, we would encourage you to be consistent at whichever location makes the most sense for you).  \n  \nThirdly, you can let us hear from you. You can reach us at all of the below outlets, and we’d love to get to know you!  \n  \nFB: [The Porch Fort Worth](https://www.facebook.com/theporchfw)  \nT: [@theporchFW](https://twitter.com/theporchFW)  \nI: [@theporchFW](http://instagram.com/theporchfw)  \nemail: theporchFW@watermark.org  \n  \nLastly, on behalf of the entire faithful and passionate Porch Fort Worth team, I’d like to extend a very warm, very personal, and very old invitation to you ([John 1:46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A46&version=NIV)) about the Christ who has saved and changed each one of us so lovingly and consistently…  \n  \n**“Come and see!”**  \n  \n- Garrett Raburn  \n  \n[![Garrett](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/garrett.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/garrett.jpg)  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Porch History Lessons](http://theporch.wpengine.com/porch-history-lessons/)  \n[Best Practices for Leading Young Adults](http://theporch.wpengine.com/best-practices-for-leading-young-adults/)  \n[Measuring Ministry Success](http://theporch.wpengine.com/measuring-ministry-success/)"},"url":{"en-US":"the-porch-fort-worth"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-porch-fort-worth/"}}},

Thinking about getting engaged?  \n  \n  \n  \nWe spend years studying and taking classes to prepare for our careers, but very little time preparing for marriage.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s why, before you put a ring on the finger or take those vows, we strongly encourage you take Merge.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What is Merge?**  \n  \nMerge is Watermark’s premarital ministry, designed to give engaged and seriously dating couples a unique opportunity to learn, seek wisdom, and receive counsel about marriage in a safe, fun, challenging and authentic environment.  \n  \n  \n  \nMerge exists to prepare couples for marriage by addressing common challenges in marriage from a biblical perspective. Couples are placed at a small group table with one mentor couple and 2-3 other participating couples throughout the class.  \n  \n  \n  \nMerge is a big class (100+ couples at each session) and consists of large group teaching and small group table discussion. Couples also can expect a few hours of homework every week.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Who is Merge for?**  \n  \nMerge is for couples who are engaged or seriously dating.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Seriously dating? Are we “serious” enough to go to Merge?**  \n  \nWhat does seriously dating mean? Seriously dating does not mean you just started dating one or two months ago. We don’t place a time limit on couples, but if you are dating and you are considering putting a ring on the finger, then it’s probably the right time to go through Merge.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why should we go to Merge?**  \n  \nMarriage is a HUGE decision. Too many couples focus all their energy on the wedding day and spend little time and resources on the relationship/marriage itself. We are all for great wedding days, but our greatest hope is for an incredible marriage.  \n  \n  \n  \nOften the church falls short in preparing couples for marriage. The church either assumes couples don’t need marriage prep, or we let them slide by with weak and surface-level counsel. We miss the mark by not challenging couples on the significance of the decision in front of them. After they say “I do,” the church often stands by as couples collapse all around us or silently watches them fall into mundane routines – they are married on paper but live as if they are roommates with occasional and sporadic benefits.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What will we discuss?**  \n  \nWe discuss everything you need to think about and talk through before you get married. We give you a Christ-centered, biblically-based picture of marriage and teach on all the topics you would expect in a marriage class: communication and conflict, money, sex, in-laws, and much more. We don’t sugarcoat anything in Merge: you will get the full-on, real picture of marriage from authentic, caring leaders who love each other and care deeply for other couples.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What makes Merge unique?**  \n\n  \n- High levels of authenticity and transparency about marriage.\n  \n- You can learn a lot from books and other classes about marriage. You can watch some good prep videos online. In Merge, however, you not only get good teaching and content, you also get matched up with a mentor couple who really care about you and your relationship. Having a mentor couple lead you through the experience is the main thing that sets Merge apart from most marriage prep classes.\n  \n- We have a whole lot of fun along the way.\n  \n  \n**Will she break up with me?**  \n  \nWell… there’s a chance she might. And you might break up with her. The goal of Merge is not to break couples up. However, along the way, some couples will realize that marriage with their significant other may not be God’s best for them. If that’s the case, it will be the best time and money you could spend if it spares you from a divorce or a miserable marriage.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How do I sign up?**  \n  \nYou can get all the information and details about Merge at [dallasmarriage.org](http://dallasmarriage.org). We have regular 8-week classes, and a few weekend classes for those couples who both can’t attend the 8-week class.  \n  \n  \n  \n[The next class](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/merge---premarital/) starts on October 1, and more classes will start throughout the year in 2015. The class costs $80/couple for the 8-week class and $100/couple for the weekend class. The cost covers materials, food and other resources.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd… guess what? All couples who complete the class who get married in Texas will receive a certificate that allows them to get $60 off the cost of their Texas marriage license.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Tell me again… Why should I sign up for Merge?**  \n  \nMarriage is much harder than you would ever expect (see 1 Corinthians 7:28, or the testimony of any married couple). Even more so, marriage is much greater than you could ever hope for. We would love for the church to help you make this decision and to prepare you along the way.  \n  \n  \n  \nAny unanswered questions about Merge?

Below are some of his thoughts on fame, fatherhood, community, and Kenny G.  \n  \n**How did you become a Christian?**  \n  \nI was raised in a very religious Christian mindset: went to Christian camp, knew all the songs, knew all the things, but I had a really broken past with my mom and stuff of that nature. There was a disconnect between what was going on, and what I thought, and what my life was actually like. There was a lot of brokenness, a lot of discontent.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo then I get to high school and that discontent gets so wide that I finally say this doesn't seem real, this doesn't seem applicable, so I’m just going to go down the lifestyle that feels best. That’s when I went down the very typical hedonistic lifestyle: girls, alcohol, stuff like that. That took me to freshman year of college, and that is when it really spiraled because of no authority, on my own.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd then God totally woke me up in the course of a week or two. In a very close amount of time I got kicked off the baseball team, which was the only reason I went there; got put on academic probation, which means I’m about to kicked out if I get any worse grades; and then my first serious girlfriend broke up with me. If all of those things are really happening at once it sort of shocks you awake, per se. So I kind of pulled my head out of the sand and said: what am I doing? Why am I here? I started asking the really big questions that I think sometimes pain can have you ask. It was through those questions, through that seeking, that I actually turned back to the Scriptures and really saw a Jesus that I didn't see growing up: this real radical grace, this covenant, this beauty of Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut the crazy thing is it wasn't over night. This was a period from in-between first and second semester all the way to the end of that year, of me just studying, thinking, and (I would say now) walking with Jesus. But what’s funny is I got to the end of that year, and I thought I was being all investigative, but then I kind of looked back on that last six months and was like, well, I guess I’m a Christian now. I looked back and I realized I was reading Scripture, I was in community, I _loved_ Jesus, there was a heart change, so I must have been a Christian. And for me that was actually a big deal because I though it had to be overnight, you know, rainbows and everything had to pop out of the sky. But there was a heart transformation and I didn't even realize that. I just wanted more of Jesus. I think it was Spurgeon who said “you don’t need to know your birthday for you to be born.” So that was my experience. I totally changed and transformed, and when I looked back I said, man, something really special happened these last couple of months.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What kind of music do you listen to?**  \n  \nI literally listen to everything. I listen to 70s, 80s, 90s. Bon Jovi, rap, hip-hop. I love Kenny G, I love smooth jazz, I love saxophone. I literally have the weirdest iPod list you will ever see. Alyssa (my wife) will attest that.  \n  \n  \n  \n**If there was one song you had to listen to on repeat over and over what would it be?**  \n  \nThat’s tough. Probably something by Rich Mullins. I _love_ him. I would probably say “Hold Me Jesus” by Rich Mullins. I love that song. Or actually all his songs. His CD “Songs 2,” which is his greatest hits, that whole CD I could listen to on repeat.  \n  \n  \n  \n**You’re a new dad. How has being a father changed you?**  \n  \nI would say two-fold: one, in the sense of what it’s taught me about God; and two, in the sense of how much it’s just really murdering my sin, basically.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe first one—what it’s taught me about God—is just this idea that God’s a Father. There’s nothing Kinsley had to do to get my love. When she was born I didn't have to put her under a contract or say “you’re on probation” or whatever. And what’s crazy is when they’re a baby they literally—not to say it kind of blunt—but they literally do nothing. They literally eat, poop, and sleep. But I’m still so in love with her. So what that teaches us about the heart of God is really beautiful. And then also when you’re having full responsibility over someone like that, I think that is a huge part, too. Life doesn't exist for me. There’s someone that really depends on me. There’s Alyssa and Kinsley. So it’s really making me very selfless.  \n  \n  \n  \n**You weren’t really trying to get the spotlight, and yet God put you in the middle of it all. You essentially wrote a poem, posted it on YouTube, and it went viral. How has that changed you?**  \n  \nTo some degree I have to give honor to it and not just bash it because it was amazing what happened. It was all God’s grace. And literally my entire life has changed: where we live, how we make income, what I get to do for a hobby and fun, and what I get to work for. All that stuff is huge. And then I would probably say the biggest thing for me is, God taught me a real big thing about [faithfulness](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-power-of-being-faithful/). I didn't do that poem so that it would go viral. I did it because I really loved the students who I was investing in, and wrote that poem to my peers at college. So that was a real big thing of faithfulness: God can take something and use it if He wants, but always get back to just the faithfulness of something.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd then that thing you said about living loud. I think a lot of us go for that. And for me this is a bigger temptation because I’m able to do stuff that maybe gets a good amount of views. So for me I have to always fight the fact that if I’m ever feeling a desire in my heart—like if I wake up and I am more excited to work on a poem or more excited to work on my next book than I am to be with Kinsley and Alyssa and serve them and love them—that’s when I know that something is getting off base, because that’s my first ministry. Family is first ministry. It’s this anchor. I think everything beautifully flows out of that if you are really giving your all there. And everything really doesn't bear fruit if you are not getting that right. So for me that’s what I've really learned. But that’s a really quiet life, right? Dad life and husband life is a very quiet life. It’s a quiet faithfulness, it’s a longevity of 30, 40, 50 years hopefully.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Despite the success you've seen, there’s a humility about you that I've been encouraged by. Where does that come from?**  \n  \nThe first thing that comes to mind is [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/). I still have the same group of friends and a lot of the same mentors.  \n  \n  \n  \nCelebrity culture, especially in Christendom, is just weird. It’s funky, and it’s there, but what’s going here? I don’t think we've really thought through what that means, and what we are dealing with. Especially with social media.  \n  \n  \n  \nI just always come back to the fact that, like people who see me in a restaurant and say “hi”—love them to death, I love hearing that they’re encouraged and all that—but at the end of the day that person doesn't know me. So this person is kind of freaking out and wants to take a picture and all this stuff because they don’t know me. But what’s funny is my best friend Jeff Cherry, he’s never done that to me. He’s never freaked out and wanted to take a picture with me. Alyssa neither. Why? Because they _know_ me. When you get deeper in intimacy there’s this level where I think the Superman-ness goes away. I think the people who go down a really dangerous path in celebrity culture surround themselves with only fans, and not friends. If you’re surrounding yourself with only people who praise you or only yes men, or whatever, that’s really problematic because they don’t know you. They know a cropped, edited you.  \n  \n  \n  \nPeople who just know me for me, who know my struggles, my failures and all that stuff, that’s where I think the real humility comes from. And then it’s not even really a humility you’re trying for; it’s just normal life. Alyssa and Jeff Cherry, they’re not really impressed by me.  \n  \nJefferson Bethke, Interviewed by JP\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"q-a-with-jefferson-bethke"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/q-a-with-jefferson-bethke/"}}},

He said, “I believe in Jesus; I just don’t believe that gay people are going to hell.”  \n  \n  \n  \nThis was surprising, because A) we hadn't been talking about homosexuality at all, and B) I also don’t believe that gay people are going to hell. But he had made that assumption—as he then explained, that’s what he “knew” the church believed—and he took issue with that perceived fact.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s easy to see, therefore, how the ongoing debate about homosexuality and same-sex marriage is dividing the church and driving some non-believers away. There are a lot of assumptions and misunderstandings, on all sides, and confusion within the Christian community about how to reconcile all that’s going on.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Same Love**  \n  \nPart of the problem, as evidenced by my friend’s reaction, is that homosexual activity has been given some kind of different, special status. He didn't say, “I just don’t believe that alcoholics are going to hell,” or “I just don’t believe that a heterosexual couple who sleep together outside of marriage are going to hell.” But according to the Bible, those statements are all equivalent (1 Corinthians 6:9-10).  \n  \n  \n  \nSo why are they treated differently? Partly, it’s because no one is calling for drunkard’s rights or asking to make shoplifting legal. For some people within the church, I imagine it might have something to do with familiarity: you’re not likely to say anything against heterosexual sin if you’re actively engaged in it, for instance.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor others within the church, though, they treat homosexuality differently because they want to be loving. In recent years, anything that doesn't actively affirm a homosexual lifestyle is often called “hate,” and hate goes against everything a Christian is supposed to be. Besides, according to the popular narrative of the day, homosexuality is a predisposition that cannot, and even _should_ not, be fought. And if God makes someone that way, then surely God is OK with them behaving that way, right?  \n  \n  \n  \nAll such Christians have to do, then, is ignore the Bible. Disregard God’s Word, the very source of their hope. And ignore the fact that we’re all prone to sin; that there’s about as much evidence for genetic predispositions for alcoholism and violence as for homosexuality; and that if we can use predispositions and feelings as an excuse, then there is no sin and Jesus is not a Savior.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Christian Love**  \n  \nI fully agree that Christians should be loving (John 13:34-35). In fact, we should be the most loving group on the planet towards those in a homosexual lifestyle, or in any other lifestyle or situation you could name.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut I might lovingly disagree about how to do that.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Bible talks a lot about truth and love (Ephesians 4:15; 1 Corinthians 13:6; 1 John 3:18; 2 John 1:3; etc.). There’s a reason for that: you can’t really have love without truth. For example, if someone’s about to buy my old car and I know for a fact that the wheels are about to fall off, the loving thing to do would be to tell them the truth. It might cost me the sale, but it would save my integrity. Or if a friend is engaging in behavior that you know will cause harm to themselves or others around them, and they don’t seem to realize it, the loving thing to do would be to tell them the truth and try to save them that pain (Proverbs 27:6).  \n  \n  \n  \nSo if you want to truly be loving, you have to tell the truth. And here’s how you can do that.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Truth in Love**  \n  \nIf a friend is an unbeliever, and is a practicing homosexual, you tell them the truth:  \n  \n  \n  \nJesus loves them. He’s crazy about them. He loves them so much that He willingly died for them. The death was necessary because we all have sinned, and no sin is really any different: whether it’s a single lie or serial murder, any sin leaves us short of God’s standard of perfection. There’s nothing we can do to be “good enough,” but if we accept the free gift of Christ’s payment for our sins, we can lead a full life on earth and have eternal life with Him.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s good news; it’s true; and it’s the most loving thing you could possibly do for them.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd if you know a believer, someone you’re in community with, who is engaging in homosexual acts or struggling with _any_ sin, you tell them the truth:  \n  \n  \n  \nJesus loves them. He’s crazy about them. He still forgives them. He also wants what’s best for them. He can change them; they don’t have to be slaves to alcohol, drugs, pornography, heterosexual addiction, homosexual addiction, codependency, eating disorders, gambling, greed, or anything. None of those bring life, and He came to give you life to the full (John 10:10).  \n  \n  \n  \n**Love Change**  \n  \nThe chorus to Macklemore’s “Same Love” (sung by Mary Lambert) states:  \n  \n  \n  \n_I can't change_  \n  \n_Even if I tried_  \n  \n_Even if I wanted to_  \n  \n  \n  \nDefeatist as that may be, in a way it can be true. We sometimes don’t have the ability to change ourselves. But God does have the power to change us; to make us a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). I've seen it many times. I've seen it in my own life, where He took someone addicted to sex and pornography, a materialistic lover of money who came to church hung over from the night before, and turned me into a pastor. I may have some of the same predispositions, and still sin sometimes, but overall my life has seen a radical change.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis life is so short, though. Eternity’s very long. Whatever may happen or not happen in this life, the only thing that really matters is where you’ll spend eternity. And that’s not based on what you do, but what Christ did for you.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you have questions or want to hear more on this topic, check out last Tuesday’s podcast, [available here](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/365/) or on [The Porch App](http://get.theapp.co/a1a2).  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP (with help from Kevin McConaghy)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"truth-love-and-macklemore"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/truth-love-and-macklemore/"}}},

Before you can [make that decision](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-we-get-married/), there’s a lot you need to know about each other and a lot of questions to be answered.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat things should you discuss when dating? Such a list could be very long, but there are some things that stand out as more important than others:  \n  \n  \n\n  \n- **Beliefs.** This is first because it is the most important thing. You can have different hobbies or root for different football teams and still have the makings of a great marriage. But if you have a completely different view of how the world works and what you should be living for? That’s at the core of everything you do and everything you are. If you’re both fully committed to following Christ, you could pretty much make a relationship work regardless of your other differences. But if you’re not equally yoked, it’s hard to imagine ever achieving true oneness.\n  \n- **Finances.** Yeah, money is a big deal. But it’s not the amount of money we’re talking about here; it’s your attitudes towards how money should be stewarded. Arguments about how to manage money are consistently [cited](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/12/divorce-study_n_3587811.html) as the top reason why people get divorced. So, at some point in your dating relationship, you need to talk at length about how you’re going to handle earnings, savings, spending, and debt.\n  \n- **Family.** Your significant other’s family is important because they helped shape him or her into the person they are today. But they’re important for another reason as well: after marriage, they become your family, too. You’ll need to discuss the roles of in-laws, how you’ll handle holidays, and what your family traditions will look like after combining families.\n  \n- **Children.** Do you want to have children? If so, [how will you raise them](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-parenting-lessons-i-learned-from-young-adults/), and how will that affect your work and finances? It’s probably one of the more obvious premarital questions, but it’s a huge decision that definitely belongs on this list.\n  \n- **Goals.** What do you want to accomplish with your life? Where would you like to live? What things are most important to you? If one of you wants to live in an uptown high-rise and the other feels called to be a missionary in Haiti, that might not be the best match.\n  \n- **Divorce.** If you do get married, [is divorce ever an option](http://theporch.wpengine.com/divorce-and-reconciliation/)? The wedding vows state that you’ll stay together “for better or worse” and “till death do us part.” If that’s not your commitment level, then you shouldn’t take that vow. If anything—adultery, disability, financial problems, disagreements about leaving the toilet seat up—would cause either one of you to ever leave, you might as well write that into the vows. Or, you could truly commit to [love each other as Christ loves you](http://theporch.wpengine.com/jesus-crazy-talk-on-divorce/): always forgiving, always pursuing reconciliation and intimacy.\n  \n- **Expectations.** If you expect marriage to look a certain way, and your future spouse expects something different, one (or both) of you is going to end up disappointed. So, it’s important to talk through all your expectations and come to an agreement on how things are going to work. This includes everything from childcare and career decisions to whether or not you make the bed each morning. Watermark’s [Merge premarital class](http://theporch.wpengine.com/merge-dallas-premarital-class/) does a good job of helping you talk through all of the many expectations you might not even think about.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are married, what’s the most important thing you talked about (or wish you had talked about) before tying the knot?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP and Kevin McConaghy"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"7hULq8Cu9UmgmSWC8KOiAe"}}},"url":{"en-US":"seriously-dating-topics-of-discussion"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/seriously-dating-topics-of-discussion/"}}},

When you think about it, there’s a lot of debate about truth going on: disagreements about the meanings of words, the meaning of life, and what our laws should say about what’s right or wrong. Many people today even argue that there is no right and wrong, or that truth is relative. I specifically heard one speaker on the radio say that if there are 7 billion people in the world, there can be 7 billion “truths” about any particular question. I question whether he understands the difference in meaning between “truth” and “opinion,” but that’s what he said.  \n  \n  \n  \nTruth is an important concept to understand, though, because it can affect every part of how we live our lives and how we can best love others. So let’s clarify some basic truths about truth:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. There is such a thing as truth.**   \n  \nSome things are subjective. If I see a car and say that it’s expensive, that would be a subjective opinion. Someone else, probably with more money than I, might say the same car is cheap. It would be hard to prove that one person’s right or wrong.  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, if I say the car has a crack in its windshield, or that it is a Chevy, those things are not subjective. They’re either true, or they’re not. You see, some things (many things) actually are absolute, which means there is absolute truth.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. If something is true, that means that something else must be false.**  \n  \nIf I say the car is a Chevy, and someone else says it is a Ford, at least one of us must be wrong. We could both be wrong; it may be a Toyota. But the point is, there is a wrong answer. The fact that there is truth means that someone can, in fact, be wrong. (Knowing human nature, I’d say we’re all often wrong on a number of different things, both small and large.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Truth is not determined by what you feel or what you believe to be true, no matter how sincere that belief.**   \n  \nI have young kids, and they often say things like “Daddy, I’m a puppy” (or sometimes they just start crawling on all fours and barking). I don’t think they actually believe they’re dogs, but let’s say a human child did believe that. They’d be wrong. Even if they were raised by wolves, played a mean game of fetch, and were 100% certain they were born into a litter of St. Bernards, they still wouldn’t truly be dogs. They’d be humans convinced that they were dogs.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Truth is not determined by popular vote.**  \n  \nIt’s entirely possible for the majority to be wrong. And if something’s true, it’s still true even if not a single person believes it. At one point, most Europeans were certain that [tomatoes were poisonous](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-the-tomato-was-feared-in-europe-for-more-than-200-years-863735/?no-ist), and no one dared to try one and prove that wasn't the case. The lack of proof didn't prove that the truth wasn't true, and tomatoes didn't suddenly become edible when the majority decided that they were. They were always that way, even though that means most everybody was wrong. The truth didn't change; popular opinion did.  \n  \n  \n  \nNow, there are a few reasons why this all matters:  \n\n  \n- **Truth has consequences.** If someone misunderstands or simply ignores the truth, there is usually going to be some negative consequence of that. At one point, for example, most people thought that cigarettes were good for the health. They were even [recommended by doctors](http://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/news/print/hemonc-today/%7B241d62a7-fe6e-4c5b-9fed-a33cc6e4bd7c%7D/cigarettes-were-once-physician-tested-approved). People made choices based on a claim that was contrary to the truth, and the truth eventually caught up to many of them in the form of bad health and a shorter lifespan.\n  \n- **Truth informs how we can truly show love.** Christians are called to [love one another](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+13:34-35). Some people today think that means we shouldn't say anything when a Christian brother or sister believes something that isn't true (like the above example of believing that smoking is good for the health). It wouldn't be loving to reinforce that lie or encourage them to smoke more; in fact, it would make more sense if you did that to someone you hated. [The loving thing would be to tell them the truth](http://theporch.wpengine.com/truth-love-and-macklemore/), and offer to help them quit if they’re willing.\n  \n- **There is a truth about eternity.** Either there is such a thing as eternal life, or there isn't. Either Jesus paid the price so you can have eternal life, or He didn't. As I [talked about one Sunday](http://www.watermark.org/media/the-exclusivity-of-jesus/3100/), different religions (including atheism) all claim to be exclusive. That means only one of them can be true. But one of them _is_ true, and getting that particular truth straight is the most important thing you can do in life.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nIn the quote above, when Pilate “What is truth?” he was responding to this statement from Jesus:  \n  \n  \n  \n_The reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me. – John 18:37b_  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen faced with the question of what to make of Jesus, Pilate decided to simply not decide. He literally washed his hands of the matter (Matthew 27:24) and went along with the crowd. My goal is that everyone will at least hear and consider the evidence, of who Jesus is, what He did, and [why He chose to die](http://theporch.wpengine.com/losing-my-religion/), and make a decision.

[There is absolute truth](http://theporch.wpengine.com/4-truths-about-truth/). And if you’re a Christian, then the Bible provides clear instructions on what you should or shouldn’t do. (Christianity’s not about following rules, but the things that God calls “sin” should be avoided because they don’t lead to life, happiness, or God.)  \n  \n  \n  \nBut there are some things that aren’t quite as clear. Alcohol would be a classic example: it’s 100% clear that we shouldn’t become drunk (Ephesians 5:18), but it’s also clear that we have the freedom to drink moderately (1 Timothy 5:23)—except that some people struggle with alcoholism and can’t safely drink at all.  \n  \n  \n  \nSince the answer to “Can I have this drink?” depends on the situation and the people involved, you could possibly call that a gray area. The Bible does give us guidelines for how to handle such gray areas, and I keep a list of questions written down that I use to clarify whether something is a good idea or not.  \n  \n  \n  \n(I got this list of questions somewhere, but I don’t remember where. A Google search shows that they might have originally been put together by [John MacArthur](http://www.gty.org/resources/articles/a165/glorifying-god-in-gray-areas).)  \n  \n  \n  \n**Don’t do it if…**  \n  \nIf the answer to any one of these questions is “yes,” you shouldn’t do whatever it is you’re considering.\n\n  \n- **Will it have negative long-term consequences?** Two things immediately come to mind here. One is unwise and unaffordable debt, which can put you in financial bondage. The other is addiction, which is why some people are OK having a single drink (for example) while other people have to abstain. (1 Corinthians 6:12)\n  \n- **Could it harm my body (God’s temple)?** Anything that’s likely to bring bad health or disease should be avoided. Often this comes down to moderation: a cigar every once in a while might not be a problem, but cigars every day could lead to cancer or other ailments. For other things, like shooting up drugs, even once would be defiling. (1 Corinthians 6:19-20; Romans 6:13)\n  \n- **Will it give me a guilty conscience?** Basically, if you think something is wrong, don’t do it. For example, I know some people think it is a sin to drink any alcohol at all, even though the Bible doesn’t say that. If you take a drink while thinking that it’s wrong, that means you’re choosing to do what you think God has forbidden. You’re choosing to disobey, and that’s wrong. (Romans 14:23; 1 Corinthians 8:7)\n  \n- **Will it cause someone else to sin?** This is where we can lovingly sacrifice a little bit of our freedom to help our brothers and sisters. An example would be a friend who I know is a recovering alcoholic: I would choose not to drink when around him or her, so that there’s no temptation for them to join in. (1 Corinthians 8:9-13; Romans 13:10)\n  \n- **Will it hurt my witness?** We don’t want to hinder the spread of the gospel, and you never know who may be watching. As a believer, your life should stand out as different, but in a good way. (1 Corinthians 10:32-33; 1 Peter 3:15-17)\n  \n  \n  \n  \nIf the answer to all five of those questions is “no,” then it seems the action won’t cause any harm. It’s not clearly a bad idea. But is it a good idea?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Go ahead and do it if…**  \n  \nFor these questions, you’re looking for a “yes” answer:  \n\n  \n- **Will it benefit either myself or others?** Some things may not have a negative impact, but may not be positive, either. Preferably, you’d want to spend your time doing something beneficial. (1 Corinthians 10:23-24)\n  \n- **Will it bring glory to God?** Whatever you do, your goal should be to glorify God, not to glorify yourself. (1 Corinthians 10:31)\n  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you can answer “yes” to those questions, and “no” to the others, then the gray areas become pretty clear.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat gray area do you struggle with?  \n  \n  \n  \n– JP\n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n\n*Originally posted on October 13th, 2014*"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"2RmTpBdQbewsEuI2cs8yMk"}}},"url":{"en-US":"7-questions-to-ask-when-navigating-gray-areas"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/7-questions-to-ask-when-navigating-gray-areas/"}}},

The study looked at the correlation between divorce rates and wedding expenses (among other things).  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s worth a read, but what’s most interesting is looking at the numbers and considering what they really say. They hold some important insights for people who are [seriously dating](http://theporch.wpengine.com/seriously-dating-topics-of-discussion/) and considering putting a ring on it. Unsurprisingly, the results also seem to match up with what biblical wisdom says about dating and marriage.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo what do the numbers tell us? Below are the main takeaways.  \n  \n  \n  \n(In all of these, I’m talking about the numbers for the overall population after the researchers take into account all other variables, like income, age, race, etc. So you can read them as “all else being equal”: if two couples are otherwise identical, then their difference on this one issue makes them more or less likely to get a divorce.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. People who spend more on the wedding are more likely to divorce.**   \n  \nSpecifically, those who spend $20,000 or more are about 26% more likely to divorce than those who spend between $10k and $20k, and 55% more likely than couples who spend between $1k and $5k.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo why is this? The study doesn’t really look at the “why” (it’s correlation, not causation), but it does suggest the financial stress of wedding debt as a possibility. That makes sense, as debt is rarely a good idea, and is warned about in Scripture (Proverbs 22:7). If it’s being paid for by parents, though, it might have more to do with really wanting a wedding, and the marriage just being a side effect of that. Perhaps some people are focused more on preparing an impressive wedding than [preparing for the marriage that follows](http://theporch.wpengine.com/merge-dallas-premarital-class/).  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Couples who have more people attend the wedding are less likely to divorce.**  \n  \nIt probably shouldn’t be a surprise that weddings with no guests (only the couple) have the highest divorce rate; apparently what happens in Vegas doesn’t last. The divorce rate goes down 18% if you have 1-10 guests, 35% if you have 11-50 guests, 48% if you have 51-100 guests, and 58% if you have over 100.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhy? Well, at The Porch we always talk about the importance of [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/), and more people at the wedding can show that you have a community and family around you who support your decision to get married. And since “big” often equates to “expensive,” it suggests that couples who prioritize _celebrating_ with people rather than _impressing_ people have the right attitude towards weddings. (Romans 12:15)  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Honeymoons help.**  \n  \nHaving a honeymoon (of any kind) lowers the divorce rate by 13% compared to not having a honeymoon.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhy? I can only guess. Again, this is _after_ controlling for all other variables in the study (without controlling for variables, the number goes up to 36%). The study didn’t ask about whether couples [lived together before the wedding](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/), though, and I’ve seen articles suggest that people who already live together are less likely to take a traditional honeymoon. (No stats on that, but I do know of someone who went fishing with the guys _on his wedding night_ because he’d already been living with his new bride for years. Kind of takes the excitement out of the event.) Regardless, save money on your wedding so you can take a honeymoon. (Deuteronomy 24:5)  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Faith matters.**  \n  \nOr, at least, “religious attendance,” which is all the study asked about. Compared to “never” attending services, those who attend “regularly” are 38% less likely to get divorced. Interestingly, those who said they attend “sometimes” had a slightly higher divorce rate than those who “never” attend.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis goes against the common misconception that believers are just as likely to divorce as non-believers. Going to church regularly doesn’t guarantee that you’re a committed follower of Christ, but if you are, then you’re almost certainly in the “regularly” crowd. A couple that goes “sometimes” could possibly be lukewarm (Revelation 3:15-16), or perhaps only one of them is a believer (2 Corinthians 6:14).  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. It’s better to wait.**  \n  \nPeople who have children together are much less likely to divorce. But if you have kids together _before_ you tie the knot, your divorce rate is 70% higher than those who had their first kid together _after_ getting married.  \n  \n  \n  \nLet’s be clear: [the Bible says that sex should be saved for marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/). I know that might sound crazy to some people in today’s culture, but it’s true, [for a variety of reasons](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/). This would be one of those reasons. But, mistakes are made, and it’s always better to choose life: according to the study, people who have a child together out of wedlock and then get married are still 55% less likely to divorce than those who have no kids at all. (1 Corinthians 7:8-9; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-6)  \n  \n  \n  \n**6. Don’t focus on wealth.**  \n  \nIf people said that their partner’s wealth was important to them at the time of the proposal, they were 34% more likely to get divorced down the road. (For women who focused on wealth, the number goes up to 57%.)  \n  \n  \n  \nBasically: don’t be a gold-digger, and don’t marry one. (1 Timothy 6:10; Ecclesiastes 5:10)  \n  \n  \n  \n**7. Don’t focus on looks.**  \n  \nIf people said their partner’s looks were important to them at the time of the proposal, they were 29% more likely to divorce. (And that’s mostly on the guys’ side; for men who focused on looks, the number was 49%.)  \n  \n  \n  \nPeople age. As JP says, “We’re all getting uglier.” A lifelong commitment like marriage can’t be based on how she (or he) looks, because those looks will fade. It’s cliché, but you really should date and marry someone who is beautiful on the inside. (Proverbs 31:30)  \n  \n  \n  \nSome other takeaways from the study: people who “knew spouse very well” before getting married were much less likely to divorce (no surprise there), and [dating longer before proposing](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-long-should-you-date-before-marriage/) helped with that. And though many articles focused on how the cost of the engagement ring affected things, the numbers there aren’t that clear. I’d say be wise and ask your community for advice when ring shopping.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor those who are married: is there anything about your wedding or dating decisions that you wish you’d done differently?"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"5LHb0Kq1JmAY8qEAIogoey"}}},"url":{"en-US":"7-wedding-wisdom-stats-for-singles"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/7-wedding-wisdom-stats-for-singles/"}}},

All year my parents would put restrictions around eating candy, and warning me against cavities and tooth decay. Then Halloween would come! It was like a free pass one day a year to eat more candy than anyone should. The rules would go out the window!  \n  \n  \n  \nThe second best part of Halloween was dressing up. I distinctly remember, when I was 8, dressing up as David (with a robe and a sling) and thinking I was a shoo-in for the costume contest at my Catholic school. I was quite confused when a witch won instead. C’mon! I was a Bible character and nuns were judging! A witch?! Really?!  \n  \n  \n  \nI eventually outgrew the idea of Halloween costumes like everyone else I knew. As a teen, Halloween was childish. It wasn’t cool at all.  \n  \n  \n  \nThen, at some point, it became a thing again to get dressed up and go partying on Halloween. This time the annual free pass wasn’t candy; it was sin. There is a hit horror movie, _The Purge_, where one day a year everyone can get away with any crime they want. Halloween seems to be that in regards to modesty. People, even “Christians,” take it as permission to sin by showing off our bodies and/or indulging in others who do the same. I haven’t seen _The Purge,_ but I’ve seen many young adults look for that occasional permission to indulge the desires of their flesh.  \n  \n  \n  \n**“Adult” Costumes**  \n  \nThis isn’t a post about how Halloween is evil, or [demonic](http://theporch.wpengine.com/halloween-and-demons/). Halloween is what you make of it. As I said, for kids, that usually means it’s a fun way to get lots of free candy.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor many adults, though, it seems to be more about eye candy.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s a trend that was highlighted (and made fun of) by a Subway TV commercial in which a woman said she had to stay in shape for all the revealing Halloween costumes, like “attractive nurse,” “spicy Red Riding Hood,” and “foxy fullback.” A radio ad I heard (unrelated to Subway) joked about how all the costume choices were, let’s say, “sexy” (the word they actually used was “slutty”). Instead of just a firefighter costume, it was a “sexy” firefighter. Instead of a gorilla, it was a “sexy” gorilla.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo what’s the problem with that? Well, there are a couple of things I can think of.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Sexy Children?**  \n  \nFirst, there seems to be a trickle-down effect when it comes to children’s Halloween costumes. I don’t know if it’s because kids want to copy the costumes they see on adults, or because the costume makers find it easier to just scale down their sizes. All I know is that I’ve seen some children’s costumes that start to mirror the “sexy” costumes common among adults. Which is disturbing, because there is no circumstance under which a child should be associated with “sexy.” My 5-year-old will not be a burlesque dancer or a French Maid for Halloween, and I’m sad to see those as options in the costume aisle.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Christian Choices**  \n  \nIt doesn’t surprise me when adult nonbelievers dress in revealing costumes, or go to parties where that is celebrated. Before I understood what Jesus had done for me, I did the same. I remember the unofficial contest among women of who could “dress up” wearing the least. I recall one Halloween event at a club in Uptown where girls' tops were simply painted. That's right: their costume was paint.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut Jesus changed me, I repented, and that’s not where you’ll find me these days. See, it’s a different matter when you say you’re a Christian, and claim that Jesus is the Lord of your life. Because Jesus says that lusting after someone who is not your spouse is a sin (Matthew 5:28). It’s also not exactly loving to cause or encourage someone to sin in this way (1 Corinthians 8:9; Mark 9:42), and we’re asked to dress modestly (1 Timothy 2:9).  \n  \n  \n  \nMost days, most people do [dress modestly](http://theporch.wpengine.com/modesty-turning-the-tables/), and don’t go to naked-and-painted clubs. But it seems like on Halloween we “purge.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**How to Choose**  \n  \nI’m not saying you can’t wear costumes on Halloween or go to parties with friends. I’m just encouraging some [common sense](http://theporch.wpengine.com/7-questions-to-ask-when-navigating-gray-areas/). You want to dress up as a police officer? Great! But in case you haven’t noticed, police uniforms don’t actually include miniskirts and bare midriffs.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat’s sad is that we’re to the point where, particularly for women, it can be hard to find costumes that _aren’t_ focused on being “sexy.” Subway was accused of being sexist for their commercial, but I’d say they were just reflecting reality. A reality we should seek to change.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, you may have to get creative. You may feel like you’ll stand out because you’re not scantily dressed, and everyone else is. To which I’d say: perhaps you’re supposed to stand out. Maybe this is a chance to set a good example for younger girls, or witness to friends that there is a different way.  \n  \n  \n  \nBesides, it’s Halloween. It’s not like you want to dress just like everyone else.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat are you doing for Halloween?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"should-christian-adults-dress-up-on-halloween"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/should-christian-adults-dress-up-on-halloween/"}}},

And I know that the majority of people in that age group don’t vote in your average election. For a so-called midterm election, like this one, more than 75% of people age 18-29 don’t vote (according to the Washington Post). Most likely, 3 out of 4 people at The Porch aren’t planning to vote in this election.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd that is scary, because so much rides on this and every election. We need people to vote who are wise, informed by God’s Word, and who value freedom.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Land of the Free**  \n  \nThat’s what America is known as, or has been called in the past.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut what makes it free?  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s not that we’re free to do absolutely anything and everything, because there are laws against some things—laws set up by people in the government.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou could say it’s free because the Constitution, and specifically the Bill of Rights, spells out our most important freedoms. However, those freedoms are subject to interpretation by the courts, and only apply in the way that human judges say they should. And when even the definition of words like “person,” “life,” and “speech” is considered up for debate, it becomes surprisingly easy to lose those freedoms.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen you get down to it, what really makes it a “free” country is that we are free to choose who will rule over it. We have the power to decide who will set, interpret, and enforce the laws of the land.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd that’s why voting is so important. It’s the one true freedom we have.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Every Election Matters**  \n  \nIn recent years, almost twice as many young adults have voted in Presidential elections as in mid-term elections. That’s still generally under 50% who vote when the Oval Office is up for grabs, which is sad, but it’s better than the 25% or fewer who vote in elections like this one.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo in case you don’t know: there are _a lot_ of positions and policies on the ballot, even in non-Presidential years. And they are things that matter.  \n  \n  \n  \nDo you care about how our laws and rights are interpreted by the courts? Well, guess who’s on the ballot: lots of judges, plus the District Attorney and Attorney General.  \n  \n  \n  \nU.S. Senators and Congressmen are also up for a vote, and last I checked, they collectively have just as much power as the President. They also approve federal judges, which gives you an indirect vote on the Supreme Court.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe state has its own set of laws, and our top statewide offices are also on the ballot this Tuesday. And in case you think that local laws and local politicians aren’t that big a deal, recent events in Houston should serve as a reminder that you need a voice in all levels of government.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Every Vote Counts**  \n  \nHere’s the thing about people not voting: it means that a small number of people can decide the course for everyone.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou don’t have to look too hard for examples. Last mid-term, one local state representative won by 202 votes. Less than one-tenth of the people at The Porch on Tuesday—like one person from every row—would have been enough to change that outcome, if they wanted. Many elections were decided by fewer than the number of people who regularly read this blog.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, again: go vote. The first Tuesday in November, which at the time of this publishing happens to be tomorrow. Of course, first make sure who or what you want to vote for; you can find online guides that rate candidates on important issues ([like this one for Texas](http://freevotersguide.com)).  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd if it seems like the choice is between the lesser of two evils? Then yes, vote for the lesser of two evils. (You don’t want to be stuck with the _worse_ evil, do you?) And then, next time, get involved earlier in the process and work to make sure you have a good option on the ballot.  \n  \n  \n  \nGo vote on Tuesday, and then join us at [The Porch](http://theporch.wpengine.com) for a new series ([via app](http://get.theapp.co/a1a2), if you’re not in Dallas or [Fort Worth](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-porch-fort-worth/)).  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"why-you-should-vote"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-you-should-vote/"}}},

And we tried to limit it to ideas that weren’t that expensive ($15 or less per person) since we are also proponents of [good financial stewardship](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-stewardship-challenge/). We came up with 14 ideas, but feel free to add your own in the comments at the end.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Less Than 15 Dallas Date Ideas for Less Than $15**  \n  \n**1.**  **Klyde Warren Park**  \n[This downtown/arts district park](http://www.klydewarrenpark.org/) has quickly become one of the most popular cool spots in Dallas. Yes, it’s a park—and is built on top of a highway—but it has food trucks, a restaurant, wifi, a dog park, a reading area stocked with reading materials, chess, croquet, ping pong, a putting green, and petanque (whatever that is). And the price is right: everything but the food is free.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. The Dallas Museum of Art**  \nRight next to Klyde Warren Park is [the DMA](http://www.dma.org/), which is now also free all the time (except for special exhibits). It normally closes at 5 p.m., except for Thursday evenings and the [Late Nights](http://www.dma.org/programs/late-nights) on the third Friday of every month (which is also this Friday). During Late Nights you can also check out the [Nasher Sculpture Center](http://www.nashersculpturecenter.org) next door for free, and the [Crow Collection of Asian Art](http://crowcollection.org) right next to that. All are open until midnight on third Fridays.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Fort Worth Museum District**  \nOn the FW side of DFW, Fort Worth has its own collection of art museums. [The Amon Carter Museum of American Art](http://www.cartermuseum.org) and the [Kimbell Art Museum](https://www.kimbellart.org) are both free and well worth a visit. Next to the Kimbell is the [Modern Art Musuem of Fort Worth](http://themodern.org), which costs $10, but is free on the first Sunday of every month. Next to the Amon Carter is the [National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame](http://www.cowgirl.net), which is also $10.  \n  \n**4. Fort Worth Zoo**  \nOK, so there’s both the [Dallas Zoo](http://www.dallaszoo.com) and the [Fort Worth Zoo](http://www.fortworthzoo.org) to choose from, but most people seem to agree that the one in Fort Worth is the better of the two. Admission is $12. You may think of the zoo as a place for kids, but an unscientific poll of two grown women showed that they both thought it was a great date idea.  \n  \n**5. Fort Worth Stockyards**  \nReal cowboys might scoff at its touristy nature, but for city slickers [the Stockyards](http://www.fortworthstockyards.org/Index.aspx) do allow you to see cattle drives, gunfights, and wild west shows, while browsing through blocks of western-themed shops. There is also a [rodeo every Friday and Saturday night](http://stockyardsrodeo.com), though that will cost you a whopping $17.50. (During the summers on the opposite side of the Metroplex, you can attend the [Mesquite Rodeo](http://www.mesquiterodeo.com/) any Friday or Saturday night for $14.)  \n  \n**6. White Rock Lake**  \nThe lake, and the park and 9-mile trail that surrounds it, is a good place to watch a sunset, have a picnic, go for a walk, or (for the athletic/outdoorsy types) go running, biking, or roller blading. [Kayaks can be rented](http://www.whiterockpaddle.com) for $14.99 an hour, or a two-seater canoe for $10 per person.  \n  \n**7. Dallas Arboretum**  \nGirls love flowers, and the [Arboretum](http://www.dallasarboretum.org) has 66 acres of them. Hard to go wrong here, guys, as long as the weather is nice. Tickets for non-members are normally $15. _Right now through January 4th they have the 12 Days of Christmas exhibit!_   \n  \n  \n  \n**8. Movies at**  **Valley View AMC**  \nThere are plenty of movie theaters around, including multiple AMCs, so why list this one? [Because it’s cheap](https://www.amctheatres.com/movie-theatres/amc-valley-view-16#19523). All movies are $6 unless they start before 4 p.m., in which case it’s only $4. And yes, these are first-run movies; the same as the ones you would pay twice as much for at the NorthPark AMC. NorthPark is a million times better mall than Valley View, but the theaters aren’t really that different.  \n  \n  \n  \nOr, with a little drive, a much more creative movie option is…  \n  \n  \n  \n**9. Galaxy Drive-In Theater**  \nAbout 30 miles south of downtown Dallas, where it gets dark enough to actually project movies outside, there is the six-screen [Galaxy Drive-In Theater](http://www.galaxydriveintheatre.com). Tickets there are also $6, but for that you get two movies (a double-feature) and a neat 1950s vibe.  \n  \n  \n  \n**10. Plaza Theatre Company**  \nStarting from downtown Fort Worth instead, head 30 miles south to Cleburne and you can watch a live play at the [Plaza Theatre Company](http://plaza-theatre.com). They have shows every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evening, as well as a Saturday afternoon matinee. It’s a theatre in the round, which means any seat is a good seat and you’re way up close to the action (you can’t stick your feet out in the front row because you might trip one of the actors).  \n  \n  \n  \n**11. Shakespeare in the Park**  \nDuring the summer, you can catch some outdoor theater with [Shakespeare in the Park](http://www.shakespearedallas.org) at the Samuell Grand Amphitheatre. Oddly enough, some of the shows are not actually by Shakespeare. Tickets are $10 each.  \n  \n  \n  \n**12. North Texas Outdoor Pursuit Center**  \nFor a little more real-life drama, you can try your hand at the 120-foot indoor rock climbing walls at Carrolton’s [North Texas Outdoor Pursuit Center](http://www.northtexasopc.com). If you can make sense of their daily specials, you can get your climb on for $8 - $15 per person. There are other local rock climbing gyms as well, but this is the only one built inside an old grain elevator, and therefore taller than a 10-story building.  \n  \n  \n  \n**13. McKinney Square**  \nHistoric downtown McKinney features [Second Saturdays](http://www.mckinneytexas.org/index.aspx?NID=564), which is a time to explore the local shops, art galleries, and restaurants. (No, not [that 2<sup>nd</sup> Saturday](https://www.facebook.com/2ndSaturdayorg), though that would be a creative way to serve together as a couple—and since they occur at different times of the day, you could do both.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**14. The Porch**  \nOK, so not a traditional date idea, but it is the place to be on Tuesday evenings. Outside of Tuesdays, we regularly have events that include sand volleyball, roller skating, baseball games, bowling and more! It’s a way to date in community, the same way that dates used to happen on the front porch where the family and community could see. We’ll let you know about events when we meet on Tuesdays, and you can also check [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/theporchdallas) for invites.  \n  \n_\\*[The Porch is on break until January 27th, 2015](http://theporch.wpengine.com/porch-on-break/), but we hope some of these date ideas are helpful for over the holidays!_   \n  \n  \n  \nWhat’s your favorite date idea in or around DFW?  \n  \n  \n  \n_Photo credit: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xvisionx\\_Dallas\\_Stemmons.jpg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xvisionx_Dallas_Stemmons.jpg)_\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"top-post-of-2014-5-dallas-dates-for-less-than-15"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/top-post-of-2014-5-dallas-dates-for-less-than-15/"}}},

Except there was no “trip” involved. They didn’t go to Africa, or some unreached corner of the Amazon rain forest. They didn’t even leave town. They just went out among their peers in Dallas and talked with them about the gospel.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou might wonder why. I mean, Dallas is in the Bible belt of America, which some people call a Christian nation. So surely everyone already knows the gospel, right?  \n  \n  \n  \nBut you might be surprised. In fact, some of you who even call yourself “Christian” may be shocked to learn that _you_ haven’t even heard the gospel, or at least not understood it before now. I know that’s how it was for me for much of my life.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Gospel vs. Religion**  \n  \nI grew up a religious kid. Very much so, as I even went to a religious school and there won the “religion award” X years in a row.  \n  \n  \n  \nEvery religion in the world revolves around what you have to do to get on God’s good side, or be made right with Him. It’s about _doing_ something to earn God’s favor, to be seen as worthy or “good enough” or somehow pay for the mistakes you’ve made. Depending on the religion, it might involve ritual sacrifice, penance, pilgrimages, cleansings, rituals, or simply following a long list of rules. It’s about getting what you deserve, and trying real hard so that you deserve something better.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd that’s what I thought it was all about. Following rules. Doing good, or at least not doing anything bad.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe problem was that I couldn’t always keep the rules. Couldn’t, or (especially as I grew older) didn’t really want to. Chose not to. My way seemed more fun.  \n  \n  \n  \nUnfortunately, according to the rules of religion, that meant I would have been toast. Destined for some kind of punishment.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut that’s before I heard and finally understood the gospel.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Good News**  \n  \n“Gospel” means “good news,” and for good reason.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs I had experienced myself, there was a limit to how “good” anyone can be. Nobody’s perfect, and most people really aren’t that close. That might be OK if God graded on a curve, but the standard is perfection. Sin even once, and you really don’t deserve the reward of an eternal paradise (Romans 5:8). There’s nothing you can do to make up for it or pay for your mistakes, since all you own and every ability you have is a gift from God in the first place. You’d just be giving God back His stuff; it wouldn’t buy you anything.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s where religion breaks down. And it’s where Jesus comes in.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe punishment for any sin is death (Romans 6:23), or lack of life. That’s the bad news. That’s the sentence we’re all under. The reason Jesus came, the reason He became a human and lived and died, was to take that consequence for us. As God’s Son, Jesus was the only person who never did sin, and who never had to die (2 Corinthians 5:21). So when He did die, in a public execution, he took on our punishment. He took our place and paid our price (Romans 5:28). And to further prove that He has power over death, He later [rose from the grave](http://theporch.wpengine.com/resurrection/).  \n  \n  \n  \nSo what do you have to do to be saved from death and “earn” eternal life? Jesus has already done it. It’s a free gift, already paid for. You just have to accept the gift. “If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9).  \n  \n  \n  \nSuch an everything-for-nothing exchange can sound too good to be true, and that’s one reason why many people have a hard time accepting it. But that’s what an infinitely loving and good God would do.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you want to do good works, great! This broken world could use your help. Just don’t make the mistake, as many do, of thinking you can do enough to earn your way to heaven. And you’d do well to avoid sin, because there are [consequences](http://theporch.wpengine.com/getting-away-with-it/) you can avoid in this life. But such mistakes don’t separate you from God’s love, because Jesus has already paid the price to forgive you.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s good news! And that’s why 100 of my friends went out last week to tell everyone they could, and serve complete strangers to demonstrate the love they’ve been shown. It’s the same reason I’m telling it now, in writing, so that as many people as possible can hear the news that changed my life and changed my eternity.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf your life has likewise been changed by the truth of the gospel, [tell others](http://theporch.wpengine.com/evangelism-works-vs-words/).  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you have questions and would like to talk with someone about it, tell us. You can [contact us here](http://theporch.wpengine.com/contact-us/), through email at [theporch@watermark.org](mailto:theporch@watermark.org), or by commenting below.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"the-gospel"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-gospel/"}}},

A missionary is not a title reserved for believers who live in a foreign country. Rather, we are all on a life-long mission trip, and every day is a short-term mission opportunity. For some who call Watermark Church their home the opportunity to be on mission will include being part of our efforts “to go and be the church” in other parts of the world  \n  \n**A Servant-Partnership Approach**  \n  \nWatermark uses a multi-layered approach to help reach the nations as we deploy our members in Haiti, Ethiopia, Central Africa, and the Middle East where their gifts and talents can best be used to serve our various partners. Just as we do locally, internationally we pursue partnerships with indigenous ministries that are effectively impacting their own culture and country by helping transform the lives of people where the ministry serves through evangelism, service, and teaching.  \n  \nOur goal in serving internationally is to help our partners develop people and processes focused on biblical principles that will do more than provide relief of short-term physical needs such as water, food, or education. Instead, our most important goal in serving internationally is make sure the “why” is always shared with the “what” so the Good News of Jesus Christ is always connected to our good works (Ephesians 2:8-10).  \n  \n**How You Can Get Involved**  \n  \nWatermark's External Focus staff coordinates a variety of short-term Discipleship Trips. These trips allow our body to use their time, talent, and treasures God has given us to serve our partners in a manner that best meets the partner’s needs (Romans 10:9-15). We also offer our body the opportunity to be involved in these efforts from home through financial support, prayers, and engagement in specific projects unique to each partner. Regardless of where the service is done or what service it is, we see international involvement as a chance to disciple our own people, even as we seek to impact others.  \n  \nSo how can you get involved in Watermark’s international efforts?  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. First download and read the handouts listed below with links to them.\n  \n2. Pray and talk to your community group about applying to be part of Watermark Short Term Discipleship.\n  \n3. Fill out the application for the trip you’re interested in.\n  \n4. Email or drop off your application to the External Focus team for Haiti trips or to the Young Adult leadership with E3 for Ethiopia trips.\n  \n5. If you want to get involved in other ways please go to [www.watermark.org/international](http://www.watermark.org/international/) for information all our efforts.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nEthiopia has an application deadline for the summer 2015 trips. Haiti has more of a “first come, first serve” application schedule because trips are scheduled throughout the year. The application doesn't commit you to go, but it does let us know that you're definitely interested!  \n  \n  \n\n  \n- “Everything You Need to Know” handout – read this first: [http://bit.ly/ZHL8dx](http://bit.ly/ZHL8dx)\n  \n- Haiti Info handout: [http://bit.ly/1vn6HMY](http://bit.ly/1vn6HMY)\n  \n- Ethiopia Info handout: [http://bit.ly/1wPJwsX](http://bit.ly/1wPJwsX)\n  \n- Haiti Application: [http://bit.ly/1vEtdlJ](http://bit.ly/1vEtdlJ)\n  \n- Ethiopia Application: [http://svy.mk/1Dioes7](http://svy.mk/1Dioes7)\n  \n- Haiti FAMILY Trip Application (in case that applies): [http://bit.ly/1Dipmfa](http://bit.ly/1Dipmfa)\n  \n  \nPlease feel free to contact our External Focus Team with questions about any of these or other opportunities: [externalfocus@watermark.org](mailto:externalfocus@watermark.org).  \n  \n_ **Surrendered to God we are changing the world though the lives of young adults.** _  \n  \nOn behalf of the Young Adults and External Focus teams"},"url":{"en-US":"if-we-dont-go-who-will"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/if-we-dont-go-who-will/"}}},

I’m talking about people who would really like to have a merry Christmas, but don’t. And though some may be genuinely disappointed that they didn’t get the Red Ryder BB gun they wanted, for most adults a blue Christmas comes from lacking the loving family environment they long for.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Home Alone**  \n  \nAs children, most people do have some kind of family to spend the holidays with. And in the past, most people got married soon after leaving home and started families of their own.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s not really the case today, since only [one in four](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/) Millennials (adults under age 33) are married, and those who do get married are tying the knot later in life ([6 years later](http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/16349065/are-millenials-balking-at-marriage), on average, than our grandparents’ generation).  \n  \n  \n  \nSince this generation is also more likely to come from broken homes,that means the holidays often don’t resemble the ideal family get-together. Important people may be missing from the picture, or you may not have anyone to spend Christmas with at all.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas**  \n  \nSo what do you do if your Christmas doesn’t bring you any cheer? A few thoughts:\n\n  \n- **Don’t compare yourself to others.** Comparison is the thief of joy. It keeps us from being happy with what we have, because you can always find someone who appears to have more. Social media doesn’t help, as people generally only post things that paint their lives in a good light. Remember, appearances are deceiving.\n  \n- **Have realistic expectations.** Disappointment comes from unmet expectations. Don’t expect to have a perfect Christmas, since that never really happens. It doesn’t have to be perfect to be enjoyable. And there’s no rule saying that your Christmas must look a certain way, with a “traditional” tree and lights and presents and eggnog. You are free to set your own traditions.\n  \n- **Remember the point of it all.** Christmas is a celebration of the fact that we have a God who loves us enough to pursue us, so that we never have to be truly alone. He sent His Son to pay for the sins of our broken world, so that we can have life and be together eternally (John 3:16).\n  \n- **Celebrate with your forever family.** It’s not good to be alone (Genesis 2:18). That doesn’t mean you can’t spend some time by yourself; for some people, spending a quiet day alone could be the most refreshing gift they could get. But we shouldn’t be unknown and without anyone who loves us. If you don’t have that from your biological or legal family, remember that all believers are adopted into the same family (Matthew 12:48-50; Romans 12:5). That’s one of the reasons we emphasize [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/community/): so you have others who will love you and look out for you. Get together with some of them for the holidays.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nOn that last point, I would encourage those who do have a holiday celebration planned to proactively invite anyone they’re in community with who doesn’t have a place to go. It’s simply more welcoming and loving that way, rather than the individual trying to invite himself or herself over. If you’re the one who is alone for the holidays, your responsibility is to be open and honest with your community about your situation and how you feel, so that they know you would appreciate help.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you don’t have that kind of biblical community around you, [we'd love to help you change that](https://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/community).  \n  \n  \n  \nHow do you celebrate Christmas?  \n  \n  \n  \n– JP \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"4NBCbHfFTiYAgoagueseE6"}}},"url":{"en-US":"alone-for-the-holidays"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/alone-for-the-holidays/"}}},

Men were willing to follow him even before he was king, and even when he was on the run and had to hide in the desert. God referred to him as “a man after my own heart” (Acts 13:22), which is some of the highest praise anyone gets in the Bible.  \n  \n  \n  \nThough no one reading this (other than you, [William](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge)) will ever have a chance to be king, we do have opportunities to lead in different ways. And after looking at David’s life for [a talk on the whole Goliath incident](http://www.watermark.org/media/the-answer-to-why-is-who/3262/), I noticed several ways in which his story shows us what we need to be God’s kind of leader—a man after God’s own heart.  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. To be God’s leader requires PATIENCE.**  \n  \nDavid was anointed as Israel’s king when he was a boy, probably in his early teens. But he was 30 before becoming king of Judah (which was just part of Israel) and 37 before he was named king of all Israel, as promised.  \n  \n  \n  \nHaving to wait a couple of decades for something you’ve been promised, that’s rightfully yours, is hard enough. But the existing king, Saul, spent a fair portion of that time trying to kill David. This forced him to stay on the run, hiding in caves and fleeing to another country. At least twice, David had a clear opportunity to kill Saul, and considering the circumstances it could have been considered self-defense. But David didn’t. He knew that God was in control, and trusted Him enough to wait on His timing.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord._  \n_- David (Psalm 27:14)_  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. To be God’s leader requires HUMILITY.**  \n  \nSo you’re a lowly shepherd boy, and you’re chosen as king by the guy who’s in charge of such things. What do you do?  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you’re David, you go back to taking care of sheep.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen he does get called up to the palace, instead of demanding the throne, he works as a servant. He performs music for the king whenever Saul demands it, like a human iPod.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen his dad asks the anointed king to serve snacks to his older brothers, he serves snacks to his older brothers.  \n  \n  \n  \nDavid was humble. He knew that, even as king, he was still just a servant of the King of kings and the Lord of lords.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Who am I, Sovereign Lord, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?_  \n_- David (2 Samuel 7:18)_  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. To be God’s leader requires COURAGE.**  \n  \nWhen Goliath came out to challenge the army of Israel, everyone was afraid of the 9-foot giant. Besides being king, Saul was a head taller than any other Israelite (1 Samuel 9:2). So when the giant Goliath came out to challenge the army of Israel, I’m sure people were looking to him to do something. Instead, he was “dismayed and terrified” (1 Samuel 17:11), just like everyone else.  \n  \n  \n  \nExcept for David. The kid brother ends up comforting the scared king, assuring Saul that he’d take care of it (1 Samuel 17:32). And you probably know what happens next.  \n  \n  \n  \nDavid was brave because he knew Who had his back. If you’re on God’s side, then there is nothing to fear—not even death.  \n  \n  \n  \nThough our giants might look different today, there is definitely still evil in the world that we need to stand up against. We need not be afraid if our hope is in the Ruler of the universe.  \n  \n  \n  \n_The Lord is my light and my salvation—whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life—of whom shall I be afraid?_  \n_- David (Psalm 27:1)_  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. To be God’s leader requires FAITH.**  \n  \nThroughout all of this, David showed that he had faith in God. He believed that God was in control. God had promised that David would be king, and since he wasn’t king yet, that meant Saul _couldn’t_ kill him. Same with Goliath. When others brought up doubts, David pointed to evidence of how God had taken care of him in the past (1 Samuel 17:33-37). He trusted that God would continue to keep His promises.  \n  \n  \n  \n_But I trust in you, Lord; I say, “You are my God.” My times are in your hands; deliver me from the hands of my enemies, from those who pursue me._  \n_- David (Psalm 31:14-15)_  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. To be God’s leader requires GRACE.**  \n  \nPerhaps the most surprising thing about David being “a man after (God’s) own heart” is that he’s just as well-known for his mistakes as his successes. This is someone who slept with the wife of one of his friends, tried to cover up the resulting pregnancy, and had the husband killed when that cover-up didn’t work. He abused his power at times, wasn’t known as a great father or husband, and would sometimes lie when it suit his purposes.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhy would God have anything to do with a lying, adulterous murderer? Really, it says more about God’s character than David’s. The one thing David did was recognize when he was wrong and repent. Check out Psalm 51 for one particular instance of him doing so.  \n  \n  \n  \nBeing a good leader doesn’t mean making the fewest mistakes; it means being open about them and being quick to ask forgiveness and get back on the right path.  \n  \n  \n  \n_I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, Lord, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing._  \n_- David (2 Samuel 24:10)_  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat do you think makes a great leader?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)\n\n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"3Uf29nBJCM4Q4oAWOAak4s"}}},"url":{"en-US":"5-leadership-lessons-from-king-david"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/5-leadership-lessons-from-king-david/"}}},

Call them New Year’s solutions, if you want.  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Unclutter your life.**  \n  \nThere are things that take up unnecessary space in your life. You need to identify them and remove them.  \n  \n  \n  \nLet me give you a few examples of what I’m talking about. I do a lot of my Christmas shopping online. In doing so, I unknowingly sign up for a lot of email marketing spam. Every day around this time of year I wake up to about a dozen emails that are simply telling me of coupons, Groupons, discounts, and sales. So, in uncluttering my life, I take 5 minutes to “unsubscribe” from each of them by finding the tiny link at the bottom of all these emails.  \n  \n  \n  \nI also clean out my closet and our garage and give away everything that I haven’t used lately. I’ve heard one thing you can do at the beginning of the year is to turn all your clothes hangers around (facing the other, awkward direction). When you wear something and then hang it back up, you naturally turn it around. At the end of the year you give away all of the clothes that are still hanging backwards, and therefore haven’t been worn in the past 12 months. You clearly don’t need them.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow is your life cluttered, and how can you create space?  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Create a spot.**   \n  \nSpecifically, a quiet spot to do your quiet time.  \n  \n  \n  \nIs your New Year’s resolution to read your Bible more? Start with finding a spot that you will go to every day. I have a desk near my bed with a heater near it (because it’s hard to get out of bed when its cold). It has a wide-margin Bible (so I can take notes) chained to it. (Literally, the Bible is tied to the desk so I don’t move it.) I have a single-serve French press coffee maker on it with a kettle that I prepare every evening. This is my spot. It is where I start my day right, every day. No breakfast or business meeting until I’ve had my Bible first.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhere will you read it? Find a spot.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Choose a bedtime.**  \n  \nObedience doesn’t start with getting up on time. Obedience starts with going to bed on time.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow early do you need to wake up in order to visit your spot before your earliest meeting? Got the time in mind? (4 am? 5 am? 6 am?) OK, now back up 8 hours and you have your bedtime.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is where a healthy habit of starting your day right starts: ending your previous day on time.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Choose a plan.**  \n  \nSix months from now, I don’t want you to wake up and wonder what to read. Decide now. Find a reading plan.  \n  \n  \n  \nI will be reading [The Journey](http://jointhejourney.com).

Clutter your life with reminders.**  \n  \nThat is to say, clutter your life with the right things.  \n  \n  \n  \nI may unsubscribe from a lot of things, but I still get my Join The Journey email every morning. I still get a daily verse and reflection. I still get my [American Prayer Initiative](http://americanprayerinitiative.org) email every morning. I may get rid of a lot of unused material goods, but I still have Bibles everywhere (my truck, my desk, my backpack).  \n  \n  \n  \nWhy? Because I’m hardheaded and often get distracted. I want to literally trip over God’s Word everywhere. Reading something in the morning is not enough for me. I need reminders everywhere that I can reference at any time of need. I’m not saying you need to go invest in a bunch of Bibles. (I hope you have invested in one; if not, we’ll give one to you!) I am saying it’s a good idea to be surrounded by reminders to focus on what is truly important.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat tips do you have for simple ways to change your life in 2015?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)"},"url":{"en-US":"choose-a-plan"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/choose-a-plan/"}}},

My answer is that they should absolutely break up, because clearly they do not yet have the spiritual maturity to be attracted to the things that God is attracted to (1 Samuel 16:7). Until it is possible to commit to cherishing that person for a lifetime, breaking up is the best option. But it’s more an issue of their own spiritual maturity, not of their significant other’s physique. I don't say that to shame them, but I get the sense that as The Holy Spirit continues to conform us to Christ we will eventually see people as God does.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat brings up another common dating question, continuing the theme from [last week](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-girls-ask-guys-out/):  \n  \n  \n  \n**How important is physical attraction when choosing a spouse?**  \n  \nProbably less important than you think.  \n  \n  \n  \nI say that because, in dating, physical attractiveness is often at or near the top of the list of what people are looking for. Some people won’t admit that it’s a major factor, because that might make them seem shallow. But, it is likely still the first thing you consider when meeting someone and deciding whether you might be interested in dating them.  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, in marriage, physical beauty is far from being the most important thing.  \n  \n  \n  \nLet me put it this way: there are a lot of [traits that are important](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-man-should-look-for-in-a-woman/) to [look for in a spouse](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-woman-should-look-for-in-a-man/). Those traits will contribute to your happiness in marriage. Nobody’s perfect; your spouse will be stronger on some traits than others.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, let’s say you had to choose between traits. On one hand you could have a spouse who was knock-out gorgeous, but critical and quick to argue or nitpick about anything. On the other hand you could have a spouse who was always kind and quick to forgive, but was just so-so physically. Ask anyone who’s married, and they’ll tell you that kindness and forgiveness are more important to your happiness than physical looks. You won’t be happy with the quarrelsome spouse, no matter how physically attractive they are. Here’s the point: good looks, while nice to have, are the less important trait. (See also Proverbs 21:9, 21:19, 27:15, and really the whole book.)  \n  \n  \n  \nThen there’s the other big problem with looks: they don’t last (Proverbs 31:30). Someone who is beautiful today will be a little less beautiful 5 years from now, and less beautiful than that 10 years from now, and so on, until we’re all old men and women. Now, there is a wonderful thing in marriage where your spouse can appear more beautiful to you over time, but objectively speaking, we’re all getting uglier. So if someone’s focused solely on physical beauty, they’ll never stay focused on any one person for long.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhile beauty is a depreciating asset, most other positive traits—wisdom, patience, commitment, good communication skills, etc.—are things that can improve over time. They make for a better investment, so to speak.  \n  \n  \n  \nSpeaking of investments, it’s possible that someone who really does look like a CoverGirl or Men's Health model may be less likely to invest time and energy in developing these other traits. It makes logical sense: if you can get by just fine on looks alone, why worry about kindness or patience or faithfulness? I know that’s not always the case, so don’t rule someone out based on appearances (either way). Just be careful, and don’t ignore red flags because he or she looks good on the outside.  \n  \n  \n  \nNow, I know some of you are about to get defensive, or maybe even claim that I have no credibility on this subject because my wife is hot. (And I definitely think she is.) But I never said that physical attraction doesn’t matter at all. It’s just less important than many people seem to think. When I have kids who are sick, or throwing a fit, or I’ve made some mistake, or we have a disagreement about our family budget—in times like that, which is a lot of the time—it’s not Monica’s physical beauty that I’m thankful for. It’s her wisdom, patience, forgiveness, grace, diligence, and other internal qualities that make our marriage work.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt is important that you are attracted to your spouse. But that attraction needs to be based on much more than just outward beauty. And since those other traits can’t be seen at first glance, it may mean you need to give someone a chance and get to know them better.  \n  \n  \n  \nTo help with that, next week we'll look at some tips for first dates.  \n  \n-JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)\n\n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"5MhaquRJxmW8Sg6828oQos"}}},"url":{"en-US":"how-important-is-physical-attraction"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-important-is-physical-attraction/"}}},

I've been reading in Genesis (through [Join the Journey](http://wmcc.jointhejourney.com/page/signup)) and it seems so easy: a man sends his friend to find him a wife. Awesome. Why did we stop doing that?!  \n  \n  \n  \nI'm only sort of kidding. Today we have intermingled biblical principles and cultural standards, and what we're left with is confusing. Consequently, I get asked a lot of [questions about dating](http://theporch.wpengine.com/google-hangout-02-06-13/) on a regular basis. As we start a new year, a new series at The Porch, and start approaching [Valentine’s Day](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-spend-valentines-day-if-you-are-single/), I thought I’d try to answer some of the more common dating questions.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Can a girl ask a guy out?**  \n  \nCan she? Yes. Should she? I wouldn't recommend it. Here's why:  \n  \n  \n  \nIt sets the tone in the relationship of the man being passive, a passenger in the relationship, while the woman takes control. The reason this question even comes up is because of masculine passivity, and guys not taking the initiative to ask out godly women. Instead of encouraging him to step up and be a man, it encourages yet more passivity.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis has always been a struggle in relationships, going all the way back to the Garden of Eden: Adam is the one God told not to eat the fruit from the tree, yet when Eve was tempted, he said nothing and went along with it. We also see many examples in Scripture where women get impatient with waiting on The Lord and push their own timing and desires. Abraham and Sarah were told that they would have a son together; instead of trusting God’s promise, Sarah took matters into her own hands and had her maidservant sleep with him. That decision affected generations to come. This desire to \"help\" God with his timetable by taking matters into your own hands is often a reflection of us not trusting that God is faithful to keep his promises, and that you may not trust a guy to step up and lead you.  \n  \n  \n  \nI've heard it said, ladies, that you are a treasure. [Treasures don't do the hunting](http://wordsfromwags.com/treasures-dont-do-the-hunting/). Men, step up, find a God-fearing lady and ask her out.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Should I pray with my boyfriend/girlfriend?**  \n  \nI've heard it said that you shouldn't, because it fosters intimacy prematurely. I don't see anywhere in Scripture that says you can't, but you should live out Proverbs 4:23.  \n  \n  \n  \nReally, praying together would be difficult to avoid if you are living out your faith. We pray before meals, to celebrate, when in need, and without ceasing ([according to Paul](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16-18&version=ESV)). So this is less a question of “should you?” and more a question of “how should you?” or “when should you?” If you’re praying alone together, and being more vulnerable through prayer or sharing things that you wouldn’t yet share through normal conversation, then that’s the problem.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Do I have to date in groups?**  \n  \nI don't see that law in the 10 Commandments. I do, however, see lots of examples in the Bible where the couple’s friends are in agreement and approve of the relationship. See, for example, Song of Solomon 1:4, where friends “rejoice and delight” and “praise (their) love more than wine.” You could also look at the many instances of arranged marriages, where friends or relatives decide who would make a good match.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn dating, you are intentionally observing someone and how they interact with others. You want to get to know what they are really like. That's difficult to do when your primary interactions with them are alone while they try to impress you. I'd avoid that (very common) scenario, and see how they behave towards people they aren’t trying to win over, or people they’ve already known for years. That will give you a better idea of how they will treat you years down the road.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How do I know if they are the one?**  \n  \nAre you well—that is, free from addictions and pursuing Christ? Are they likewise free from addictions and pursuing Christ? Are you both in biblical community and connected in a local church? Can you love them for the rest of your life, especially when you don't FEEL like it? If yes, yes, yes, and yes, they're the one.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Is it really that simple?**  \n  \nYes.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What now?**  \n  \nNext week, we’ll tackle the question of how important physical attraction is. Let us know what other dating questions you’d like to have answered.  \n  \n  \n  \nUntil then, join us at The Porch THIS Tuesday, January 27th for our new series Missing Out.

Because you’re single.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut some of you don’t have to be. More than once, I’ve encouraged Christian men who are ready for marriage to [find the most godly single woman](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-man-should-look-for-in-a-woman/) they know and [ask her out](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-girls-ask-guys-out/). According to some of those women, it still doesn’t happen as often as they’d like.  \n  \n  \n  \nMaybe it’s because you don’t know what to do. Perhaps you’ve never dated towards marriage before. Or maybe you have, but you’re still unsure because it’s never worked out (if it had, you wouldn’t currently be single).  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, perhaps I can help make it easier and give you ideas of what you could do on a first date.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What Makes for a Good First Date**  \n  \nThe goal of dating is (or should be) to determine whether or not the two of you should get married. If so, you get married. If not, you [break up](http://theporch.wpengine.com/9-signs-you-should-break-up/).  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s that simple. In fact, it’s so simple that throughout most of human history, people managed to figure it out without dating at all. Dating didn’t exist. True story.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s why dating isn’t really mentioned in the Bible. But, we can still apply biblical principles and wisdom and common sense to it.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs that relates to planning a first date, I’d say you are looking for something that is:\n\n  \n- **Public.** As in, around other people. It makes sense for safety reasons, and so that there is less temptation to do anything [inappropriate](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-far-is-too-far/) physically. The best-case scenario is that it would be around other people you both know, because then you can see how they interact with friends who they’re not necessarily trying to impress, as well as get feedback from your community afterwards. (John 3:20-21)\n  \n- **Low-pressure.** It’s just a first date. The goal is really just to get to know each other a little bit more. Don’t make it into too big a deal, or do anything that will make you more nervous than you already are. (Matthew 6:34)\n  \n- **A good place to talk.** Again, the main goal is to get to know each other better, so you want to be able to talk. That’s why something like a movie, which is one of the first things people think of for dates, isn’t really a good idea for _first_ dates. It’s two hours of not talking and not even looking at each other. (Proverbs 15:2)\n  \n- **Fairly short.** A first date can be good or bad (or somewhere in-between). If it’s not going well, you don’t want to be stuck together at an all-day event an hour from your apartment. If it’s going well, a short date’s still fine, because it gets you a second date. This isn’t really the time to share every minor detail of your life story, anyway. (Proverbs 4:23)\n  \n- **Clearly a date.** It’s awkward when only one person thinks it’s a date. Also, you don’t want to play with the other person’s emotions: is he interested in me in that way? Is this the “friend zone,” or something more? Guys can avoid this by paying for the date (girls, consider that a sign); by showing interest and quickly following up with a second date (if it goes well); or by literally using the word “date.” (Ephesians 4:25)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n**Dallas First Date Ideas**  \n  \nSo what kinds of dates would provide those things? Here are a few ideas:  \n\n  \n- **Coffee.** It’s simple. It’s extremely low-pressure, and it’s all conversation. Because it is so low-key, though, you may need to be clearer about your intentions (see the last point above.) [Watermark Coffee](http://www.yelp.com/biz/watermark-coffee-dallas), of course, is a great option, but only if you’re going during the week (it’s closed on the weekends, which includes Friday evenings). But really, most coffee shops (and especially the [local or non-chain ones](http://www.yelp.com/list/21-good-independent-dallas-coffee-shops-dallas)) provide a fairly cool environment, so it’s hard to go wrong.\n  \n- **Dinner.** Or a weekend lunch, if you prefer. This might fit in the “obvious” category, but there’s also the question of where: for a first date, I wouldn’t recommend something too fancy (too much pressure; save that for special occasions). But I also wouldn’t recommend McDonald’s. Go for something in-between: an interesting but casual spot. A few examples in the Watermark area:[Asian Mint](http://www.asianmint.com), [Café Amore](http://www.cafeamoredfw.com), [Torchy’s Tacos](http://torchystacos.com), or [Liberty Burger](http://givemelibertyburger.com). And about a thousand other places similar to those.\n  \n- **Museums.** Especially art museums. They’re interesting, and give you something to talk about. They’re also often free, which doesn’t hurt. You can check out the [DMA](https://www.dma.org), the [Nasher](http://www.nashersculpturecenter.org), and the [Crow Collection](http://crowcollection.org) all next to each other in Dallas, and right next to Klyde Warren Park. In Fort Worth you have the [Kimbell](https://www.kimbellart.org), the [Amon Carter](http://www.cartermuseum.org), and the [Modern](http://themodern.org) all in close proximity.\n  \n- **Sports.** Baseball, for instance, allows time to talk, and during the season there are plenty of games and relatively cheap tickets (especially in Frisco, with the minor-league [Roughriders](http://www.milb.com/index.jsp?sid=t540). If you’d rather take part in something resembling a sport, bowling is always an option, but preferably someplace cool (like [Bowlounge](http://www.bowlounge.com)).\n  \n  \n  \n  \nOf course, not everyone is interested in baseball, or art, or (insert date option here), so it helps to know a little bit about each other first. And this isn’t meant to be a full list; just a few ideas you can use.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor those who aren’t single anymore: what did you do for your first date?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)"},"url":{"en-US":"first-date-tips"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/first-date-tips/"}}},

Hopefully, people don’t just want my opinion on anything, but rather want to know what the Bible says on the issue. On the issue of online dating, or even dating in general, the Bible is void of examples. That’s because, like the internet, dating as we know it is a relatively new invention that didn’t exist throughout most of human history. The Scriptures do, however, have many wisdom principles that we can apply to these issues.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Dating Problems**  \n  \nMy concerns with dating in general are that people usually misrepresent themselves. We get dolled up and put on our best behavior to hopefully win an engagement proposal. Consider this: as our culture has gotten more experienced or “better” at dating, it seems we have gotten worse at marriage. We are marrying later, marrying less, and those marriages are failing more often. WE ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG (fact) and I believe it has to do with how we date.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo how should we date? It’s no secret that in biblical times, our example was arranged marriages. I’m not advocating arranged marriages, but I am strongly advocating the _principles_ of arranged marriages. You must hear me out here:\n\n  \n- Marriages were arranged by people who knew the bride and the groom and loved them.\n  \n- Marriages were arranged based on someone’s longstanding character, or said otherwise, their reputation.\n  \n- Marriages were arranged by families who had the couple’s best interests in mind.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nThe principles there are that you don’t make these decisions in isolation; that wise people who know you very well and care about you very much are in favor of it; and that decisions are based on who the person really is, as evidenced by how they act even before meeting you.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Dating Online**  \n  \nOK, so what about online dating? First of all, I’m sure you know someone who met online and has a “happy” marriage (so do I). So it can work out. However, there are some things about online dating that can make it less likely to work out.  \n  \n  \n  \nOnline dating adds another step to the “dog and pony” show of dating. Now, it starts with a profile and a profile pic. And to paraphrase Proverbs 31:30, profiles are deceiving and pictures are fleeting. No one puts their worst picture on their profile; they put their best, even if it’s a few years out-of-date. (And if the picture is the main thing you’re basing decisions on, remember that physical attraction [isn’t as important as you think](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-important-is-physical-attraction/).) Also, no one puts their strange idiosyncrasies or sin struggles in their profile; they present their most positive resume. Why? Because we all want to be loved, liked, swiped, chosen, asked out, etc. You’re not swiping a real person; you are swiping a veneer. They might end up being the biggest pain of your existence, and they might be really good at keeping that from you until they choose to let you know.  \n  \nSo if I’m right, what do you do? You have to be really good at getting to know the real person. That’s tricky because if they don’t want to show you who they really are, they might be excellent at keeping it from you. I have two simple rules that will help a lot if you choose to date online:  \n\n  \n1. Remember that profiles lie (see above).\n  \n2. Don’t go on a date with a stranger.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, number 2 makes online dating difficult, I know. I wouldn’t compromise on it, though. If they are a stranger to you, then hopefully they are not a stranger to someone you know and trust who can say “I’ve known so-and-so for many years and they have proven to be faithful and genuine and (list the qualities you are after here).” If we did this, I’d bet divorce rates would go down. We’d marry earlier. Marriages would last longer (like until death), and we’d have a greater satisfaction in them.  \n  \n  \n  \nShould you date online? I’m sad that you’d need to. I don’t say that at all to shame you; I’m simply bummed that guys aren’t asking “who are the good girls” and then asking them out and girls aren’t asking “who are the good guys” and praying they ask them out. (I know some of you do! Thank you for your examples.)  \n  \n  \n  \nI love my single friends, and if you desire marriage, I pray that you would find someone who loves Jesus even more than they love you, who might ask you to spend the rest of your life with them.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1mx37Q24viGimkICwyyMaC"}}},"url":{"en-US":"should-christians-use-online-dating"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/should-christians-use-online-dating/"}}},

Should you go? Is it for you?  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Porch is a gathering of people in their twenties and thirties that meets every Tuesday in [Dallas](http://theporch.wpengine.com/contact-us/) and [Fort Worth](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-porch-fort-worth/).  \n  \n  \n  \nWherever we gather, the focus is on Jesus and how we can together live out lives that actually mean something.

So perhaps we should say what it’s not: it’s not a place for perfect people. It’s not for those who are good enough to go, and it’s not a self-help seminar focused on making you good enough. It’s not an insiders club for those who know some secret handshake or have old hymns memorized. It’s also not a place where you pay some penance or check off a box once a week, and then go and forget about it the other six days.  \n  \n  \n  \nEach Tuesday we talk about real issues relevant to today’s young adults (because that’s who we are). And we build relationships with people who will care enough to be honest with us and encourage us and live life with us throughout the week.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe are…well, the people you see here, plus thousands of others just like them.

James. The PR juggernauts brilliantly and strategically timed the release of this movie on the weekend most synonymously known for love (although I would argue the greatest weekend of love is Easter, but that’s for another time and place). Droves of women will be paying copious amounts of money to watch Christian Grey—an older, powerful businessman—use Anastasia Steele (Ana)—a young, naïve college girl—to fulfill his sexual conquests.  \n  \nHere is my general synopsis of the plot: Christian meets Ana. He stalks her to find out where she works and shows up there. He asks her out. He asks her to have sex with him but only if she signs a non-disclosure agreement because his sexual preferences are horrific. He learns she is a virgin. So, instead they have “normal” sex. He tells her his first time is with one of his mother’s friends who dominated him and he was the submissive partner. He keeps badgering her to sign the agreement so they can have “erotic” sex. Finally she agrees (oh, good news she graduates sometime during this time from college). They do the dirty, she hates it, she leaves him. For those of you wondering where I got this info, Wikipedia.  \n  \nThis, ladies, is the plot of a movie that many women are normalizing, celebrating, and enjoying this weekend. I’m not naïve, some of you have probably read the book and are going to see the movie. So, what’s my point? My point is this: this movie is wicked, the actions in this movie are wicked, and it’s my role as a shepherd to remind you of Isaiah 5:20 “Woe to those who call evil good.” With the banner raised, “It’s all in good fun”, women—many of whom are confessed believers—are perpetuating the lie that sexual domination and conquest are acceptable subject matters for entertainment. Often when people learn of the ancient Greeks’ preferences for entertainment—watching men kill each other, watching lions rip men apart, selling women into the sex trade—they are appalled at our ancestors. How is this different? While titillated by six-pack abs and the excitement of the unknown, this movie asks the viewer to root for an older, domineering man to take the precious virginity of a young impressionable girl. She’s someone’s daughter, sister, future mother, future wife, friend, and more importantly than all—a daughter of the one true God. Although fictional, what does it say about our hearts when we desire for her dismantling?  \n  \nHaving the pleasure and the privilege of leading the Women of Watermark, I can tell you, this situation happens and it is incredibly damaging for all parties involved.  \n  \nYet, where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more (Rom 5.20). Anastasia would be welcomed at [Shelter](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/shelter/) (make no mistake about it, the content of the movie is grounds for sexual abuse). She would find comfort at [ReGeneration](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery/) when she stood to say, “Hello, my name is Anastasia and I am recovering from finding my worth and identity in men.” She would be greeted, loved, encouraged and accepted at [Women’s Bible Study](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/womens-bible-study--thursday-night/). Someday she could be on staff working with me—a recovering Co-Dependent who used unhealthy relationships with females to satisfy my longing for intimacy.  \n  \nChristian Grey could find healing at [MenD](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/mend/)—our recovery program for men affected by sexual abuse. He could find the healing he needed from his mother’s friend. He would find acceptance at [ReGeneration](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery/) when he stood to say, “Hello, my name is Christian and I’m recovering from abusing women to hide from the pain of having been abused as a child.” He would someday link arms with JP, Todd, and others who recognize there is no brokenness God can’t heal.  \n  \nAnd now, for you. If you are one of the many who have indulged in the book or the movie, or quite frankly, want to but the fear of people pleasing is greater than the desire. You will find love and acceptance at [Watermark](http://www.watermark.org/), too. This is not a letter of judgment. It’s a letter to do my part as the shepherd and proclaim a wolf is in the camp. But my role as a shepherd is also to love the sheep who have been harmed—whether by they wolf or by your own desire to run from the Good Shepherd. If you need help or have been wounded, please reach to our staff or your leaders. There is no salve for pain like the healing power of the blood of Christ.  \n  \nTake heart, Women of Watermark, God loves you just the way you are. But, he loves you too much to leave you there. Let’s press on toward the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus (Phil 3.14).  \n  \n-Nika Spaulding\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"50-shades-of-grey"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/50-shades-of-grey/"}}},

But if everybody hated porn, all the articles wouldn’t be warranted. The problem is that most of the people saying they hate porn, also love it. That’s me. At one point in my life I loved porn more than I loved anything. That’s crazy to write because I know how absolutely true it is. I loved porn more than my future wife, more than my friends, more than my family, more than anything I owned, and more than God. The truth is, there’s still a piece of me that loves porn, and I know it’s there.  \n  \n  \n  \nEvery now and then an old image pops into my head from a mental filing cabinet that I thought was destroyed in the fire of my salvation. The image is foggy like a distant memory, but explicit enough to bring me to a place where I wish there was more of her. This happens at the most inopportune times, and is frequent enough to be familiar. Guided by the Spirit, I have practices that I’ve put in place to help me move on to more productive behaviors and escape the moral, adulterous failure of giving into the desire of entertaining that mysterious, alluring woman whom I've never met but know as intimately as I know anyone.  \n  \n\n\n#### **Why I Love Porn**\n  \n**Porn is an escape.** It is a door that leads out of life’s routine. Porn is a way out of hard work, screaming kids, tedious chores, difficult conversations, and the diligent pursuit that is necessary to make a marriage work. I heard someone say “life is hard and then you die.” Porn, on the other hand, is an easy way out. When we need a way out from life’s difficulties, porn says “this is the way.”  \n  \n**Porn is accessible.** It’s easy to find, and sometimes it even finds us at our most vulnerable moments. Porn doesn’t require you to do the dishes, take out the trash, take the kids to school, or even cuddle. Porn says, “I’m here for you to do with me as you please. Use me for your enjoyment and I won’t ask anything of you.” Porn is not an experience; it is a catalogue of experiences that otherwise would not be available to the normal person. It always offers something crazier, more dangerous, more scandalous, and more disgusting for you to enjoy.  \n  \n**Porn feels good.** Sex feels good. Explicit, out-of-bounds, naughty sex feels better. Why? Because when you know you are doing something that you shouldn’t, adrenaline bleeds into your body. Your heart races, your pupils dilate, and your body responds with heightened senses. Your five senses open up wide, allowing you to experience more. So the pleasure that sex offers is heightened, too. It is all of the pleasure of an extramarital affair, because that’s what it is.  \n  \n**Porn is anonymous.** It is sex with a stranger, and feels as though there are no strings attached and no victims. No fear of pregnancy or STDs. It seems that porn allows one to escape the consequences of an extramarital affair. You don’t have to care for someone’s heart or feelings. You can strip away their flesh from their personhood for your enjoyment at seemingly no cost and no one has to know—not even the object of your orgasm.  \n\n#### **The Problem With Porn**\n  \nPorn is an escape, **but everything is still waiting on you**. And now the difficulties of life are paired with the guilt and shame from acting out with porn. You didn’t escape anything. You complicated life’s problems. You made them more difficult for yourself. Had you prayed, asked the Holy Spirit for help, doubled down on commitment, leaned on community, and worked through the challenges that faced you, they would have been easier without porn. Porn isn’t a way out; it’s like a revolving door that keeps putting you back in the room with your problems. Only, now they are bigger.  \n  \nPorn is accessible, **but it is expensive.** It costs you your humanity, your dignity, your confidence, your joy, your intimacy with Jesus, and oneness with your spouse (present or future, whether you know them yet or not). Every single time you look at porn, you pay this price. Porn has never made anyone kinder, more confident, more joyful, closer to Jesus, or more one with their spouse. You’ve taken a very intentional step away from all of those things and sooner or later they will be gone altogether. That’s really, really expensive. Porn is never worth what it costs. It is a slippery slope of addiction leading to a dark place.  \n  \nPorn feels good, **but so does heroin**. If a momentary feeling of pleasure is ultimate to you, porn makes sense. So do heroin, bank robberies, and illegal sex. However, a life of oneness, free from shame, is much better than five minutes of erotic pleasure. Porn is not as good as what God has for you. It makes you its slave, trading a life of intimacy for a few minutes of pleasure. After you have gone over the fence to take pleasure, it is very difficult to enjoy it by entering through the gate. Porn offers you pleasure outside of marriage, but then that pleasure inside your marriage becomes less available, every time. Porn takes away more pleasure than it offers. The porn addict cannot experience oneness with their spouse.  \n  \nPorn is anonymous, **until it’s not.** Porn is sex with a stranger AND sex with the single most familiar person to you at the same time. Porn is sex with yourself. It is an enslaving addiction and the only way to start to get free from it is to stand up, raise your hand and say “I’m addicted to pornography.” That is the first step. The irony is that the anonymous sex you explored won’t let you go until others know about it. There’s nothing anonymous about that, unless you plan to die in anonymity and addiction. Satan would love that.  \n  \nThe truth is I love porn, but I know how much porn hates me. Porn hates my children and wants to see our relationship die. Porn hates my marriage and desires to see it end. Porn hates my ministry and wants to make it ineffective or worse, use it to further the work of Satan. I love porn, but it hates me. Porn is a terrible lover who has taken infinitely more from me than she could give. I love porn, but I know it’s not worth the cost. Today I am free and I loathe it much, much more than I love it.  \n\n– JP"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"7uO7GLYpyg4024UgWgIo4q"}}},"url":{"en-US":"why-i-love-porn"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-i-love-porn/"}}},

When should I share big things from my past?**  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s kind of a broad question.

So, when considering that question, there are some other questions to answer:\n\n  \n- **Is it really in the past?** Is this something that happened to you, or that you did at some point in your life, that is very unlikely to happen again? Or is it a pattern or habit from your past that you haven’t really been able to break?

For help, check out [re:generation](http://www.regenerationrecovery.org) (a Bible-based recovery ministry) if you’re in Dallas or [one of these cities](http://www.regenerationrecovery.org/find-a-church/).\n  \n- **Are you still in bondage to your past?** Even if it’s not an ongoing or a recent thing, sometimes things from your past can still rule over the present. It could be continued guilt and shame about something you’ve done. It could be trust or control (or other) issues because of something that’s been done to you. Either way, the best thing you could do for yourself and your future spouse would be to get help: again, through re:generation, or through [other recovery ministries](http://theporch.wpengine.com/rehab-resources/) specific to things like past abuse, divorce, abortion, or loss of loved ones.\n  \n- **Are you emotionally dumping on them?** There’s a difference between talking about your past and trying to drag someone into it. Don’t look to the person you’re dating to be your therapist, your savior, or to “fix” you. Jesus is the only one qualified to be your Savior. The reason the ministries mentioned above can help is because they do focus on Christ.\n  \n- **Why do you want to tell them, or why do you not want to tell them?** This heart check can help you determine whether one of the above situations applies. Are you reluctant because you haven’t really moved past it? Do you want to share because you really need help?\n  \n  \nOK, so back to the original question. The really, really short answer would be: share everything your potential future spouse wants to know or needs to know before you get married. Don’t intentionally keep anything from them. In marriage, you become one (Mark 10:7-9), and helping them know who, exactly, they’re choosing to become one with seems the loving thing to do. We are called to live in the light (1 John 1:5-10) and be children of light (Ephesians 5:8-11), and that means we’re not hiding our sins in the dark.  \n  \n  \n  \nYes, JP, but _when_ “before you get married”? Well, it makes sense that you wouldn’t wait until the day before the wedding to tell your fiancé some really major thing about your past. It would also be a questionable topic on your [first date](http://theporch.wpengine.com/first-date-tips/)—certainly you’ll talk about yourself, but getting into emotionally intimate details right from the start doesn’t seem like a great way to guard your heart. But over time, when you get a sense that the relationship is headed toward marriage, you should share everything that person might want to know: past addictions, sexual partners, hurts, crimes, etc.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you’re in Dallas, [Merge](http://theporch.wpengine.com/merge-dallas-premarital-class/) can be helpful for this. It’s a class for people who are seriously dating (thinking about getting engaged) or are already engaged. Certainly, if you’re going to Merge, it’s a good sign that you’re serious enough to talk about it.  \n  \n  \n  \nDon’t share anything in two-hour, late night, emotional phone conversations. Don’t share over text (I’m grieved that instruction might be necessary). Don’t share alone, late at night in your apartment with no one else around. Share in person, in a semi-public place. If it is really heavy, you might consider including your community group.  \n  \n  \n  \n**A New Creation**  \n  \nAn important thing to remember in all this: if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). If you have trusted your life to Christ, then you are not the same person you once were. You may still have to deal with earthly consequences from some things in your past, but those things don’t define you.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s much easier to share something dark about your past when it truly is the past, and no longer holds sway over who you are. And when the person you’re dating (who should also be a believer; 2 Corinthians 6:14) inevitably tells you about big things from their past, you need to remember that they, too, are a new creation. Be gentle, and be willing to forgive them (Ephesians 4:32). It doesn’t mean you have to marry them, but you do need to be able to forgive them.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd if you’re looking to marry someone perfect, I’ll save you a lifetime of searching: they don’t exist. Marriage requires forgiveness, both for past and present mistakes.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)"},"url":{"en-US":"when-should-i-share-my-past"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/when-should-i-share-my-past/"}}},

The one topic every seriously dating couple needs to discuss eventually, and the one they’re most reluctant to talk about.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s the sex talk. As in, talking about your sexual history.  \n  \n  \n  \n[God designed sex for marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/), for [a number of very good reasons](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/). Of course, sadly statistics show that a sizable majority of people have had sex with at least one partner before marriage. (I’m not being judgmental; I’m in that category.) Odds are, in almost every couple walking down the aisle, at least one (and likely both) of them will have some kind of sexual past.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo how do you talk about that with your future spouse? What do you talk about?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Things to Keep in Mind**  \n  \nFirst, check out [our post from two weeks ago](http://theporch.wpengine.com/when-should-i-share-my-past/), which talks about when you should have this discussion. It includes some biblical principles that you should keep in mind, including:\n\n  \n- Everyone has sinned (Romans 3:23). You won’t be marrying a perfect person, and neither will your spouse.\n  \n- If anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). You, and your future spouse, don’t have to be defined by your past.\n  \n- In marriage, the two of you become one (Mark 10:7-9). That means your spouse’s past becomes your past, too. And you can both be affected by it.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nNow, to look at some of the different situations you might be in:  \n  \n  \n  \n**What if I’m a virgin and my boyfriend/girlfriend is not?**  \n  \nGood for you! It’s a gift to both yourself and your future spouse that you don’t have any baggage from that.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat being said, it doesn’t mean that you’re perfect and the other person is flawed. You’re not without sin; your sin just looks different.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd that means, contrary to what some people seem to think, God doesn’t owe you a virgin spouse. God doesn’t owe you anything. It’s kind of like driving under the speed limit; you are not owed something for just doing what you’re supposed to do. You’re still much better off, simply because you don’t get a speeding ticket.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf your significant other has repented from their past sexual sin and turned from their past ways, you should forgive them, just as God already has (Ephesians 4:32; Colossians 3:13). Again, that doesn’t mean you have to marry them, but you should forgive.  \n  \n  \n  \nFinally, realize that there still may be earthly consequences for their past sin. Memories. Hurt feelings. STDs. Children, or the pain from aborted children (which can affect both [women](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/someone-cares--abortion-restoration/) and [men](http://www.forgottenfathers.org)). Just be aware and find out what those consequences might be, so you go into marriage knowing what you are committing to.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What if my boyfriend/girlfriend is a virgin and I’m not?**  \n  \nFor starters, you need to be honest. You do need to let them know at some point. Be willing to answer whatever questions they have (though see below about how many details to share).  \n  \n  \n  \nHave you truly turned away from that past? If so, what are you doing now to ensure you don’t fall back into past patterns? Talk is cheap; prove that you’re serious.  \n  \n  \n  \nAlso, have you been tested for STDs? Statistics say that a fair percentage of people have STDs, and many don’t realize it. Some are treatable; some aren’t. Part of loving your future spouse well is letting them know what they are signing up for. I realize that this might be something very difficult to share with someone. I’ve talked to many people with STDs, and they are often terrified of the thought of telling someone. When the time is right, however, you will need to.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What about past pornography/masturbation?**  \n  \nIt fits in this topic. Jesus equates lust with adultery (Matthew 5:27-28), so thoughts do count as another type of sexual sin that you’ll need to talk about together in a similar way.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What about past abuse or rape?**  \n  \nRape and abuse are sad parts of living in our fallen world. Though difficult to share (and difficult to hear), you do need to talk about it before marriage if that’s part of your story. Pray for confidence to share honestly and wholly forgive any perpetrator. In Dallas, you can [find help](http://theporch.wpengine.com/rehab-resources/) at [Shelter](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/shelter/) (for women) or [MenD](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/mend/) (for men).  \n  \n  \n  \nListen with grace. Remember that the person who is sharing is a victim. They are innocent in the matter; the sin was committed against them, not by them. You should not hold that against them in any way.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What should I tell them? Or, what questions should I ask?**  \n  \nWhen talking about any kind of sexual past, I’d caution against getting into too much detail. You need to be honest, so don’t deny them information if they ask and they really want to know. But be very careful what you ask for. You can’t un-hear something. Before asking, think: is this going to help our future marriage? Or will it just make me more resentful or insecure? (1 Corinthians 10:23-24)  \n  \n  \n  \nWhile I was the much more promiscuous one before marriage, Monica didn’t want to hear any details about it and after 10 years of marriage, she’s never brought it up. I, however, did want to know the details from her, and today I’m not sure how it helped.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, this is just my opinion, but I’d stick to the basics when asking about their sexual past. Some things that might be helpful to know:  \n\n  \n- The extent of it, such as how many partners, and whether it was ongoing or just happened one time (or a few times).\n  \n- What were the circumstances, or why did you make that choice? For example, was it a long-term relationship? A series of hookups? Because you got drunk? Such info can help you understand who they were in the past, and possibly know how to help guard against returning to old habits.\n  \n- What’s changed now? How can I know you’ve changed?\n  \n  \n  \n  \nYou’re free to ask for more details beyond that, but you do so at your own risk.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’d love to hear if any married couples disagree: do you wish you’d talked more about your sexual past before marriage, or less?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"5CdRvvqFSoIyqeIWuuqqi2"}}},"url":{"en-US":"discussing-your-sexual-past"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/discussing-your-sexual-past/"}}},

But what _is_ Launch, and why should you care?  \n  \n  \n  \nI’m talking to the people who have never been, obviously, and we care about you for that very reason. Since more people want to go than can go each year, we would like for those who haven’t been to make it at least once. Those who have been, we love you too, but we hope you are now helping us put on this year’s event (it takes a lot of volunteers to make it happen).  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, if you are considering going to Launch for the first time, here is what you need to know:  \n  \n  \n  \n**It’s a party at the lake. On steroids.**   \nYou are not “sacrificing” anything to spend your Labor Day weekend with us. Don’t want to give up hanging out at the lake with friends? Launch allows you to hang out at the lake with friends. 1,000 of them. And not just the lake, but a pool, and sort of a mini water park, and volleyball courts, and basketball courts, and who really knows what else at this point (past years have included carnival rides, mechanical bulls, and throwing pies at certain young adults pastors). And that guy who usually brings his guitar to your Labor Day party? His name will be Phil Wickham, and he’s bringing along [his friend Shane and his other friend, also named Shane](http://theporch.wpengine.com/q-a-with-shane-shane/).  \n  \n  \n  \n**It’s The Porch. On steroids.**   \nWe’ll have several times of worship and teaching by Todd Wagner (our Senior Pastor at Watermark), Matt Chandler (of the Village Church), and our very own Jonathan Pokluda. But instead of hanging out for a while on Tuesday night and then going home, you’ll get to stay there all day and then stay the night and do it again the next two days.  \n  \n  \n  \nSome of you need to change your playmates and your playground, and this is a great opportunity to do exactly that. You can hang out, dance, play cards, act stupid, and remember it all the next day (and forever) with no regrets.  \n  \n  \n  \n**It could change your life.**  \nI say this only because it has for so many people. God’s just chosen to work there, each year, and I pray that continues to happen. We’ve baptized people in the pool, had folks launch from there into lives marked by _life_, and seen countless lifelong (well, so far) friendships develop. A fair number of those have led to marriages, and though that would be an absolutely terrible motivation for going—do not go for that reason—we’ll still celebrate it if it happens.  \n  \n  \n  \n**It's going to sell out.**  \nWhich is why we’ve encouraged you to [sign up for it right now](http://www.watermark.org/launch), because it will sell out, probably within a week (last year it was 3.5 days). Yes sign up now, stop reading this and [go sign up](http://www.watermark.org/launch/), we will be here when you get back… yes right now…  \n  \n  \n  \nOk now that you have signed up, what should you do? Well, pat yourself on the back, you made it in. What else? Make sure you let anyone else who you want to be there know that registration is open and that they need to move quickly to secure their spot.  \n  \n  \n  \nFinally, if you need some further incentive to join us, just check out some highlights from last year…  \n  \n  \n  \n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/104967446\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Michael Jackson at #Launch14](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch1.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch1.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Launch games](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch2.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch2.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Launch games](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch3.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch3.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Launch 80s party Back to the Future](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch4.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch4.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Sky Ranch Lake](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch5.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch5.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Launch from Blob](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch6.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch6.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Sky Ranch Canoeing](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch7.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch7.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Late Night Dance-off](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch8.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch8.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Johnny & Chachi](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch9.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch9.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Big Group Time](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch10.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch10.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Relay Race](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch11.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch11.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Hungry Hungry Hippos](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch12.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch12.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Worship](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch13.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch13.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n[![Launch 80s Costumes](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch14.jpg)](http://theporch.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Launch14.jpg)  \n  \n  \n  \n(Thanks to Lauren Dean, [Ron Acord](http://www.ronacord.com), [Tyler Park](http://tylerparkphotography.smugmug.com), and Paul Bailey for the photos and video!)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"what-is-the-launch-retreat"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-is-the-launch-retreat/"}}},

Streaming video is a big reason why we can have [The Porch Fort Worth](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-porch-fort-worth/) on Tuesdays and [Watermark Fort Worth](http://www.watermark.org/fortworth/) on Sundays. We have [The Porch App](http://get.theapp.co/a1a2), which helps people connect at The Porch and also allows for live streaming. Podcasting allows me to listen to great teachers during the week who may live a thousand miles away. We use emails to communicate [prayer requests](http://www.watermark.org/clickandpray/), and [hashtags to help spread the gospel](http://theporch.wpengine.com/mystory/). A lot of good can be done online.  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, if all you do is podcast sermons or watch streaming video at home alone, you’re missing out on almost everything God intends for you when it comes to church.  \n  \n  \n  \n**A Bad Habit**  \n  \nWhen the Bible talks about a church, it’s not talking about a building. That’s true. But it’s not talking about a podcast or a sermon message, either.  \n  \n  \n  \nA church is a gathering of people. It’s a group of believers who meet regularly to love each other (John 13:34-35), encourage each other (Hebrews 3:13), bear each other’s burdens (Galatians 6:2), confess sins to each other and pray for each other (James 5:16).  \n  \n  \n  \nThere are many such “[one anothers](http://storage.cloversites.com/wakarusamissionarychurch/documents/59one_another_scriptures.pdf)” in Scripture, and you can’t do a single one of them by yourself. They all require that you be in some form of biblical community.  \n  \n  \n  \nThen there’s Hebrews 10:25, which tells us to “not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.” It straight up says that 1) believers should not give up meeting together, and 2) some are in the habit of doing exactly that. As for “the Day,” that likely refers to Jesus’ second coming (1 Thessalonians 5:1-4), and we’re certainly much closer to that Day now than when it was written.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Missing Out**  \n  \nIf you just listen to podcasts and aren’t a member of a local church body, you also miss out on:\n\n  \n- Corporate worship through song. Although you can still sing by yourself, most people don’t, and it’s just not the same. (Ephesians 5:18-19; Colossians 3:16)\n  \n- Elder shepherding. The Bible talks about having church leaders who watch over and care for the members of each church (Hebrews 13:17, 1 Peter 5:1-5). Here’s the thing: in a few cases, this is exactly the reason why some people avoid being part of a church. But shepherding is for your benefit. Shepherds _care for_ sheep; it’s their job description. Sheep who don’t have a shepherd and aren’t part of a flock have less food, poorer health, and are much easier prey for wolves.\n  \n- Multi-generational involvement. You may have friends your age, but do you have people who know you and care about you who are older and wiser? If you’re single, are there married people showing and telling you how to marry well? Maybe you want kids someday, but don’t have any experience being around them? A church family gives you those interactions.\n  \n- Synergy in ministry. Here’s what I mean by that: if you want to do good, you can do a lot more good together with a group of like-minded people, who can pool resources and use their different talents to make a whole that’s greater than the sum of its parts. You can also care for each other, when needed. For example, at Watermark, no one who is a member and is consistently living in community with us will ever go hungry or homeless. (Acts 2:42-47)\n  \n  \n  \n  \nThere are different forms a church can take. Again, it’s not about a building; the churches mentioned in the New Testament seem to have mostly met in people’s houses (1 Corinthians 16:19; Colossians 4:15; Philemon 1:2). Just make sure that it’s fulfilling the biblical roles of a church, including the “one anothers” above and [the functions listed here](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-church-membership-is-important/).  \n  \n  \n  \nNone of this means you can’t also podcast sermons (I do), or stream the service occasionally when you are sick or out of town. Like I said, technology can be a great tool, as long as it’s not replacing community.

With her permission, I copied our existing volunteers on my email response (also posted below), and wanted to share the whole exchange with our blog readers as well.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Hey Garrett,_  \n  \n_Lately, I have been in great prayer, searching deeper in the word about my spiritual gifts and how I can be a servant leader in those. One question that is resonating within me is how can I serve my brothers and sisters in Christ well and serve others? Specifically, how can I serve The Porch/Porch Team well? How can I serve y'all in a way that you guys as a whole can be built up in Christ? I know that's a broad question, but I want to encompass any possibility of need that y'all might have currently that I can help, whether a specific prayer, encouragement, etc. I'm learning how can I make less of me and more of exalting Him. Thanks friend, and I'm praying for y'all!_  \n  \n _- XXXX_  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nHey XXXX! Thanks for the email…it is the kind of email that is a _gift_ to read and get to respond to!  \n  \n  \n  \nA couple of thoughts that I hope will encourage as you join our family:  \n  \n  \n  \n**Never change your question.**\n\n  \n- “The question” I’m referring to is the one you asked three times in your email:_“How can I serve?”_\n  \n- What a beautiful question—close your fist around it and never stop asking it. The moment the naturally self-centered drift that tempts us all has its way, the question of our hearts will invariably change to something else, something less Christ-exalting. Keep this question close to you and never let it leave.\n  \n- No matter what team you’re on or what role you play, “How can I serve?” sounds a lot better from all of us than “How am I being benefitted?” or “How can I be recognized?” does.\n  \n- _Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. – Philippians 2:4_\n  \n  \n**Never stop your search.**   \n\n  \n- “The search” I’m referring to is the one you talk about in your email; the search you’re already on. _“I’ve been in prayer”_ and _”searching deeper in the Word.”_ \n  \n- Prayer and Scripture are primary places you want to go to find answers about what your gifts may be; not to the self-help book section of a bookstore or to the philosophical musings of some TV personality. The One who gave you your gifts is the same one who inspired the text you’re looking to discover them in; that means you’re looking in the right place.\n  \n- Keep praying, keep talking to others who know you best, keep opening God’s Word, and of course, keep serving and paying attention to what gives you life as you do. While we all take out the proverbial “trash” of organizational life, we are also all in the process of discovering what we enjoy most as we serve others. I’m confident that over time the particular things that “unleash” your gifts the most will become increasingly obvious to you and those around you. May we each be faithful to identify them for each other, encourage each other, and set each other up to use the gifts we’ve been given.\n  \n- _Having gifts that differ according to the grace given us, let us use them. – Romans 12:6a_\n  \n  \n  \n  \n**Never grow weary.**  \n\n  \n- Remind yourself as you join the team that you are beginning a marathon, not a sprint. The target for us is simple, but not speedy: [Surrendered to God, we are changing the world through the lives of young adults.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/changing-our-mission/)Only God could do such a thing, and it is not wearisome to Him. Yet He has invited us into the work, and it can grow wearisome to us if we do not remain reliant on His Spirit to power us.\n  \n- It’s been well said before: “if dependence is your goal, weakness is your advantage.” Run like a person who is relying on Someone Else to help you finish the race, and finish you shall.\n  \n- _And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. – Galatians 6:9_\n  \n  \n  \n  \nGrateful for each person on this email and the ways you love one another and serve with diligence. **You are changing the world through the lives of young adults.** One at a time…our best days are ahead.  \n  \n  \n  \n- Garrett Raburn  \nWatermark Fort Worth Young Adult Coordinator  \n  \n[_Click here_](http://theporch.wpengine.com/connect/serve/) _if you would like more information about serving at The Porch in Fort Worth or Dallas._"},"url":{"en-US":"how-can-i-serve"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-can-i-serve/"}}},

I’ve heard many times that guys these days [just don’t grow up](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704409004576146321725889448), that [there aren’t enough “marriageable” men](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/09/24/decline_of_marriage_pew_shows_there_aren_t_enough_marriageable_men.html), or that [men aren’t really men anymore](http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/why-men-arent-really-men-anymore/). Listen, I know some young, godly men, who I am honored to do battle with. Sadly, though, they are outnumbered by another kind of “man\".  \n  \n  \n  \nWe have plenty of adult males. We have “bros” who haven’t quite learned to leave frat life behind. We have the lovable loser stereotype in sitcoms and movies. We have guys who are too passive ([ask her out already](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-girls-ask-guys-out/)), and guys who are too aggressive (way too many domestic abuse cases).  \n  \n  \n  \nThough they are all technically “men”—not women, not children—they don’t represent the ideal of manhood that people are looking for. In each case, you could still tell them to “be a man,” and it would make sense—even if you had a hard time defining exactly what that means.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Defining Manhood**  \n  \nThe Bible, which itself tells guys to “act like men” (1 Corinthians 16:13), has a lot to say on the subject. Not just on how to be a man, but how to be a good man. [A godly man](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-woman-should-look-for-in-a-man/). The kind of man the world needs.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you want to be a godly man, you should work on being:\n\n  \n- **Self-controlled.** Getting drunk, getting violent when angry, or being enslaved to any kind of addiction are not signs of self-control (Titus 1:7-8). But self-control is one of the surest signs of a mature man. Titus 2:6 tells younger men to be self-controlled, and 1 Timothy 3:2 lists it as a requirement for men who serve as elders.\n  \n- **Self-sacrificing.** Godly men don’t live selfishly. They put other’s needs above their own (Philippians 2:3-4), especially if that “other” person is their wife (Ephesians 5:25) or child. If worse comes to worse, a real man should be willing to literally sacrifice his life to protect those he loves (John 15:13).\n  \n- **Honorable towards women.** Men are called to treat “older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity” (1 Timothy 5:2). Married men are commanded to be gentle with their wives (Colossians 3:19) and to honor and be understanding of the way God has wired them (Ephesians 5:25). Objectifying women, sleeping around, and violence towards women is _not_ OK.\n  \n- **A hard worker.** Men are often thought of as being providers for their families (1 Timothy 5:8). If you’re single, that means providing for yourself and managing your finances so that you could someday provide for others (which may not be a wife or kids; the verse above includes relatives like elderly parents). That’s definitely not saying you have to make lots of money; manhood is not measured by income. And if you get laid off from a job, you don’t stop being a man. But you also don’t stop working; if you’re unemployed, you should work even harder at getting a job, and work at something that isn’t your “dream job” if that’s what you need to do. The common thread is to be diligent (Proverbs 13:4; Proverbs 14:23) and work hard (Colossians 3:23; 2 Thessalonians 3:10-12).\n  \n- **Principled.** One of the marks of moving from childhood to manhood is that you are driven by lasting principles, not temporary emotions. Men are called to stand firm (1 Corinthians 16:13) and not be deceived by false doctrine or the prevailing winds of the world (Ephesians 4:13-14). Men who are elders should be able teach these lasting truths to others (Titus 1:9).\n  \n- **Opposed to evil.** This might seem obvious, until you consider that there are people who call good evil and evil good (Isaiah 5:20), who suppress the truth (Romans 1:18) and approve of sin (Romans 1:32). A mature man should be able to distinguish between good and evil (Hebrews 5:13-14). He should love good (Titus 1:8) while exposing evil (Ephesians 5:11) and standing up against it (Ephesians 6:10-17).\n  \n- **Courageous.** It’s a necessary part of being self-sacrificial and standing up for what is right. It’s such a part of manhood that some versions of 1 Corinthians 16:13 translate “act like men” as “be courageous.” A courageous man initiates and takes action when needed (James 4:17). It doesn’t mean you don’t have fears; it just means you act despite those fears.\n  \n- **Loving.** Many people see love as being more of a feminine trait, rather than a manly one. But this is actually one of the clearest traits of manhood on the list. In the Bible, husbands are repeatedly asked to love their wives (Ephesians 5:25; Colossians 3:19). Wives don’t get that same command. The “act like men” instructions (1 Corinthians 16:13-14) close with “let all that you do be done in love.” 1 Corinthians 13, known as the “love chapter,” seems to associate love with manhood (1 Corinthians 13:11).\n  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen we’re talking about being loving, it’s important to note how it explains love:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. – 1 Corinthians 13:4-7_  \n  \nPatient. Kind. Not jealous. Not boastful, arrogant, or rude. Not irritable, or holding grudges. Unselfish. Unfailing. Bearing whatever burdens, always believing and hopeful. Not rejoicing in evil, but rejoicing in the truth.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s a description of a godly man, if I’ve ever heard one.  \n  \n  \n  \nGuys, be men. We desperately need more of you.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat do you think makes someone a man?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"3U2WrAx6HKg0OYKAgY0OKi"}}},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-be-a-man"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-be-a-man/"}}},

It’s remembered by billions of people globally through the holiday of Easter.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut the event itself was centered on just one person: Jesus of Nazareth, a 33-year-old carpenter’s son from a small town. A town famous, at the time, for never producing anyone famous. Yet this man became the most famous name in all of history. His life was so important that it reset the calendar; everyone else’s time is measured by how many years it is before or after His time. (B.C. = Before Christ; A.D. = Anno Domini, which is Latin for “Year of Our Lord.”)  \n  \n  \n  \nWho is this man? It’s a question asked even then, by those who heard Him speak (Mark 6:2) and even by those closest to Him (Matthew 8:27). And it’s a question He even asked His best friends about Himself: “Who do you say I am?” (Matthew 16:15)  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s a question that people have wrestled with ever since. Even today, it’s _the_ question. The most important question you can answer. No matter who you are or what you claim to believe, at some point you have to make a decision about what His life really means.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou have to deal with the stumbling block that is Jesus.  \n  \n  \n  \n**“Who do you say I am?”** Here’s what some people—both Christians and not—have had to say about Him:  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n_I know men and I tell you that Jesus Christ is no mere man.

No man can read the gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life._  \n– Albert Einstein, physicist, genius  \n  \n_Why did Christ come into the world? To liberate people from sickness, troubles, from death._   \n– Vladimir Putin, President and Prime Minister of Russia  \n  \n  \n  \n_Lived serenely as an artist greater than all artists — disdaining marble and clay and paint — working in living flesh. This extraordinary artist, hardly conceivable with the obtuse instrument of our nervous and stupefied modern brains, made neither statues nor paintings nor even books..... he states it loud and clear.. he made.. living men, immortals. That’s serious, you know, especially because it’s the truth._   \n– Vincent van Gogh, painter, considered one of the greatest artists in history  \n  \n  \n  \n_Oh, eternal and everlasting God…frame me more and more in the likeness of thy son, Jesus Christ, that living in thy fear, and dying in thy favor, I may in thy appointed time obtain the resurrection of the justified unto eternal life.

Five years ago my faith came to me.__I believed in the doctrine of Jesus Christ and my whole life underwent a sudden transformation. Life and death ceased to be evil. Instead of despair, I tasted joy and happiness that death could not take away._  \n– Leo Tolstoy, Russian author, considered one of the greatest novelists of all time  \n  \n  \n  \n_I am a historian, I am not a believer, but I must confess as a historian that this penniless preacher from Nazareth is irrevocably the very center of history. Jesus Christ is easily the most dominant figure in all history._   \n– H.G. Wells, English author, known as a father of science fiction  \n  \n  \n  \n_A man who was I believe there is no one deeper, lovelier, more sympathetic and more perfect than Jesus – not only is there no one else like him, there never could be anyone like him._   \n– Fyodor Dostoevsky, Russian novelist and philosopher  \n  \n  \n  \n_A man who was completely innocent, offered himself as a sacrifice for the good of others, including his enemies, and became the ransom of the world. It was a perfect act._  \n– Mahatma Gandhi, Hindu, described as the father of India  \n  \n  \n  \n_Jesus Christ is to me the outstanding personality of all time, all history, both as Son of God and as Son of Man. Everything he ever said or did has value for us today and that is something you can say of no other man, dead or alive. There is no easy middle ground to stroll upon. You either accept Jesus or reject him._   \n– Sholem Asch, Jewish author and dramatist  \n  \n  \n  \n_A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic – on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg – or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God; or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to._   \n– C.S. Lewis, English author, professor, and former atheist  \n  \n  \n  \nAll of them recognized that Jesus was not just another figure in history. He’s unique; in a different category than anyone else who has ever lived. But not all of them took seriously what that means for their lives. As C.S. Lewis puts it in the quote above, Jesus wasn’t just a great teacher, or a prophet, or a leader of a movement. Jesus claimed to be God, the Creator of the universe. He didn’t just teach truth; He said He _is_ the truth. He didn’t show people the way to heaven; He said He _is_ the way (John 14:6). That means He’s either an outrageous liar, a raving lunatic…or the Lord of all creation and the rightful Lord of your life.  \n  \n  \n  \nThose are your only options. And as you decide, remember that Jesus did more than just make claims. He told the weather what to do, and the weather obeyed Him. He healed incurable diseases, not with medicine but with a word or a touch. And not just illnesses; He cured dead people of death. And remember what Easter is about: that Jesus died on our behalf, to [take the punishment](http://theporch.wpengine.com/someone-has-to-pay/) for all we’ve done wrong—and then [raised _Himself_ from the dead](http://theporch.wpengine.com/resurrection/), to show that He has final power over death. And that this was witnessed by many people, all of whom later chose either death or imprisonment rather than simply denying that it was true.  \n  \n  \n  \n**_“But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”_**  \n  \n**_Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”_**  \n_- Matthew 16:15-16_  \n  \n  \n  \n**Who do you say Jesus is?**  \n  \n\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"who-do-you-say-that-i-am"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/who-do-you-say-that-i-am/"}}},

Or the second. Or the 19<sup>th</sup>. In fact, once you include state courts that have granted RFRA-type protections, the majority of the U.S. states operate under similar rules. The U.S. government itself passed a federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act back in 1993 by a combined vote of 533-3, if you count President Bill Clinton’s signature. And, of course, there’s that whole First Amendment thing back in 1791, which is why they’re called “restoration” acts, giving back rights that had long existed previously.  \n  \n  \n  \nClearly, religious freedom is something that almost nobody had any problem with—until right now.  \n  \n  \n  \nWe’ve seen similar outrage in similar recent cases. Just last year, the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision broke the internet when it was ruled that the government couldn’t force someone to pay for contraceptives that could cause abortions. Never mind that Hobby Lobby _did_ willingly pay for 16 out of the 20 contraceptives available, and that nothing prevented anyone from buying the other 4 themselves. People were _outraged_. They felt the government _should_ force the owners to violate their core beliefs, even though there was very little benefit to doing so. They already offer “Plan A” for free, so why force them to pay for Plan B?  \n  \n  \n  \nThe answer, sad to say, is that there’s a new fundamental “right” in the U.S. today. You won’t find it in the Declaration or Constitution, but it trumps every right listed there: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, due process, even the right to life. If you infringe on this new “right\", you’ll be vilified and even considered unfit for society.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat is it? It’s the right to have sex with anyone, at any time, without any consequences.  \n  \n  \n  \nJust think about it. In our hook-up culture, if you attempt to hinder society’s rights to free sex free of consequence, you will come under attack. For example, [private Christian universities](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/397677/persecution-gordon-college-david-french) risk [losing accreditation](http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Dispute+between+Christian+university+society+court+bound/10664286/story.html#__federated=1) over behavior guidelines that ask students to abstain from sex outside of traditional marriage. Though the quality of the education hasn’t changed one bit, lack of accreditation would make it harder for graduates to get jobs. In California last year, [a CEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) lost his job—at the company he’d co-founded, no less—because of his free-speech support of Proposition 8 back in 2008. (Proposition 8 passed in the general election, which means the majority of the state actually agreed with his position.)  \n  \n  \n  \nThen there’s abortion. Abortion is not only legal, but people get _really_ upset when common-sense regulations that make it safer for women also make it less convenient for some. (It’s apparently fine that a rural cancer patient may have to drive 3 hours for life-saving treatment. But a procedure that takes away a child’s life should be available on every corner, so you don’t have to think about it too much or consider it to be any big deal.)  \n  \n  \n  \nIn an interesting contrast to abortion, where the aim is to have sex without the natural consequence/blessing of having children, one consequence of same-sex relationships is that you _can’t_ have children. It’s never happened, not once in all of history. So today you have same-sex couples paying donors or surrogates so that they can “have” children together. As Italian designers Dolce and Gabbana, two prominent gay men, pointed out, this process intentionally deprives these kids for life of either a mother or a father. They were, of course, boycotted by an outraged “free sex” society.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd then there’s the current RFRA controversy. When you get past all the misinformation and hysteria, the debate comes down to this: should you be able to force an independent baker, photographer, or florist to celebrate a wedding that their religion (and most all religions) would prohibit? Even if you consider a three-tiered cake a “right,” there are literally dozens of competitors who are available to do the job. (I picked a random Indiana town on a random wedding website, and found 68 wedding cake vendors listed.) Don’t worry, no one will be left without cake, pictures, or flowers.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf we were talking about most any other issue, logic would prevail. If you want a BBQ pork sandwich, you don’t go into a halal restaurant (one that follows Islamic law) and demand that they serve you one. You also wouldn’t force a Jewish caterer to serve a gathering of neo-Nazis, even though such groups are legal and protected by the First Amendment. Both of those examples, by the way, would presumably be covered by any Religious Freedom Restoration Act, along with these [real-life cases](http://thefederalist.com/2015/03/30/meet-10-americans-helped-by-religious-freedom-bills-like-indianas/). The one difference is that none of those has anything to do with sexual expression.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo is this it? Is this the end game of the great American experiment? Over two centuries as the land of the free, and we decide the best thing we can give the world is free sex?  \n  \n  \n  \nThe truth is, [sex always has consequences](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/), and they can be good or bad depending on the situation. That’s true on both an individual and societal level, as we’re seeing now. We’ve cheapened sex to the point where it’s a commodity, available anywhere and at any time. It’s not special, or holy, or selfless, or loving anymore. Ironically, it’s not even “adult,” in the ways that are supposed to [mark someone as being an adult](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-be-a-man/): self-controlled. Committed. Responsible. Unselfish.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat can you do about it? Well, a great first step would be to choose what to do with yourself. Don’t be part of the problem.  \n  \n  \n  \nPray. (That’s still allowed, right? OK, good.)  \n  \n  \n  \nGet educated. Don’t trust 140 characters and a hashtag to give you accurate information. For a great, balanced explanation of the current RFRA law by a university law professor, [check out this article](http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/uva-law-prof-who-supports-gay-marriage-explains-why-he-supports-indianas-religious-freedom-law_902928.html?page=1).  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nFinally, decide for yourself who or what you’re going to follow. There will be consequences for going against the grain of this world. The question is whether you believe this world is all there is.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"sex-without-consequences"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/sex-without-consequences/"}}},

Leadership isn’t limited to politicians or CEOs; it includes moms, dads, teachers, coaches, chefs, singers, bus drivers, [Porch volunteers](http://theporch.wpengine.com/connect/serve/), [missionaries](http://theporch.wpengine.com/if-we-dont-go-who-will/), disciple-makers, heads of households, and…you get the idea. But not everyone is a good leader, and the world needs good leaders.  \n  \nTo become a good leader, there are some questions you need to ask yourself. You could think of them as the five Ws (and one H) of leadership.\n\n#### **Who am I leading?**\n  \nEveryone has the opportunity to lead, because every conversation you have is an opportunity for leadership. “Leadership” simply means to intentionally influence. Every human interaction is an opportunity to influence. So the people in your life that you regularly interact with are people that you could be leading.  \n\n#### **Where am I leading us?**\n  \nA lead strategist for a renowned consulting firm told me that forming a strategy is as simple as knowing where you are, knowing where you want to be, and then putting a plan together to get there. Before you take a step, or lead others to take a step, you need to know where you hope to end up. All directions start with the end in mind.  \n\n#### **What is my message?**\n  \nAfter you know where you are going, or what you want to influence people toward, you have to communicate that to others. People long to be inspired. We are thirsty for inspiration. So figure out how to inspire them towards the goal. Why should they go that direction? What will happen when they get there? Why is this mission important?  \n\n#### **When will I communicate my message?**\n  \nWhen? Always. Consistently. Vision leaks. People are forgetful. Tell them, and tell them again. You'll know that your messaging is consistent enough when they repeat it without you, or finish your sentences for you, perhaps even mocking you for how often you say it. But stay at it, and say it often.  \n\n#### **Why do they need a leader?**\n  \nBasically: because everyone does. Even the best leaders are led by others in some areas of their lives. The better question is, are you up for the job?  \n\n#### **How can I be a more effective follower?**\n  \nThe Bible talks a lot about submission. ([Colossians 3:17-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A17-24&version=ESV) is one example.) This has become a “bad word” among our generation, and is sometimes seen as an outdated idea. But it’s not. If leadership is still important, then being a follower is still important as well. Every leader is also a follower; even the President has to submit to Congress or the Supreme Court at times. And being a Christ-follower also literally means that you are following Christ.  \n  \nYou cannot be a good leader without first being a great follower. To become a great leader, follow and learn from great leaders.  \n  \nHow can you be a better follower and leader?  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)"},"url":{"en-US":"6-questions-for-leaders"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/6-questions-for-leaders/"}}},

It’s true that marriage rates are decreasing, and those who do get married are tying the knot later in life, on average. And so you have people saying [there just aren’t enough good marriage candidates](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/09/24/decline_of_marriage_pew_shows_there_aren_t_enough_marriageable_men.html), listing reasons [why marriage doesn’t work anymore](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/04/07/sex-columnist-5-reasons-marriage-doesnt-work-anymore/25398635/), or choosing to just live together instead. Conventional wisdom states that since half of all marriages end in divorce, and many of those who don’t divorce have unhappy marriages, then marriage just isn’t worth it.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut is that really true?  \n  \n  \n  \nIt turns out that the marriage picture isn’t nearly as bleak as we’ve been led to believe. Some people may be shying away from marriage, but they’re doing so based partly on false information.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo let’s set the record straight with some real facts about marriage that people don’t often talk about.  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Marriage usually works out.**  \n  \nWe’ve all heard the statistic that 50% of marriages end in divorce. I’ve quoted it myself. But, it turns out that [that number is probably wrong](http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2014/May/Divorce-Shocker-Most-Marriages-Do-Make-It/). Apparently, calculating the divorce rate isn’t as simple as you might think, partly because you can’t know the final numbers until everyone is either divorced or dead. New research [seems to agree](http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-myth-of-the-high-rate-of-divorce/00011473?all=1) that [the divorce rate has been declining](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/upshot/the-divorce-surge-is-over-but-the-myth-lives-on.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&bicmp=AD&bicmlukp=WT.mc_id&bicmst=1409232722000&bicmet=1419773522000&_r=4&abt=0002&abg=0), and if the trend continues “nearly two-thirds of marriages will never involve a divorce.” That still represents far too many divorces, but at least the odds are more in your favor. And that’s for the overall population; if you have a college degree, are active in church, and wait until after marriage to conceive and start a family, your chances of getting a divorce [fall considerably](http://www.stateofourunions.org/2012/social_indicators.php#divorce).  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd, of course, divorce is not a lottery. If both spouses are 100% committed to marriage for life, then the odds of divorce are 0%.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Most married people are happy.**  \n  \nYeah, but not getting a divorce doesn’t automatically mean you’ll have a happy marriage. What are your odds of being “happily married”?  \n  \n  \n  \n[Pretty high, actually](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2006/02/13/are-we-happy-yet/). About 43% of married people say they are “very happy,” compared to 24% of unmarried people. Most of the rest are “pretty happy”; only about 10% of married people said they were “not too happy.”  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s just for life as a whole; it doesn’t ask whether they are happy with their marriages. However, [another Pew Research study](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/11/18/iv-family/) did ask how people felt about their family life, and 84% of married people said they were “very satisfied.” Another 13% say they are “somewhat satisfied,” leaving only 3% to be “dissatisfied.”  \n  \n  \n  \nThe majority of single people also said they were “very satisfied,” but married people were the happiest in this area, by a fair margin. Divorced/separated individuals had the lowest satisfaction ratings.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. If you stick with it, your marriage will get better.**  \n  \nIf you do find yourself in an unhappy marriage, [divorce is not the answer](http://theporch.wpengine.com/divorce-and-reconciliation/) you’re looking for. In [a five-year study of unhappily married couples](http://americanvalues.org/search/item.php?id=13), it was found that those who divorced ended up no happier than those who stayed together. Even those who divorced and then married someone else were no happier than those who stayed married to their first spouse. Of the unhappy couples that did stay together, two-thirds of them reported being happy with their marriages five years later.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Living together before marriage is still a bad idea.**  \n  \nYears of [research](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=cohabitation+effect&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart&sa=X&ei=lS5DU4nuA6Pd2QWZ-ID4BA&ved=0CCcQgQMwAA) have shown that living together before marriage leads to a greater chance of divorce and other “poor marital outcomes.” But now, anytime you mention that [living together before marriage is a bad idea](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/), someone will argue that new research shows that’s not actually true.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe new research they’re referring to is [a study in the Journal of Marriage and Family](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12092/abstract). However, that study actually _also_ agrees that people who cohabitate before marriage are more likely to divorce. It simply tries to come up with an argument as to why that is. The argument goes like this:\n\n  \n- People who marry young are more likely to divorce.\n  \n- People who cohabitate before marriage are trying to “act married” (their words, not mine) from the moment they first move in together.\n  \n- If you pretend those people are married from the moment they move in together, rather than when they actually do get married, that would mean they were “married” at a younger age. And that younger age could explain why their divorce rate is higher.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nThe most glaring problem with this is that if you’re going to say everyone who lives together is already married, you have to also count any cohabitating couple that breaks up as having gotten a divorce. Which would actually make the divorce rate for cohabitating couples much, much higher. According to [government data](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_022.pdf), about 50% of cohabitating couples “divorce” within the first five years, and about 70% within 15 years.  \n  \n  \n  \nOther studies may also try to determine why cohabitation leads to a higher divorce rate and other poor marital outcomes. But remember, the only reason they’re able to look for _why_ it’s higher is because it is, indeed, higher. So, yes, living together before marriage is still a bad idea.  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. Marriage is still the best place to raise children.**  \n  \nWith fewer marriages, we have more children being raised by single parents or by cohabitating couples. Though it seems obvious that the best situation for a child is to be cared for by a loving mother and father who are committed to each other for life, some try to argue that “non-traditional” families are just as good at raising kids. But the numbers don’t back that up.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor example, [according to government data](http://www.americanvalues.org/catalog/pdfs/wmm3es.pdf):  \n\n  \n- Children living with a single parent are 3.1 times more likely to be physically abused, 4.8 times more likely to be sexually abused, and 3.6 times more likely to be emotionally abused than children living with their married biological parents.\n  \n- Those living with cohabitating biological parents—so everything the same as the married biological parents, except for the “married” part—fare no better: 4.3 times more physical abuse, 4.8 times more sexual abuse, and 3.1 times more emotional abuse.\n  \n- Worst off are children in cohabitating families where only one of the parents is their biological parent: they are 10.3 times more likely to be physically or emotionally abused, and 19.8 times more likely to be sexually abused. (If those same people are married, the abuse rate, though still rather high, is cut in half.)\n  \n  \n  \n  \nChildren raised by married biological parents [also have](http://www.americanvalues.org/catalog/pdfs/wmm3-30-conclusions.pdf) better physical and psychological health, lower infant mortality rates, and lower rates of substance abuse. They tend to do better in school, are more likely to graduate college, and are less likely to commit crime.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are a single parent, you have my utmost respect; I know it’s a difficult task. These stats are not meant to discourage you. But my hope is they might encourage everyone to make wise choices when it comes to dating and marriage.  \n  \n  \n  \n**6. There’s no such thing as “the one.”**  \n  \nThe idea of a soul mate—that there’s one and only one person on earth who’s right for you—isn’t biblical, scientific, or [logical](https://what-if.xkcd.com/9/). Fact is, there are a number of people who could make a good spouse for you, and you for them.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s worth mentioning because the idea of “the one” can cause problems. It can cause single people to be too picky, seeing any tiny flaw as evidence that somebody is not “the one” for them. Since nobody is perfect, if you think they _are_ perfect, that’s a red flag that you don’t really know them and have unrealistic expectations that will eventually leave you disappointed.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt can also cause married people to look elsewhere when marriage gets hard. Supposedly, if your spouse were “the one,” it wouldn’t be hard. So you may think you’ve married the wrong “one.” News flash: every marriage is hard at times. Which leads us to:  \n  \n  \n  \n**7. Marriage is hard, but good.**  \n  \nIt could get annoying, as a single person, to hear married friends say that marriage was “awesome, but hard,” or some variation on the phrase. Which was it? Surely if something was really hard work, it couldn’t be all that “awesome,” or vice versa.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs someone who is married, it makes perfect sense.  \n  \n  \n  \nMarriage is two imperfect, sinful people coming together to become one. But we’re still imperfect. We can still be selfish, or do dumb things, and end up hurting each other. Marriage requires a lot of work, a lot of communication, and a lot of forgiveness. It’s hard.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut it’s also worth it.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s worth it for all the reasons listed here. But it’s also worth it because even the hard parts are, in the end, good. They’re good in the same way that other hard things—like going to the gym, studying for a degree, or going through a [recovery program](http://www.regenerationrecovery.org)—are worthwhile. It’s a learning and refining process.  \n  \n  \n  \nUnlike the view some people have of love, marriage does require you to change. But it’s a change for the better.  \n  \n  \n  \n**8. Marriage is a picture of Christ’s love for you.**  \n  \nOr it should be, if you are living out your vows.  \n  \n  \n  \nMarriage is a commitment to actively love someone _no matter what_. No matter what may happen, and no matter what your spouse does or fails to do. “For better or worse,” with no limit placed on how much “worse” it can get. It’s a fully selfless, self-sacrificial love.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhich is why [the Bible compares it to Christ’s love for the church](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A22-32&version=ESV). Jesus humbly served His followers, even though He was King of the universe. He forgave people, even though they didn’t deserve forgiveness. He literally sacrificed Himself on the cross for us. [Nothing can separate us from His love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A38-39&version=ESV).  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s the kind of love and commitment we’re called to in marriage. And that’s how the hard parts of marriage change us: they make us more like Christ.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you’re single, none of this is meant to discourage you. There are some [ways in which singleness is better than marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-reasons-why-singleness-is-better-than-marriage-and-vice-versa/), as well. But if you’re dating someone and making decisions about marriage and the like, it’s good to have the facts.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"58Bu151q1iYyEuIKcqueAe"}}},"url":{"en-US":"truths-about-marraige"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/truths-about-marraige/"}}},

In fact, the reason I started with the guys is because I figured they might need more help. But nobody’s perfect; we’re all works in progress. Luckily [we don’t have to be perfect](http://theporch.wpengine.com/good-friday/), but we’re still called to holiness, and following your old way of life will not lead to the kind of life you really want (see Romans 6:21-22, or really [the whole chapter](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206&version=ESV)).  \n  \n  \n  \n**This, Not That**  \n  \nSo how do you become a godly woman? The Bible talks about several characteristics that women should strive to have—and other things they should avoid.\n\n  \n- **Be: A hard worker.** Proverbs 31:10-31 is the best-known section of scripture describing what it means to be a godly woman. Read it, and you’ll see that the biggest single theme is that she is a hard worker. Being a hard worker can look different ways in different situations or stages of life; I know some stay-at-home moms who work harder than I do at my full-time job. And having periods of rest is also important; it’s one of the 10 Commandments. Just don’t be lazy, and make good use of the time you have in this life.\n  \n- **Don’t be: A busybody.** Be busy, not a busybody. If you’re working hard at the right things, you won’t have time for gossip. (1 Timothy 5:13; 2 Thessalonians 3:11-12)\n  \n- **Be: Generous.** Again from Proverbs 31 (verse 20): “She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy.”\n  \n- **Don’t be: Materialistic.** This isn’t exclusive to women—it applies to men as well—but I have known women who struggle more with comparison and wanting to have what other women have. Pinterest isn’t always a good thing. (Matthew 6:19-21; 1 Timothy 6:10)\n  \n- **Be: Kind.** Proverbs 31:26: “She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.” See also Titus 2:5, where older women are encouraged to teach younger women to be kind.\n  \n- **Don’t be:**  **Mean.** Why do we have the whole “mean girls” stereotype? Because, for a few women, it’s true. Speak kindness, not slander (Titus 2:3; 1 Peter 2:1).\n  \n- **Be:**  **Wise.** The woman described in Proverbs 31 is intelligent and wise. She can make her own business decisions (Proverbs 31:16), speak wisdom, and teach others (Proverbs 31:26, above). Because of this, she’s trustworthy: “The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain” (Proverbs 31:11).\n  \n- **Don’t be: Foolish.** Proverbs 11:22: “Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout is a beautiful woman without discretion.” Discretion means using wisdom in deciding what you say or do. Someone without discretion says or does foolish things that can end up hurting others. They are not trustworthy. See also Proverbs 14:1.\n  \n- **Be: Modest.** “Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear—but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious” (1 Peter 3:3-4). Isn’t that what you really want: to be loved and appreciated for who you are, rather than just lusted over for what you could possibly do? Talking about modesty upsets some people; if that’s you, [read this](http://theporch.wpengine.com/modesty-turning-the-tables/).\n  \n- **Don’t be:**  **Vain.** The word “vain” can mean two different things: being “excessively proud of or concerned about one's own appearance,” or “without real significance, value, or importance; baseless or worthless; futile.” There’s a reason they’re related. Focusing on or finding your identity in your physical beauty is a losing proposition. There’s a reason why grandma’s not a supermodel, and there’s a reason why everyone loves her anyway. (Proverbs 31:30)\n  \n- **Be:**  **Gentle.** This is the imperishable beauty that 1 Peter 3:4 calls you to focus on instead of physical beauty. And it’s the flip side to...\n  \n- **Don’t be:**  **Quarrelsome.** There are a number of Proverbs that talk about quarrelsome or nagging wives, and they don’t paint a pretty picture.

About making it mean something that it hasn’t meant before.  \n  \n  \n  \nBy my observation, though, that’s already happened. Marriage has been redefined for some time now. And no, I’m actually not talking about [same-sex relationships](http://theporch.wpengine.com/truth-love-and-macklemore/).  \n  \n  \n  \nNot only have we reinvented marriage, but we’ve rejected the product we ended up with. Far fewer people in our generation are getting married, and many are opting for [cohabitation](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/) instead. It would be like if I told you that you should try eating with your fork held backwards. And this idea caught on and became cool and everyone started holding their forks by the tines and picking up food with the handle. Until people realized that eating with a backwards fork doesn’t really work; it’s not designed to pick up food that way, and some people ended up getting hurt by it. So, they rejected using forks altogether. This is what we’ve done with marriage: we’ve made it something it was never intended to be, and then rejected it as a bad idea.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Marriage Contract**  \n  \nSo what’s changed? We’ve taken something that was meant to be an unbreakable, holy covenant, and turned it into a consumer relationship.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat do I mean by that? Well, in a consumer relationship, it’s all about what you get out of it. You only give so you can get something in return. For example, if I go to Joe’s Burger Shop for lunch, I give money so that I can get a burger. I don’t give the money because Joe needs it; I give it because I want a burger. It’s a type of contract, which can be broken; if I don’t get a burger, I don’t pay (and vice versa). I can stop going to Joe’s at any time, if I get tired of it or if a better burger shop comes along or if they mess up one time and I get food poisoning.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou’ve probably heard of marriage referred to as a “marriage contract,” which puts it in this same category. If it’s a contract, it can be broken. If it’s a contract, it’s only worthwhile if I’m getting out of it at least as much as I’m putting in. It’s really all about me; the “us” is important just because it benefits me.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s what marriage is for most people today, whether they realize it or not. It’s why the divorce rate is as high as it is ([as we’ve discussed here](http://theporch.wpengine.com/truths-about-marraige/), it isn’t as high as most people think, but 30% or so is still far too high). And it helps explain why so many people are willing to expand the definition of marriage: if it’s just a contract, the same as my contract with the cable company, then any two ([or three](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/the-next-marriage-redefinition-massachusetts-lesbian-throuple-expecting-the), or however many) people can enter into it.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Real Deal**  \n  \nBut marriage hasn’t always been that way, and you don’t have to look very hard to find proof. It’s right there in the traditional wedding vows:  \n  \n_To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part._  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s pretty straightforward, really. Between this day and the day one of us dies, we’re committed to be together.  \n  \n  \n  \nNotice that it includes “for worse,” which is a limitless term—there’s no limit to how much “worse” something can get—as well as “for poorer,” “in sickness,” and “until death do us part.” That’s not a contract. That’s not saying, “love me and I’ll love you in return.” It’s saying “I’m committed to love you _no matter what_. Even if I don’t get anything in return. Even if you’re unfaithful, or you change, or you get sick and end up bedridden. _Nothing_ could cause me to give up on our marriage.”  \n  \n  \n  \nSome of you may be thinking: “JP, that doesn’t sound like a very good deal to sign up for. That’s kind of one-sided.” That’s actually the kind of response Jesus got in Matthew 19:10 when He was [talking about marriage and divorce](http://theporch.wpengine.com/jesus-crazy-talk-on-divorce/). And it would be one-sided—if you were the only one making that vow. But when both of you are vowing that to each other, and you live by the vows you make, it becomes a beautiful thing. Two people who are both selflessly looking out for each other, and focused on giving rather than taking from each other.  \n  \n  \n  \n**True Love**  \n  \nBut what about love? Somehow, commitment sounds a bit more like a chore and less like being madly in love with each other.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt turns out, the biblical view of marriage is actually far _more_ loving.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn a consumer relationship, your main focus is how the marriage benefits you. You may love your spouse, but in the end it’s really more about loving yourself.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe modern marriage also looks at love as a feeling, and feelings change; if you can fall in love, then you can also fall back out.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn contrast, a committed biblical marriage is focused on love as an action. That doesn’t mean you don’t still feel love just as strongly. But, again, feelings change, so if you’re committed to love your spouse always, it has to mean more than just a feeling. True love means serving that person and looking out for their best interests whether you really feel like it that day or not. And when something happens that might lead to a divorce among other couples, that’s when you can love them more than would ever be possible in a consumer marriage: by accepting their shortcomings, forgiving them, and choosing to love them anyways.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s why the Bible describes marriage as an earthly picture of God’s love for us (Ephesians 5:25-32). God doesn’t love us because we’re perfect and never disappoint Him or cheat on Him. On the contrary: even though we don’t deserve it, Christ sacrificed Himself on the cross on our behalf (Romans 5:8). Giving up yourself for someone when they don’t deserve it: that’s [true love](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-love/).  \n  \n  \n  \nSo let’s redefine marriage—the way it always was supposed to be. As a truly loving, unbreakable covenant established by God.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"re-redefining-marriage"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/re-redefining-marriage/"}}},

That you become a believer not by believing, but by obeying. And that the way to be made right with God is to never sin at all—or at least stay within some “good enough” threshold.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis idea causes problems, because:\n\n  \n- That’s not how it works at all. [The gospel](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-gospel/) (or “good news”; that’s what the word means) is that we don’t have to be “good enough.” In fact, nobody is “good enough” to go to heaven, because the standard is perfection, and only Jesus is perfect. However, [He died on our behalf](http://theporch.wpengine.com/losing-my-religion/); He took the punishment so we don’t have to. Being a Christian, then, isn’t about never sinning; it’s about understanding that you are a sinner and therefore need the sacrifice Jesus paid for that sin.\n  \n  \n\n  \n- It can cause non-believers to believe that they have no chance. If the requirement is perfection and you already realize you’re not perfect, then what can you do? So these people may give up hope, not realizing that full forgiveness is available to everyone. (See also [See also Paul](http://theporch.wpengine.com/paul-pastor-martyr-murderer-spy/), the self-described worst of sinners (1 Timothy 1:15), who became a Christian only after making a career out of _murdering Christians_.)\n  \n  \n**Not Bad at All**  \n  \nThere is another fast-growing problem in our culture regarding sin. Instead of people thinking that they aren’t good enough, some people believe that they’re already good enough, and therefore don’t need saving.  \n  \n  \n  \nYou see it a lot with the “born this way” argument. The logic goes like this: I was born with certain predispositions. Whether through genetics, or something else beyond my control, I was made to desire or do certain things. And since God designed me that way, and God doesn’t make mistakes, then there’s nothing wrong with acting in accordance with those desires or predispositions. It’s not a sin at all, as long as I really want to do it. Have you ever heard an argument similar to that?  \n  \n  \n  \nThat logic breaks down pretty quickly, though, whether you’re a Christian or not.  \n  \n  \n  \nFrom a purely secular standpoint, the problem is that you can be born with the predisposition to do a lot of different things. For example, there is a lot of evidence—[thousands of studies](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=genetic+predisposition+for+alcoholism&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44&as_vis=1), apparently—that say alcoholism is at least partially genetic. You could, therefore, say that many alcoholics are “born that way.” And that would mean there’s nothing wrong with those people giving in to their natural desires to be a practicing alcoholic.  \n  \n  \n  \nOr, take pedophilia. There are [many researchers today](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/14/local/la-me-pedophiles-20130115) who will say that an attraction to young children is something that many child molesters are born with. So does that make it OK? (As a parent, I’ll save you from guessing: the answer is NO.)  \n  \n  \n  \nFor me, I’d say I was born with the predisposition to want to sleep with every beautiful woman I see; to drink and pursue anything that would offer me a momentary good time; and to always selfishly seek my own interests at the expense of others. And for a while in my past, I regularly acted on those things.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe point is, we’re all born with predispositions towards things that are sins. The Bible doesn’t disagree; it specifically says we are born sinful (Psalm 51:5). It says that we are, by nature, children of wrath (Ephesians 2:3), meaning we do things that God has a right to be angry about. And it repeatedly says that all have sinned (Romans 5:12). You’d think that if people were “born perfect,” somebody would have managed to avoid sinning.  \n  \n  \n  \n**What We Really Need**  \n  \nThe real danger of the “born this way” argument is that it denies we need a Savior. If everything we naturally want to do is right and good just because we want to do it, then there must be no such thing as sin. In fact, in that case the only possible way to sin would be to do something we _don’t_ want to do. The only sin would be to go against our programming: to change or grow as a person.  \n  \n  \n  \nTo get to the good news, you have to go through the bad news. Yes, you are a sinner. Yes, you naturally want to do things that are wrong, or even naturally do wrong things that you don’t want to do (Romans 7:14-20). God didn’t make you into a sinner. Humanity became that way when we ran from God and the order that He offered. Your sins are your effort to be God and not trust His ways. But Jesus paid for those sins, too. And change and growth are possible (2 Corinthians 5:17). It’s not that change will save you; but if you’re saved, God can work to change the things that are holding you back from living life to the fullest (John 10:10).  \n  \n  \n  \nMy name is Jonathan Pokluda, and I was born a sinner. I still sin at times, and have a desire within me to sin in ways that would hurt my family, my friends, and myself. But I’ve been forgiven, I’ve been changed, and with the help of God’s Spirit, I no longer have to obey those desires. I’ve been re-born a different way. And it’s not my doing; it’s thanks to my Savior.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)"},"url":{"en-US":"born-this-way-indeed"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/born-this-way-indeed/"}}},

It’s a collection of short sayings or observations about how the world works, written mostly by [Solomon](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-science-of-solomon/), who was considered the wisest man in the world. But even though it was written nearly 3,000 years ago, every bit of it still holds true today—sometimes profoundly so.  \n  \n  \n  \nSince [The Porch](http://theporch.wpengine.com) is a ministry for people in their twenties and thirties, I thought it would be fun to come up with a top 10 list of proverbs that give good advice for young adults. But there were too many good ones, and I couldn’t narrow it down to just 10. So, here’s a top 12 list instead.  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. One pretends to be rich, yet has nothing; another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth. – Proverbs 13:7**  \n  \nHello, Dallas! Home of the [$30,000 millionaire](http://www.watermark.org/media/series/266/). This proverb is more than just an observation on how you shouldn’t judge a book from its cover, though. Especially for a young adult who is just getting established in life, trying to live beyond your means will lead you to have less means to live off of for the rest of your life. Live below your means, save money, and avoid debt, and you’ll end up with much more than the apparent high-roller. (See also Proverbs 22:7.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips. – Proverbs 27:2**  \n  \nJesus also talked about this, in [Luke 14:7-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+14%3A7-11&version=ESV), and said that “everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.” Basically, bragging about yourself is—well, bragging, and blatantly trying to make yourself look good does not make you look good at all. Just work to be worthy of praise, and eventually the praise will come on its own. (See also Proverbs 16:18.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly. – Proverbs 26:11**  \n  \nGreat word picture here, and oh so true. Everyone makes mistakes, but you’re supposed to learn from them. I’ve seen far too many young adults who just go on to make the same mistakes again, suffering the consequences each time, and developing bad habits or addictions in the process. Learn from your mistakes—or, better yet, learn from the mistakes of others. (See also Proverbs 26:12.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm. – Proverbs 13:20**  \n  \nGetting out of your destructive patterns often means [changing your playground and playmates](http://theporch.wpengine.com/changing-playground-and-playmates/). Some friends just aren’t good influences. I’ve heard it said that you are the average of the people you spend the most time with. So spend time with people who improve your average. (See also Proverbs 14:7.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire; he breaks out against all sound judgment. – Proverbs 18:1**  \n  \nYou may need to get rid of some bad influences, but replace them with good influences. Too many young adults [isolate themselves](http://theporch.wpengine.com/no-more-isolation-island/) so that they aren’t accountable to anyone. We’re more connected online, but [more lonely in real life](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-lonely-generation/). You need [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/connect/community/): people who care about you, who know everything that’s going on with you, and can speak wisdom into the decisions you face. To learn about Watermark’s community groups, [click here](http://www.watermark.org/connect/singles-community/). (See also Proverbs 18:24.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**6. Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you. – Proverbs 9:8**  \n  \nHaving someone correct you or give constructive criticism isn’t always fun. But, it is extremely valuable. One of the signs of a true friend is that they will lovingly tell you when you are wrong, or when they see areas in which you could improve. You’re a fool (or at least not wise) if you get angry at such rebukes; wise people will be thankful for them. (See also Proverbs 12:1.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**7. The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty. – Proverbs 21:5**  \n  \nThere are a lot of proverbs that talk about the value of working diligently, versus being lazy, trying to get rich quick, or making hasty decisions. Work hard at the work you have in front of you, whether it’s your dream job, [a job you hate](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-to-do-if-you-hate-your-job/), searching for a job ([if you’re unemployed](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/careers-in-motion/)), or attending school. (See also Proverbs 14:23.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**8. Whoever guards his mouth preserves his life; he who opens wide his lips comes to ruin. – Proverbs 13:3**  \n  \nThere are also a lot of proverbs on the topic of controlling your tongue. Some are more colorful; Proverbs 18:6 is “A fool’s lips walk into a fight, and his mouth invites a beating.” (That one hit a bit close to home, since I’ve lived that out a time or two in my distant past.) The overall point is that talking too much, or for the wrong reasons, will eventually cause problems for you. This applies even more so today with social media broadcasting your words to the world. (See also Proverbs 10:19.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**9. Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life. – Proverbs 4:23**  \n  \nThis is the “guard your heart” verse. It’s often used to caution people against falling in love too quickly. But it can also apply to anything you might set your heart on: money, fame, a pet sin, or any false idol. You are what you think about. (See also Proverbs 27:19.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**10. Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. – Proverbs 31:30**  \n  \n[Physical attraction isn’t as important as you think](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-important-is-physical-attraction/). That goes for both guys and girls. It fades, and it’s not what will make you happy in relationships. Instead of focusing on looks, girls should [strive to be godly women](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-be-a-godly-woman/), and single guys should find the most godly woman they know and [ask her out](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-girls-ask-guys-out/). (See also Proverbs 11:22.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**11. Many a man proclaims his own steadfast love, but a faithful man who can find? – Proverbs 20:6**  \n  \nAnd here’s another one that relates to dating, but from the opposite side. Girls, don’t just take his word for it. Let his actions speak for him, preferably over a long period of time (or talk to people he’s in community with who have known him well for a long time). Look at how he treats his friends and other people who he’s not trying to impress, and who he’s not hoping to get something back from. Men: [be faithful](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-power-of-being-faithful/), and work on [being a godly man](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-be-a-man/) rather than just trying to win her over. (See also Proverbs 3:3.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**12. Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. – Proverbs 3:5-6**  \n  \nIn a way, this sums them all up. Though Proverbs is about being wise, you’re still not going to be as wise as God. You’re [not really in control](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-is-in-control/), and you definitely can’t see the future like He can. So trust in Him, read His Word, and follow His advice. (See also Proverbs 14:12.)  \n  \n  \n  \nHere’s a good practice: there are 31 chapters in Proverbs, or one for every day of the month (most months, anyway). So every day, you can look at the date on the calendar and go read that chapter of Proverbs. You’ll find there are not just 12, but dozens and dozens of verses that are very applicable to your life.

Instead of giving in to what feels good right now, practice delayed gratification and [choose long-term benefits over short-term pleasure](http://theporch.wpengine.com/choosing-ramen/).  \n  \n_ **2. Diets determine cravings.** _ You are creating an appetite. Think about coffee: the first time you drink it, it doesn’t taste that great; but if you drink it regularly, you’ll develop an appetite for it or even an addiction to it. Coffee’s probably not the problem, though. Stuff like the pornography you’re watching—that’s a problem. You’ll develop an appetite for it, and sex within marriage won’t satisfy that addiction, because sex isn’t porn. Marriage sex also isn’t [premarital sex](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/), so don’t make sex outside of marriage part of your diet. I believe one of the biggest predictors of extramarital affairs is premarital sex. You've grown an appetite for sex outside of marriage, so of course you will crave that.  \n  \n_ **3. Habits form your character.** _ What you do now determines who you will be later. Develop habits that will turn you into who you want to be.  \n  \n_ **4. Failing to plan is planning to fail.** _ You are becoming something. If you’re not careful you’ll become the wrong something. Figure out what older version of yourself you want to be and consider what path might help you get there (Proverbs 21:5), understanding that the Lord determines the steps (Proverbs 16:9). So start with knowing Him better.  \n  \n_ **5. Read the Bible and memorize all you can.** _ I still know all of the words to Lil’ Troy’s “Wanna Be a Baller,” but I wish I’d memorized all the words to the book of James instead. Or even Leviticus, for that matter. The lyrics (and many other pointless things) are still with me, but I wish they were something else.  \n  \n_ **6. Memories are the hardest things to lose.** _ So be careful what you listen to and watch. I have a mental Rolodex of dozens of pornographic images in my mind that I am only slowly forgetting. I wish I could expedite that process.  \n  \n_ **7. Look for godly characteristics in a spouse.** _ [Pretty people get old](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-important-is-physical-attraction/), and popularity is a short-term investment. Godly characteristics produce an incredible life-long return.  \n  \n_ **8. Date towards marriage.** _ Don’t just date for fun, or slide into [living together](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/). You’re either called to singleness, or you should be actively pursuing a spouse (or preparing yourself for one).  \n  \n_ **9. Grow up.** _ You’re in your 20s, which means you’re well old enough to be an adult. So take responsibility. Get married. Work hard. [Be a man](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-be-a-man/). (I’m talking to my past self here; if you’re a woman instead, [be a godly woman](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-be-a-godly-woman/).) History is filled with people who did great things and started great movements before age 30. Start now and [be faithful to see it through](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-power-of-being-faithful/).  \n  \n_ **10. Getting drunk is stupid.** _ No one has ever said, “That was the best idea ever! Being drunk really helped me navigate that situation.”  \n  \n_ **11. Save money.** _ You'll need it later.  \n  \n_ **12. Be generous.** _ It will be the best money you spend.  \n  \n_ **13. Exercise.** _ Getting in shape only becomes harder as you get older.  \n  \n_ **14. Eat right.** _ Again, it only gets harder. Your metabolism really will slow down. #2 applies here also.  \n  \n_ **15. Rest.** _ Do you feel like you don't have any time? Add a spouse, a couple kids, and other responsibilities to the mix. Trust me: you have more time now than you ever will. Learn to stop and [rest](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-keys-to-a-good-nights-sleep/) and slow down.  \n  \n_ **16 Material things are often bad investments.** _ Buy experiences instead. 14 years from now, you’d rather have memories of that backpacking trip through Europe ([the one I never took](http://theporch.wpengine.com/6-biggest-regrets-of-my-20s/)) than an obsolete big-screen TV or a slightly nicer 14-year-old car.  \n  \n_ **17. Travel.** _ It’s easier when you’re younger. You can do more, and do it cheaper. A 20-year-old can crash on couches or stay in hostels without a second thought, whereas your older self might expect a four-star resort.  \n  \n_ **18. Learn to appreciate what is available to you.** _ See above. I used to love going to the beach in Galveston. But once I saw a beach in the Caribbean, the Galveston I loved was no longer appealing. Basically, enjoy what you have while you have it. Don’t think you have to achieve all your dreams immediately. What you enjoy for the first time now may soon be boring.  \n  \n_ **19. Disciple others.** _ Want to change the world? [That’s how you do it.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-change-the-world/) You don’t have to be old and wise and have all the answers; you just have to be one step ahead of who you’re discipling.  \n  \n_ **20. Get in community.** _ Biblical community, with people who really know you and care enough to tell the hard truth when necessary. It’s one of the most helpful things you’ll ever do.  \n  \n_ **21. Don’t get that haircut.** _ Just don’t. Trust me. There will be pictures, and this thing called “social media,” and a future job where you’ll be on stage and coworkers will be in charge of a giant projection screen behind you.  \n  \nWhat decisions would you have made differently?  \n  \n- JP  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated Articles:  \n[12 Proverbs for Young Adults  \n](http://theporch.wpengine.com/12-proverbs-for-young-adults/)[10 Way to Ruin Your Life in Your 20s  \n](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-ways-to-ruin-your-life-in-your-20s/)[10 Parenting Lessons I Learned from Young Adults](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-parenting-lessons-i-learned-from-young-adults/)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"21-words-for-my-21-year-old-self"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/21-words-for-my-21-year-old-self/"}}},

And, as you’d expect, the conversation typically turns at some point to the relationship between God and science. When I ask them to explain this relationship, one particular idea seems to come out pretty consistently. Here’s what it sounds like:\n\n  \n- “When science progresses far enough, we won’t need God anymore.”\n  \n- “I think religion is less useful now that technology has come so far.”\n  \n- “Scientific discoveries make faith less and less necessary.”\n  \n- “We once used ‘God’ to explain the unexplainable. Now, there’s no need for that.”\n  \n  \nEach of these comments is voicing the same viewpoint: _that religion was created by humans due to an information gap that science is now closing_. In other words, the reasoning goes something like this: Once upon a time long ago, humans had questions we couldn’t answer, so we retreated to our emotional sensations of wonder, awe, and amazement to answer them for us. But now (the thinking goes) the need for such things has passed. Wonder, awe, and amazement were just worthy fill-in actors until our real hero – Knowledge – could finally arrive on the scene and save us from our now-obsolete emotional projections (like God). Religion is seen as sensation; scientific fact is sensibility.  \n  \nThis is the attitude of our day, no question. It is applied in some small ways (like denying that God has to do with sunsets and calling them mere “color refractions”) and some big ways (like refusing to define sex in anything but purely anatomical terms and denying that it carries any kind of spiritual significance). But the philosophy behind all these things is the same: _Why should we let our jaws drop as we look at a world whose mysteries have been removed? Why should we be transfixed by our world when we have such a high understanding of it (and can manipulate it to our benefit)? We’ve got explanations and technology now; being impressed is outdated._ Thus, science is seen as the great bubble-burster of the faith community.  \n  \nDo you hear the lurking assumption behind all of these things? The assumption is that _as discoveries of our world increase, our natural sense of wonder at it should decrease. As facts accumulate, awe is disposed of. As understanding grows, amazement shrinks. As knowledge and technology go up, being entranced by beauty goes down._  \n  \nI disagree with all this on three grounds.  \n  \n**First, belief in God is not an emotional “projection”.** It is the only logical, sane, and right-minded response to real historical events (meaning the death, burial, and physical resurrection of Jesus; see [1 Cor 15:3-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+15%3A3-4&version=NIV)). Humans did not create God out of our need; God created humans out of his freedom ([Gen 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1%3A27&version=NIV); [Psalm 115:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+115%3A3&version=NIV)).  \n  \n**Secondly, the Bible describes science as a road sign that points** _ **toward God’s existence, not away from it.** _ Consider this Scripture: “[God’s] invisible attributes…have been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world _in the things that have been made”_ ([Rom 1:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+1%3A19-20&version=NIV); emphasis added)_._  \n  \nQuestion: What does it mean that “the things that have been made” reveal “God’s invisible attributes”? Answer: It means that every single naturally occurring object in the universe, from stars to shellfish, shouts that there is a supernatural Cause for its existence. Go “science” your brains out, and you’ll never discover one thing that contradicts God’s existence. Accurate science is not a path away from God’s presence; it is his trail of bread crumbs that will lead you to it.  \n  \nScience’s self-admitted goal is to unravel every mystery of the natural world until every part is understood. This is not combative toward Christianity. If [Romans 1:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+1%3A19-20&version=NIV) is true, it means that the closer science gets to exposing the universe’s fabric, the closer it gets to its Weaver. Study away, scientists. Our joy has only to rise.  \n  \n**Thirdly, scientific knowledge does not _decrease_ our sense of wonder at the world, but _increases_ it.** Ask a 75 year-old man who’s been faithfully and healthily married for 50 years if his bride garners more of his appreciation today compared to the first year of his marriage. After half a century with her, does he have more complete knowledge of her than ever before? You bet he does. But is she any less worthy of acknowledgement in his eyes because of it? Does his intimate awareness of her lessen his appreciation for her? Is she less praiseworthy to him? I doubt it.  \n  \nAdded knowledge is not amazement’s termination; it is its genesis. Don’t just study God’s Word, go study his world, too, and your sense of mystery will _grow_ as you learn, not fade. (Think I’m crazy? Go read the Bible where the wisest man in the world tells you to go study an ant and be made wise for it.)  \n  \n**To conclude,** neither science nor technology can undo or make life’s miracles boring, big or small. The fact that you understand photosynthesis and own a lawn mower doesn’t change the fact that a blade of grass has power to spark your sense of wonder. **Being able to look down on clouds from an airplane window doesn’t mean they are any less impressive than when viewed from below.**  \n  \nMy counsel to you is this. The next time you leave your house, ask God to convince you of the truth that you are not living in world where man’s knowledge is master, but one where God’s design is governor. Ask him to remind you that earth is not man’s construction site; it is God’s theater. Ask him to replace your information-age boredom with simple, Edenic joys. And pray that he will show you a world of which you’ve learned plenty, but appreciated little.  \n  \nWhat do you think? Does scientific understanding stir your affections for God, or limit them?  \n  \n- Garrett Raburn"},"url":{"en-US":"science-friend-or-foe-of-faith"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/science-friend-or-foe-of-faith/"}}},

For some, it will be someone close to you, who you remember every day. Or perhaps it’s the grandparent who fought in Vietnam or Korea, who you never got to meet and only know through old pictures or stories. Or a great-grandparent in WWII, or great-great-grandparent in WWI…  \n  \nWait, you mean you don’t know? You seriously have no idea who your great-great-grandparents are? You don’t know their names, where they lived, what they did, or when or how they died? But they’re family?! Without them, you wouldn’t even be here! As far as we know, they might have been truly great people (great-great, even). And, if you’re young enough to still have living grandparents, odds are at least some of your great-great-grandparents (assuming they didn’t die in a war) were still alive just 50 or 60 years ago. Just one generation before you were born. We’re not talking ancient history; your great-great grandmother might have driven a Mustang and been a Beatles fan. And you have no idea what her name is.  \n  \nWhat’s my point here?  \n  \nWe all want to be great. We want to do something with our lives that really makes a difference. We want to change the world, and the majority of my generation wants to get famous in the process. So we chase after fame, and money, and prestige, and power, and respect, and we try to make a name for ourselves. And then we die, and 50 or 60 years later…nobody remembers who we were. Our own descendants don’t remember our names.  \n  \nWell, you may object, that’s not true for everyone. A few people do become really successful and make lasting names for themselves, and I’ll just try harder to be one of those people. So, I’ll ask you this: who is Zachary Taylor? John Tyler? Chester Arthur? Franklin Pierce? Do you know?  \n  \nAnswer: They were all Presidents of the United States of America. As in, the most powerful, successful, high-name-recognition position you could possibly hope to attain in this country. And I’d bet most of you didn’t know who most of them were. So although a few people may make a mark and make it into the history books, in a few generations it’s still hard to find anyone who really cares about what they did.  \n  \nThis isn’t meant to discourage you, but rather to encourage you to refocus your efforts. If you really want to make a difference, you should focus on the eternal. Earthly fame is fleeting; any monument you could possibly build to your own name on this earth will eventually turn to dust. But anything you do to make Christ more famous, and to point people towards Him, will have an eternal impact. It will be remembered forever, and you’ll be around to appreciate it forever.  \n  \nSo as you consider what mark you will leave on this world, reach deep into eternity and make deposits that will be memorialized forever. It may cost you something in this life, but you’ll be investing in something that provides eternal returns.  \n  \nThis Memorial Day, I am grateful for those who have given their life so that I can live in freedom. And I am eternally grateful for The One who willingly gave His life so that I can live forever.  \n  \n- JP  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"how-will-you-be-remembered"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-will-you-be-remembered/"}}},

The average age at which people first get married [has increased by about 7 years](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/11/millennials-marriage-age_n_4944558.html) since the 1950s. Or if that sounds like too long ago to compare: [according to the U.S. Census](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_B12007&prodType=table), it increased by 2 years just between 2005 and 2013 (the most recent year they list numbers for). The average married woman was single until she was 27.4 years old, and the average married man didn’t tie the knot until he was 29.4.  \n  \nPeople still _want_ to get married, though: the percentage of high school seniors who say that marriage and family are “extremely important” has remained [completely flat over the last four decades](https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2015/05/image.png). So something’s amiss; something is delaying marriage or making it harder to obtain.\n\n#### **Why It Matters**\n  \nNot everyone will get married. And if you don’t, that doesn’t mean you’re faulty or that God loves you any less. You may even feel [called to singleness](http://www.gotquestions.org/single-Christian.html). But if you’re not called to singleness, it’s hard to make a biblical case for intentionally delaying marriage.  \n  \nMarrying later makes it harder to stay pure ([1 Corinthians 7:9](http://bib.ly/1Co7.9.ESV)), since marriage is God’s design for sex. It makes it more difficult to have and raise kids together ([Genesis 9:7](http://bib.ly/Ge9.7.ESV)). It means you get to spend less time enjoying marriage together ([Proverbs 5:18-19](http://bib.ly/Pr5.18-19.ESV)). And, for some people, it means they delay maturing and taking on responsibility ([1 Corinthians 13:11](http://bib.ly/1Co13.11.ESV)).  \n\n#### **Why People Wait to Get Married**\n  \nThere can be some good reasons why some people should wait to get married (or not get married at all). However, those reasons haven’t really changed over the years, so they aren’t the reason why people are getting married later today.  \n  \nSo what is causing people to wait? There are a number of possibilities:  \n\n  \n- **They’re just “not ready.”** This could be a good reason or a bad one. Certainly you should be mature enough first. But if it’s taking people today years longer to become mature, that’s not a good thing. Why aren’t you ready? And if you're not ready today, what are you doing to get ready? Will that just magically happen? One day you'll wake up and be ready for marriage? Doubt it. Work to [become the type of man](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-be-a-man/) or [woman](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-be-a-godly-woman/) who is ready.\n  \n- **They buy the “live together first” lie.** This is the most likely cause; the rise of cohabitation corresponds nicely with the decline in marriage. If you’re a Christian, living together outside of marriage shouldn’t even be an option; it’s rebellion against your Lord. But even if you’re not a Christian, [living together before marriage is a bad idea](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/). It sets you up for failure, not success (and [yes, that’s still true according to recent research](http://theporch.wpengine.com/truths-about-marraige/)). Living together isn’t a smart way to prepare for marriage; if you’re not ready for marriage, then you’re not ready to live together, either.\n  \n- **They’re not financially ready.** This one doesn’t make any sense to me. Getting married, and combining two households into one, _helps_ with finances. [Statistically](http://www.today.com/money/why-married-people-tend-be-wealthier-its-complicated-1C8364877), married people (who stay married) end up much wealthier than if they’d stayed single. As a guy, I understand wanting to be able to provide for your wife; but, in another odd stat, [married men make more than single men](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/04/02/dont-be-a-bachelor-why-married-men-work-harder-and-smarter-and-make-more-money/). (Something about taking responsibility, working smarter, and making wiser choices.) The only way in which not being financially ready makes sense to me is if you’re talking about not being able to pay for the kind of wedding you want—and people who focus on having a more expensive wedding are [more likely to divorce later on](http://theporch.wpengine.com/7-wedding-wisdom-stats-for-singles/). So just do a cheaper wedding, and focus on planning a great marriage instead.\n  \n- **They have unrealistic expectations.** In a city with millions of people, you can’t find _anyone_ who meets your standards? Then maybe your standards are too high. Unrealistic standards will cost you in two very expensive ways: 1) they will keep you single so that you miss out on years of marriage, and 2) they will cause you to marry for the wrong reasons and have your marriage fail for the same wrong reasons. Ask yourself this: “Who would God set me up with?” I'll give you a hint: the fact that she's “hot” is [not high on His priority list](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-important-is-physical-attraction/).\n  \n- **They’re married to pornography.** This one is hard to admit, but is sometimes true. [Pornography is a trap](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-overcome-a-pornography-addiction/) that ruins marriage in more ways than one. You may not think you’re choosing porn over marriage, but the time you give to it is definitely not time you’re spending getting ready for marriage or building a relationship that could lead to marriage. And it’s a big source of the unrealistic expectations we just talked about, because porn is _not real_.\n  \n- **They want to “play the field” first.** This is unwise and, like several items on the list, can be outright sin (depending on your definition of “play the field”). The motivation behind this is usually that you don’t want to miss out on anything by getting married young; you want to have fun before settling down. Here’s one problem with that: marriage _is_ fun. It’s hard work, too, but it’s fun, and it’s a lot more fulfilling (and less hurtful, with less consequences) than serial dating.\n  \n- **They just don’t get asked.** This is a consequence of all the reasons above. I know that a lot of single ladies are reading this and thinking: JP, I don’t want to wait to get married, but no one is asking me! Well, that’s why I’m writing this. Guys, step one to getting married: ask a good girl out.\n  \n  \nIf you’re waiting faithfully, or pursuing wisely, and you’re doing everything more or less right: don’t be discouraged. Stay faithful. None of this means that there’s anything wrong with marrying later or staying single, if it’s done for the right reasons. And God is in control. Which means there’s one more reason why some people wait to get married: because God has a plan for you. He’s up to something. I’ve had friends get married later in life than they might have originally planned, and seen it all suddenly make sense: _that’s_ who they were waiting on. _That’s_ why it didn’t work out sooner.

It can range from the big, broad questions (“What does God want me to do with my life?”) to more specific decisions (“[Should I look for a new job?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-to-do-if-you-hate-your-job/)”).  \n  \nI’m happy to try to help, but I don’t have any special ability, like a mythical crystal ball that would allow me to see what job you should take or the name of [the person you should date](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-should-i-date/). I’m not a soothsayer; I just try to be a truth-sayer. Because what I do have is God’s Word, which has truth you can apply to your life on any questions you might be facing.  \n  \nBut you have [God’s Word](https://www.bible.com), too. And did you know it tells you what God’s will is for you? And not in some cryptic or hard-to-understand way; it literally says “this is the will of God.”  \n  \nTake a look:\n\n__It is God's will __that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the pagans, who do not know God… – [1 Thessalonians 4:3-5](http://bib.ly/1Th4.3-5.ESV)_\n\n  \n\n__For it is God's will__ that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil. – [1 Peter 2:15-16a](http://bib.ly/1Pe2.15-16.ESV)_\n\n  \n\n_Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; **for this is the will of God** in Christ Jesus for you. – [1 Thessalonians 5:16-18](http://bib.ly/1Th5.16-18.ESV)_\n\n  \n\n_They do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather **for the will of God**. For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do—living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry. – [1 Peter 4:2-3](http://bib.ly/1Pe4.2-3.ESV)_\n\n  \nThose are pretty clear, really. Do good; don’t do evil. Avoid things like [sexual immorality](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/), lust, and drunkenness. Pray always; rejoice always; [be thankful](http://theporch.wpengine.com/thankful/) always.  \n  \nThey may not cover your specific question, but I’ve had people ask me for help with some specific questions about God’s will when they’re willfully ignoring the things He’s already been clear on. They want to hear God speak into some obscure, minor question, without listening to where He’s already spoken about bigger, clear-cut issues. If you aren’t going to listen to what God has already said, why do you think He should bother to say anything else to you?  \n  \nIf you _are_ listening to what God has said in His Word, then He will make you better able to discern what His will is in more specific situations. That’s also from the Bible:  \n\n_Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will. – [Romans 12:2](http://bib.ly/Ro12.2.ESV)_\n\n  \nAnd remember that God gives us freedom in most decisions. As one of the 1 Peter verses says above: “Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.” As long as you’re not using your freedom to sin (and therefore going against God’s stated will), you can generally do what you want.  \n\n__The Most Important Thing__\n  \nThere’s one overarching aspect of God’s will that I haven’t mentioned yet. This is truly God’s will for you, and in comparison, none of the other questions you may have really matter all that much.  \n  \nWhat is it? Jesus spells it out:  \n\n_For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. **And this is the will of him who sent me** , that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. **For my Father’s will**  **is** that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. – [John 6:38-40](http://bib.ly/Jn6.38-40.ESV)_\n\n  \nIt’s what God wants for you:  \n\n_This is good, and pleases **God our Savior, who wants** all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people. This has now been witnessed to at the proper time. – [1 Timothy 2:3-6](http://bib.ly/1Ti2.3-6.ESV)_\n\n  \nAnd since none of us fully follow God’s will for every second of our lives—everyone has sinned ([Romans 3:23](http://bib.ly/Ro3.23.ESV))—the only way we could be saved was through Christ taking our place and being sentenced to death on the cross. That was God’s will, and is why Jesus said:  \n\n_Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet ***not my will, but yours be done***. – [Luke 22:42](http://bib.ly/Lk22.42.ESV)_\n\n  \nLike Jesus, we do have our own will, and so we decide for ourselves whether to choose God’s plan and accept His free gift of salvation.  \n  \nWhat questions do you have about God’s will for you?  \n  \n– JP\n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n  \n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"22NGKkGZWYmq6yGKSSiMiO"}}},"url":{"en-US":"gods-will-for-you"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/gods-will-for-you/"}}},

It’s the general idea that, as much as possible, we don’t tell people what to do. Of course, we do have laws—quite a large number of them, actually—with consequences for breaking any of them. But the country’s still considered mostly free.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Christian Freedom**  \n  \nFreedom is also at the core of Christianity. But, many people see it the opposite way. The popular non-Christian view of Christianity is that it is a long list of rules that you have to follow. Follow _all_ the rules, and you’re “in.” In this view, God is seen as some kind of cosmic killjoy, intent on keeping you from doing anything fun.  \n  \n  \n  \nObviously, that’s not a very attractive message. It’s why a lot of people reject Christianity; they’d rather do what they want to do, when they want to do it. They want freedom from anyone telling them what to do.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut that’s _not_ the message of Christianity. And, ironically, rebelling and doing whatever you feel like in the moment does _not_ lead to freedom; it leads to bondage.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Not Following the Rules**  \n  \n_To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”_  \n  \n_They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?”_  \n  \n_Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”_   \n  \n_- John 8:31-36_  \n  \n  \n  \nExcept for Christianity, every other religion I know of is performance-based. There’s a set of rules, and if you follow the rules, then maybe God (or whatever you believe in) will be happy, and things will go well for you. Jesus was a Jew, and the Jewish religion had over 600 rules and regulations to follow. Break any of them even one time, and there was some kind of punishment required: a payment to be made, a sacrifice given.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt didn’t work that well, because nobody could keep all of the laws—especially whenever Jesus clarified that even thoughts count (Matthew 5:21-22; Matthew 5:27-28).  \n  \n  \n  \nJesus said that He didn’t come to get rid of the laws; He came to fulfill them (Matthew 5:17). What does that mean? Well, He fulfilled them in that He was the only person to never break one of the rules, meaning He didn’t need to offer any sacrifices for payment. But He then truly fulfilled the law by becoming the sacrifice; He died to serve as the payment for your sins and mine.  \n  \n  \n  \nBecause of this, we don’t have to be perfect. We’re not made right with God by following each and every rule 100% of the time. We’re saved by what Jesus did, not by what we do or don’t do. We’re set free.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Freedom from Consequences**  \n  \n_“I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything”—but not everything is constructive. – 1 Corinthians 10:23_  \n  \nFreedom doesn’t mean that we can do absolutely anything without consequence, though. Remember, there are consequences if you break the law in our “free” country. And there are still earthly consequences to going against God’s law, even though you may have eternal forgiveness.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor example, the Bible says that it’s fine to drink alcohol. (That might surprise a few people, but check out 1 Timothy 5:23, as well as John 2:1-11). However, it draws the line at getting drunk (Ephesians 5:18; Galatians 5:21). Now, the reason it says to avoid drunkenness is not because God doesn’t want us to experience life. Quite the opposite (John 10:10). The reason to avoid drunkenness is because _there is no life to be found there_. Whatever “fun” you might have won’t even be remembered the next morning, while the poor decisions you make while drunk might haunt you for a long time.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe thing about ignoring God’s plan and purpose is that it eventually causes you to _lose_ the freedom you so wanted. I have some friends who no longer have the freedom to drink _any_ alcohol. They wanted the freedom to get drunk, and after pursuing that every day, became alcoholics. They lost the freedom to say “no” to alcohol, and it was only through [re:generation](http://www.regenerationrecovery.org) (a Christ-centered 12-step program) that they were able to get that freedom back. But the addiction is strong, and they can’t chance having a glass of wine over dinner with friends.  \n  \n  \n  \nSimilar things can happen with [pornography](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-overcome-a-pornography-addiction/) and [sex outside of marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/), to name two that I’ve experienced myself. I wanted to be free to do what I wanted, but ended up in slavery to those things instead. It was only through Christ that I was able to find freedom.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Choose Freedom**  \n  \n_The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:_  \n  \n_“The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”_  \n  \n_Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, “Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.” – Luke 4:17-20_  \n  \nThat’s the very first sermon Jesus gave recorded in the book of Luke. It’s short and to the point. So short, in fact, that Jesus cut off His reading of Isaiah 61 mid-sentence. It’s worth noting that the next line, the one He stopped before reading, is:  \n  \n_“…and the day of vengeance of our God.\"_  \n  \nThere will still be a day of vengeance. It’s just not what Jesus came for last time around. He came so that we could be free from that vengeance; a freedom we could not earn on our own. He offers that freedom as a free gift. If you choose to ignore it, because you think freedom and life lies in the temporary vices of this world—then the pleasures and pains of this world are the best you’re ever going to get.  \n  \nSo choose wisely.

Something would happen, my words would get out of control, I’d explode, and relationships would end. In fact, to this day I’m still trying to reconcile with some of my former friends.  \n  \n  \n  \nMy anger problem began to change when I started following Christ. Jesus has some pretty strong opinions on the subject of anger. In the [Sermon on the Mount](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/message/3412), He said:  \n  \n  \n  \n_You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’ But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell._   \n  \n_– Matthew 5:21-22_  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s pretty extreme. Jesus equates anger with murder. Murder, both then and now, is punishable by death. Jesus is saying that my outbursts of anger are punishable by death. Of course, Jesus also took on that punishment for us, but that doesn’t mean we should take the sin of anger lightly.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Responding to Anger**  \n  \nAnger is an emotion, and it can be difficult to control what you feel. But you can control what you do in response to that feeling.  \n  \n  \n  \nThink of anger as a warning light, like the “check engine light” in your car. When it comes on, you have three options:\n\n  \n- You can ignore it. But, that means you’re ignoring a problem. That problem can only get worse, and eventually you’ll be stranded on the edge of the road.\n  \n- You can overreact to it. The check engine light is on? Well, better stop the car, push it in the ditch, and walk home. It’s done for.\n  \n- You can find out what the problem is and get it fixed.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nClearly the third option is the best one, makes the most sense, and will have the best outcome. But it’s also the most work. It will take time, and it will cost you.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe same is true when you feel angry: the best option is to deal with it and work through the root problem. Don’t ignore it for years and let it fester, and don’t overreact and explode. Put in the work to resolve the issue.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow do you resolve it? The Bible spells it out. [Check out this post](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-cant-we-all-just-get-along-4-steps-to-resolving-conflict/) to see the biblical model for resolving conflict.  \n  \n  \n  \nSome things to keep in mind when you’re dealing with anger:  \n\n  \n1. **Own your part.** If you are a part of the conflict, you have a part in the conflict. Anger often makes us blind to our part, whether big or small. It may be a case where 99% of the conflict is NOT your fault. That does happen. But own your part in the 1%. Own 100% of that 1%.\n  \n2. **Overlook what you can.** Proverbs 19:11 says that “it is to one’s glory to overlook an offense.” If the offense is small, forget about it. “But, JP, how do I know if it is small enough to overlook?” Basically: if you can overlook it. If you can’t forget about it, if you’re driving down the road and having angry conversations with the other person in your head, then you haven’t been able to overlook it. And if you can’t overlook it, you need to resolve it.\n  \n3. **The person who seeks to win in conflict always loses.** It’s not about winning; it’s about resolving. “Winning” might make you feel good for a few seconds, but then you realize that you’ve lost a friend, or that you’ve hurt your ability to witness to them. You didn’t respond according to the Spirit that you say you have. Resolving conflict is about forgiveness and peace, not proving that you’re right or that you’re better than the other person.\n  \n4. **Resolving conflict is costly. Not resolving it is more costly.** Hard conversations are not fun, but they’re also not optional. The other person might not respond well; there’s a chance you might get burned. But if you don’t try to resolve the conflict, you always get burned.\n  \n5. **Do not judge obedience by the outcome.** Judge obedience by obedience. Sometimes you do the right thing and it turns out badly, and it will only make sense in heaven. But if you’ve been obedient, you’ve done your part. The outcome is not your responsibility.\n  \n6. **Healthy relationships are marked by conflict.** How can you have a relationship and not have conflict with someone? Do you even talk to each other? Nobody’s perfect, and everyone is different, so some conflict is going to occur. If it doesn’t, it probably means you are ignoring the problems. On the flip side, I’m definitely not saying you should stay in a relationship where you fight all the time; both extremes show that you aren’t resolving conflict effectively.\n  \n7. **Only talk to people who are part of the problem or the solution.** Preferably, both at the same time. In other words, don’t gossip or complain about what someone’s done when you haven’t even given them the chance to make it right.\n  \n8. **Men: any boy can turn his anger to throwing fists.** I have a 2-year-old, and when he gets upset he starts pushing people. But it takes [a real man](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-be-a-man/) to bring his childish emotions under the control of the Spirit of God and respond in peace. (Single women, avoid childish “boys.”)\n  \n9. **Women: you grow up in a culture where it’s cool to be “sassy,” “feisty,” or have “attitude.”**  **But it’s not cool in God’s kingdom.** That doesn’t [show that you’re a child of God](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-be-a-godly-woman/). (Single men, avoid women who are entertained by conflict.)\n  \n10. **Conflict is an opportunity to show Who you belong to.** Conflict, and how you respond to it, is one of the greatest opportunities you have to display your faith. The way you handle anger shouldn’t look like the way the world handles it. And when the world sees someone acting differently, it wants to know why.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nMatthew 5:19 says, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.” When you’re a child of someone, you display their characteristics. I’m 6’7”, so my 2-year-old is already crazy tall for his age. It’s part of his DNA. Peacemakers are called children of God because they display one of God’s characteristics. God pursued reconciliation and peace with us when He had a right to be angry because of our sin.

Our staff has brought in leaders like Tommy Nelson, Chuck Swindoll, Gary Haugen, and others. I’ve listened intently as these men have shared their most valuable insights. What came out was consistent: it was Scripture. These men bled Bible when they shared wisdom.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’ve also been able to watch great leaders navigate difficult situations. A week ago Sunday was an opportunity that stood out to me above others. Todd Wagner, a man who has played an enormous role in my spiritual growth, was supposed to have that Sunday off. However, Todd changed his plans to spend just a few minutes on stage addressing the recent ruling by the Supreme Court on same sex marriages in America. This is what leaders do. They address the issues of the times with truth. Below is much of what he shared on what we, as Christ followers, should do now.  \n  \n  \n  \n**On where we should start:**  \n  \n_Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye._   \n  \n_– Matthew 7:3-5_  \n  \n  \n  \n“I want to draw a circle right here around me and I want to change everything in it; I want to be more in step with Your (God’s) will and way.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**On why we shouldn’t be surprised:**  \n  \n_Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint, but blessed is he who keeps the law._   \n  \n_– Proverbs 29:18_  \n  \n  \n  \n“When they have no vision for a God who is good, and loving, and true, the people will be unrestrained. And there is no limit to the ways that they will go to try and find life and satisfaction. Father, help me do a better case of talking about how good Your will and way is. That the commandments of the Lord are not burdensome, and happy is he who keeps the law.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**On how to engage with others:**  \n  \n_Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ._   \n  \n_– Galatians 6:1-2_  \n  \n  \n  \n“Remember that you yourself at times need to be admonished and corrected and encouraged, and so go to people in a way that you yourself want to be admonished, corrected, and encouraged.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**On how we fulfill the law of Christ:**  \n  \n_If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing._  \n  \n_Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things._  \n  \n_– 1 Corinthians 13:1-7_  \n  \n  \n  \n“In everything you are doing, you (should be) motivated by love to seek the welfare of the city that you are in—not self-righteousness; that’s not looking to yourself, lest you too be tempted—but because you really love people, and by the grace and kindness of God you have come to see that God’s way is good.  \n  \n  \n  \n“How do you respond? You don’t respond cynically, and you don’t respond by syncing up. You don’t throw rainbows all over your social media page… “Love does not rejoice in unrighteousness.” That’s why you should never put a rainbow on your car, or try and sync up with others who are running away from God. It’s not loving to rejoice in that.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**On standing firm:**  \n  \n_But you, dress yourself for work; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them. And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land. They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, declares the Lord, to deliver you._   \n  \n_– Jeremiah 1:17-19_  \n  \n  \n  \n“These are great days to be alive, because God has been very specific and very clear with what He wants us to do, and now is our chance to do it…  \n  \n  \n  \n“Speak. Speak boldly. And when you speak, don’t speak with the anger of man, for that does not accomplish the righteousness of God.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**On sharing the gospel:**  \n  \n_For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek._   \n  \n_– Romans 1:16_  \n  \n  \n  \n“You share with your friends about the goodness and kindness of God. You tell them that God loves sinners like you, and sinners like them.”  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen addressing an important issue in our country, he didn’t share his original thoughts or opinions. He shared God’s. As Wagner himself put it, “I haven’t said very much Todd; that’s a lot of God’s Word.” And much of the above verses (and a few others he shared) were shared from memory; they were written on his heart and ready to spill out for such a time as this.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Lord’s foolishness is wiser than our own wisdom (1 Corinthians 1:25). Wise, godly leaders lead with Scripture.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With quotes from Todd Wagner, and help from Kevin McConaghy.)  \n  \n  \n  \n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/7ul3mm-9060?wmode=transparent\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[How to Live in a Post-Christian America](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-live-in-a-post-christian-america/)  \n[3 Messages on SCOTUS Ruling & 1 of Them is for You](http://theporch.wpengine.com/3-messages-on-the-scotus-ruling/)  \n[6 Questions for Leaders](http://theporch.wpengine.com/6-questions-for-leaders/)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"gods-opinion-not-todds-opinion"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/gods-opinion-not-todds-opinion/"}}},

What’s one of the biggest parts of being an adult? Having a job and keeping it. Maybe even one you hate.  \n  \nA few years ago, a movie came out called _The Informant!_, starring Matt Damon. It is based on the true story of Mark Whitacre. Mark Whitacre worked for a company, ADM, where the largest price-fixing scandal in American history was going on. Whitacre was asked by the FBI to help them investigate the scandal. Follow me here: one day he works for ADM, and the next day he works _at_ ADM _for_ the FBI—undercover.  \n  \nOne day he is just doing the everyday mundane tasks of his job—looking at Excel spreadsheets, answering emails, whatever—and the next day he’s helping the FBI bust one of the largest scandals in the history of corporate America. Do you think he woke up more excited? Do you think his work felt boring anymore?  \n  \nWhat changed? Only his perspective. One day he was just on the job; the next day he was on a MISSION.  \n  \nYou are on a mission. [Acts 17:25-26](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:25-26&version=NIV) says that the places and time you live are ordained by God. [Ephesians 2:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians%202:10&version=NIV) says that there are some good things He wants to accomplish through your life. [Colossians 4:2-6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians%204:2-6&version=NIV) calls us to make the most of every opportunity, and [Titus 2:10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=titus%202:10&version=NIV) says that the reason we work is to make the teachings of Jesus attractive.  \n  \nWere you on mission you went to work today? Did you make the teachings of Jesus attractive by the way you worked, and did you share the love and teachings of Jesus with those you work with?\n\n#### **It’s Not “Love It or Leave It”**\n  \nDo you hate your job? Good. Then you won’t be tempted to give your life to it. Who said you were supposed to love it? Did your great-grandfather love his job? Mine was a farmer. He was a farmer because his dad was a farmer, and his dad’s dad was a farmer. At one point in history, most everyone worked as farmers, but it wasn’t because everyone loved it; it was because everyone needed to eat.  \n  \nOur pursuit of happiness in the modern workspace has actually caused more discontentment and depression. Everyone is looking for their “calling,” and few feel like they’ve found it. Let me tell you what your calling is: to work hard, with excellence, no matter what you’re doing, so that the teachings of your Savior are attractive.  \n  \nThat’s essentially the message of [Colossians 3:22-24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians%203:22-24&version=NIV), which is advice given to _slaves_. I’m pretty sure most slaves didn’t love their jobs.  \n\n#### **If You Hate Your Job**\n  \nSo what should you do if you hate your job? Consider four things:  \n\n  \n1. **Are you thankful for it?** You know what is worse than hating your job? Hating the fact that you don’t have a job. Being thankfulfor what you do have is a huge step towards happiness. And even if you are asking God for help in finding a new job, the Bible says in [Philippians 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+4%3A6&version=NIV) that you are supposed to have an attitude of thanksgiving when you’re asking Him.\n  \n2. **Are you good at it?** Is your job something that you can do well? If so, are you doing it well? If not, why not? What would have to change for you to be able to do it well? If you are simply not capable of doing it well, then you should start looking for something that you can do with excellence.\n  \n3. **Are you giving it all you can?** What would improvement look like? This is a great question for other people to answer for you. Ask them today, starting with your boss. “How can I be a better employee?” What’s an area that you can grow in today?\n  \n4. **Are you making an eternal impact?** If not, it is time to start. What’s that—you can’t? Why not? What would it look like for you to start loving others around you and attracting them to Jesus?\n  \n  \nI had the opportunity to talk with Mark Whitacre, the real-life subject of _The Informant!_ I asked him what it was like working on mission for the FBI. He said it was exciting, but not nearly as exciting as his “on mission” work today. He is a Christian now. He trusted Christ in prison (yeah, turns out he was involved in some illegal activity). He told me how he travels now for his job, and everywhere he goes he tries to tell people about Jesus.  \n  \nYou are on mission. Not working for the FBI, but for the Creator of the universe. Your vision for your job might be way too small. I would encourage you to consider why God has you there, and what He wants to do through you.  \n  \nIf you hate your job, get a new one—working on mission, in the same place, for the Controller of the cosmos.  \n  \nWhat’s your job, and how are you living on mission at it?  \n  \n– JP"},"url":{"en-US":"what-to-do-if-you-hate-your-job"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-to-do-if-you-hate-your-job/"}}},

Then my thoughts completely reversed as I recognized, I just based my answer on a tv show and past crazy experience instead of God's word. So finally I realized, \"I don't know, but I'd love to figure this out!\" So here we go!  \n  \nLet's start with...  \n  \n**What do you mean by sexy?**  \n  \n_Sexy_  \n: concerned predominantly or excessively with sex (Dictionary.com)  \n: sexually appealing, attractive, or exciting (merriam-webster.com)  \n  \n  \n  \nLooking at the definition of “sexy,” if a woman is radiating sex appeal in a way that causes others to stumble, God’s Word is very clear that this will not go well for her. We see a strong warning from Jesus in Matthew 18:6 to those that cause others to stumble. He says that “It would be better for them to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck.” That doesn’t sound good.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn doing some research, one thing that can be very attractive to a man is a woman who is confident. So instead of desiring attention from a man based on sex appeal, as a Christian woman, how about leading out with godly confidence? When a woman is confident because her identity and trust are in the Lord (Jeremiah 17:7), instead of trying to radiate her sexuality, she will start radiating strength and dignity (Proverbs 31:25). Most godly men would say that is a very appealing quality in a woman.  \n  \n  \n  \nGodly confidence: YES!  \nRadiating sexuality: No.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How do you portray sexy?**  \n  \nWomen who are trying to portray sexy typically end up dressing [_scandalously_](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scandalous). God’s word also has something to say about dressing scandalously (offensively/immorally) and in a way that would classify you as a [temptress](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/temptress). Matthew 5:27-28 makes it clear that lust is a form of adultery. If you are dressing intentionally in a way to have men lust after you, you are encouraging men to be adulterers against the Lord and their spouse (or future spouse). I would go as far as to say that if you are trying to be a temptress in the way you dress, you are toeing the line of being an adulteress. The Lord reminds us in 1 Corinthians 8:9 and Romans 14:13 to not be a stumbling block to anyone’s faith. 1 Corinthians 6:13 reminds us that “the body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord.” A little later in verses 19-20 Paul writes, “…do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.” How you dress your body—God’s temple—matters.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo instead of dressing in a tempting way, why not dress [_classy_](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/classy) and in a way that honors the Lord? We can look at 1 Timothy 2:9-10 and see that the Lord calls women to “adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control…with what is proper for women who profess godliness.” A godly man will definitely find a woman dressing classy (stylish yet respectable, aka [modestly](http://theporch.wpengine.com/modesty-turning-the-tables/)) attractive. Take note that this does not mean you have to look homely, ladies! Proverbs 31:22 mentions that the virtuous woman’s clothing was of fine linen and purple. This implies that she was dressed well!  \n  \n  \n  \nClassy: YES!  \nScandalous: No.  \n  \n**When is it ok to act out sexy?**  \n  \nWithin our sex-crazed world, it is important to come back to truth about when sex and sexiness are considered a good thing. Easy answer here: for your husband and your husband only.  \n  \n  \n  \nBeing sexy around your husband is a good thing! We can look at 1 Corinthians 7:1-6 and see that sex in the context of marriage is encouraged, and going for an unhealthy period of time without sex is not good. So to the married ladies (especially those who grew up hearing that sex is a bad thing) remember that it is OK to be sexy for your husband. In fact, it is a good thing! If you haven’t been reminded lately, just read back through Song of Solomon, and maybe even read through it with your husband.  \n  \n  \n  \nTo all the single ladies (I know you cringe hearing Beyoncé’s song in your head reading those words), and to married women concerning any man who is not your husband, the Lord has a ton to say about sexual immorality. 1 Corinthians 6:18 tells us to [flee from it](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-far-is-too-far/)! That definitely doesn’t mean create temptation, tiptoe around it, or flirt with it. It means to run from and move quickly in the opposite direction. 1 Thessalonians 4:3 tells us that the will of God is that we would abstain from sexual immorality. Hebrews 13:4 reminds us that the marriage bed should be undefiled. This means you should strive to remain pure for your husband (whether current or future), and not play around as a temptress or adulteress now.  \n  \n  \n  \nFinally, Ephesians 5:5 goes as far as to say that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure has no inheritance in the kingdom of God. The Lord has made it incredibly clear and apparent that he cares deeply about us honoring him with our bodies and [not giving into the ways of this world](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+12%3A1-2&version=ESV), especially around sexuality.  \n  \n  \n  \nSexy for your husband: YES!  \nSexy for any other man: No.  \n  \nIf your story includes being a temptress, an adulteress, or having sex outside of marriage, we also want you to know that there is forgiveness and an opportunity to be a new creation in Christ Jesus! It’s never too late to throw off that old self:  \n  \n\n\n  \n- _But God shows his own love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. – Romans 5:8_\n  \n- _If we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. – 1 John 1:9_\n  \n- _Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. – 1 Corinthians 5:17_\n  \n  \nBe CONFIDENT. Be CLASSY. Be CHRIST-LIKE.  \n  \n-Ally Wall  \n  \n(With help from Sylvia McCallum)  \n  \nRelated Articles:  \n[Should a Single Christian Woman Desire to Feel Sexy?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-single-christian-women-desire-to-feel-sexy/)  \n[Modesty: Turning the Tables](http://theporch.wpengine.com/modesty-turning-the-tables/)  \n[How to Be a Godly Woman](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-be-a-godly-woman/)"},"url":{"en-US":"should-we-bring-sexy-back"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/should-we-bring-sexy-back/"}}},

I am not taking issue with those rituals themselves, but I am calling into question the motive: to be “sexy.”  \n  \n  \n  \nLet’s be honest, ladies, attention from men is important to you. Right? And what is a sure-fire, fast track way to get attention from men? Dressing sexy. (It “works,” in case you didn’t know.) But here’s my question: would your life be better without that type of attention?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Plain Jane vs. Sexy Susie**  \n  \nConsider two hypothetical situations. Imagine one girl, we’ll call her Plain Jane, who wears a smock-like, baggy muumuu everywhere she goes, and guys never pay any attention to her. Then, one day a guy is intrigued by her strange fashion and actually desires to get to know the heart of the girl underneath.  \n  \n  \n  \nCompare that with her identical twin, Sexy Susie. She’s curvy, tan, and fit, and we know all this because her clothes are tight and leave little to the imagination. She gets lots of attention from guys—mostly shallow guys, but there are a whole lot of shallow guys out there. She gets asked out a lot, but it seems like these “relationships” almost never go anywhere, or at least not anywhere good. She becomes addicted to attention, and as affirmation from the world becomes more and more important to her, her faith and relationship with God and His people become less and less important.  \n  \n  \n  \nIs that crazy? Over the years I’ve seen it happen over and over. I am not saying you need to buy a long, baggy muumuu (please don’t). I am saying that you need to renew your mind so that you think different from the world and think consistent with God’s will. Why do you want to feel sexy? Why do you want to be seen as sexy? These are good questions to wrestle with, journal on, and really think about.  \n  \n  \n  \nDo you think about these things like God does?  \n  \n  \n  \nLet me elaborate on that question with an example. I think if you read 1 Timothy 2:9-10 and 1 Peter 3:3-4, you would come away thinking, “Wow, we really don’t apply those verses today.” Was that some kind of weird cultural thing back then? Does that still apply today? And if you land on the fact that it still applies today, you are going to reconsider that [bikini](http://youtu.be/YDUlDXBgLH0) this summer. “But does God really not want me to wear a bikini? Everyone wears bikinis; I’ll be the weird girl.” You will indeed. No one wants to be the weird one-piece girl. It’s about as cool as being the no-bikini-blogger. I feel your pain.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Confidence in Christ**  \n  \nIt is normal to want to feel sexy to others. It is a natural way of thinking, consistent with the world. A supernatural way of thinking, however, is to desire the confidence of the Lord. To know that God has a desire for what your confidence is in, how you dress, and why.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you seek to honor Him in how you display your body, you might find yourself as the only one without a date. Is it worth it to honor God and be dateless? I think you will find out that it is. As you seek to honor Him, you might also find yourself as the only one with a date who shares your desire to honor the Lord. You might find someone who is attracted to _you_, not just your physical body at this moment.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you attract a guy with your sexiness, you will lose him when you're not sexy, and I promise that seasons of unsexiness lie ahead.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo if your confidence is in your curves, you are setting yourself up to be pretty insecure. If your confidence, however, is in Christ, then you are secure for eternity.  \n  \n  \n  \nLadies, I will keep challenging the men to step up and pursue Godly women. I will continue to call them out of childish behaviors and carnal attractions. Please help me, by not selling out. You don’t need to take the shortcuts that the world takes. Be sexy for your husband. When you’re married, you can spend the rest of your life inventing ways to be sexy for him. Until then, try not to think about it. Take thoughts captive and be careful what you feed your heart.  \n  \n  \n  \n“Easy for you to say, JP; you’re not a woman.” Indeed, I am not. So I asked some women I work with what they thought.

Making money off the body parts of aborted children is illegal, as is changing how you do a medical procedure in order to get intact body parts. Planned Parenthood has defended its actions by saying that it does not make a profit off the sale of children’s body parts; that the money only covers costs like the shipping and handling of the children’s organs.  \n  \n  \n  \nAs people argue back and forth about whether or not this trade in children’s body parts is illegal, I feel like there’s one giant elephant in the room that’s largely being ignored. Something that makes the whole question about the legality of selling children’s body parts a moot point. And that’s this: we’re talking about children’s body parts!  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Science of Abortion**  \n  \nSee, the only logical reason why abortion is allowed at all is because the aborted children are not considered individual people. Because if they _were_ people, then intentionally killing them would be considered murder, on the same level as killing a child in preschool. But, no, they’re just a clump of cells, right?  \n  \n  \n  \nSorry, but if you can get an intact and functioning heart, liver, thymus, kidneys, intestines, arms, legs, brain, etc. from an aborted child, then it’s quite a bit more than a clump of cells. In fact, just one of those organs alone would qualify as more than a nondescript clump of cells. Each part has a specific structure, function, and purpose. And you can’t get body parts without a body. A specific human body, with its own unique DNA, its own separate blood supply and blood type, and its own dreams. Yes,[dreams](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090413185734.htm).  \n  \n  \n  \nNone of this comes as a surprise. It’s long been known in science and medicine that, from conception, you have a separate, living human being, which develops all its own organs and parts very quickly. Some[fun facts](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002398.htm): weeks of pregnancy are measured from the first day of the mother’s last period, which is a full two weeks before conception can occur. So, measuring from conception, children start to develop organs in the third week—the same time that you would notice being late for your period. By week four or five after conception, a child has its own beating heart, pumping its own blood. It has arms, legs, eyes, and ears.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe only difference now is that we have video actually showing what these body parts look like at early stages. We can’t pretend that we just don’t know, or avoid thinking about it because it’s hidden from view. Abortion ends an innocent human life. And it’s done so roughly 58 million times in this country since 1973—almost 10 times as many people as were killed in the Jewish Holocaust, or roughly the equivalent of 400 Hiroshima nuclear bombs.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd we’re OK with this, why?  \n  \n  \n  \nAs these videos displaying the trafficking of human parts have come out, much of America was unbelievably apathetic to the news. We started allowing the killing of children in the womb a long time ago, and we’ve grown comfortable with the idea. And if you’re going to profit from taking a life in the womb, it simply makes sense to profit from selling the parts as well. You can hide the profit in “shipping and handling” if you want, but my guess is soon you won’t have to.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Stand for Life**  \n  \nTo be fair, many people are not OK with it. Polls have consistently shown that the country is split, about 50/50, between being pro-life and pro-choice. Interestingly, though,[one of those same polls](http://www.gallup.com/poll/162548/americans-misjudge-abortion-views.aspx) found that most people _think_ that the majority of their fellow Americans are in favor of abortion, even though pro-lifers had the slight majority at the time. I don’t know what that says about how the issue is portrayed in the media and the public sphere, but just know: if you are pro-life, you’re not in the minority, and you don’t have to be afraid of what other people think. You’re not an “extremist,” as[Planned Parenthood has tried to claim](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/30/politics/white-house-planned-parenthood-response/). Killing over 300,000 children a year, as Planned Parenthood does—I’d say that’s the real extreme. Stand up for what is right.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you wonder whether you would have spoken out against evils like slavery or the Holocaust, this is your chance to find out. Now is the time to speak out and[to vote](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-you-should-vote/).  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you have been part of an abortion, I’m not saying you’re evil or a murderer.

And when a million children a year are being killed, the solution isn’t to merely defund Planned Parenthood; the solution is to end abortion itself.  \n  \n  \n  \nObviously, some people will argue against that. I’ve heard all of the objections and the arguments for why elective abortions should be allowed. The problem is that none of those arguments work logically. At least, they don’t work unless we, as a nation, are willing to say it’s OK to kill children—for any reason, and really regardless of whether they are inside or outside the womb.  \n  \n  \n  \nSome of the objections you might throw out:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Each woman gets to choose what she does with her own body.**   \n  \nThere are at least two problems with this. First, and most importantly, we’re not talking about her body; we’re talking about the body of her child. [As we’ve seen](http://theporch.wpengine.com/planned-personhood/), that’s very clearly a different body, with its own DNA, blood type, and functioning organs.  \n  \nThe other problem is that both women and men have always had restrictions on what they can legally do with their bodies. You can’t legally use your body to do drugs, drive while drunk, engage in prostitution, attack someone, commit robbery, set fire to someone’s house, run a red light, sell tobacco to minors, abuse animals—the list goes on and on. So although it might sound persuasive, it’s not a true statement.  \n  \n**2. If someone is against abortion, they’re against women’s rights.**   \n  \nActually, if you're _for_ abortion you’re against women's rights. What women? Well, since over 50% of aborted children are girls, tens of millions of women have lost their most basic right to live. Regardless, killing an innocent person is not a “right”; it's a crime.  \n  \n**3. An abortion doesn’t kill a baby; it’s just a fetus.**  \n  \nTechnically, you started out as a zygote. Then you became a blastocyst; an embryo; a fetus; a newborn; an infant; a toddler; a preschooler; a preadolescent; an adolescent; and then an adult. These are all just names for different time periods in a human’s life. The word “fetus” doesn’t make someone less human, any more than the terms “teenager” or “elderly” makes those people less human.  \n  \nPlus, I didn’t say “baby”; I’ve only used the term “child” or “children” in these articles ([go back and look](http://theporch.wpengine.com/planned-personhood/)), and [the definition of “child”](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/child) specifically does include the unborn. So abortion does kill children.  \n  \n**4. Life begins at birth.**   \n  \nThat’s simply not true, scientifically. [Life begins at conception](http://www.justfactsdaily.com/the-science-of-abortion-when-does-life-begin/). Besides, if that were true, it would be totally OK to perform an abortion at full term, just a few seconds before birth. Except for location, there is no fundamental difference between a child who has just been born and a child who is inside the womb. Which is why [some medical experts argue that “after-birth abortions” should be allowed](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9113394/Killing-babies-no-different-from-abortion-experts-say.html). Logically, their argument makes perfect sense. So unless you think we should allow people to kill newborns, you shouldn’t be in favor of killing the not-yet-born.  \n  \n**5. People who are pro-life don’t really care about children, because they’re not willing to care for them after they’re born.**   \n  \nActually, we are. It’s been stated before publicly and published online, but I’ll repeat it here: if anyone has an unwanted child, he or she can bring him or her to [Watermark Community Church](http://www.watermark.org), 7540 LBJ Fwy, Dallas, TX 75251. We will find and provide a loving family home. No child is unwanted.  \n  \n**6. Pro-life people are trying to remove women’s access to health care.**   \n  \nThat doesn’t even make sense. Why would that be anyone’s goal? I have a wife and two daughters. I want women’s health care to be the best it can be. And, again, I work with a church that runs [a free health care clinic](http://questcareclinic.org) open to anyone. But since abortion always results in the death of a child, I’m not sure I’d consider that “health care.”  \n  \n**7. If abortion is made illegal, people will get back-alley abortions.**  \n  \nA few will. Illegally. Just like a few people still murder, steal, and do other illegal things. The possibility that they’re going to do it anyway doesn’t make it right, or mean that murder and theft should be legal and available at special government-funded clinics.  \n  \n**8. Men shouldn’t be allowed to speak on the issue of abortion.**  \n  \nSo I guess fathers now have zero rights, including the right of free speech? Every pregnancy since the beginning of time has required three people: a woman, a man, and a child. Otherwise, there’s no pregnancy. And you think two of the three have no say at all?  \n  \nRegardless, most of the really, really passionately pro-life people I know are women. This isn’t a men-versus-women issue. Or if it is, it’s not in the way you probably think: the people who decided Roe v. Wade were all men. I guess that would mean their opinion doesn’t count either, does it?  \n  \nOne of the best explanations I’ve heard on this subject came from a woman, and I’ll just [quote her](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/10/i-don-t-know-if-i-m-pro-choice-anymore.html) here: “You can’t stand on the sidelines, especially now that you’ve seen these videos. These are babies that are being killed. Millions of them. And you need to use your voice to protect them. That’s what a man does. He protects children—his own children, and other children. That’s what it means to be a man.”  \n  \n**9. Abortion should be allowed if there’s something wrong with the child.**  \n  \nNow we’re getting into dangerous territory, where we start deciding whether someone else’s life is worth living. It’s the reason why a very high percentage of children with Down Syndrome are aborted, even though [99% of people with Down Syndrome say they are happy with their lives](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/opinion/the-truth-about-down-syndrome.html?_r=0). Does somebody with a below-average IQ not deserve to live? If someone is missing a limb—or [missing all their limbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Vujicic)—does that mean they wouldn’t choose to live? It’s simply not our decision to make. ([See my friend Rick, and his son Noah, for some perspective.](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/message/3442))  \n  \n**10. Without abortion, some of these children would grow up poor, unwanted, or unloved.**   \n  \nThis just takes the previous argument, where we decide in advance if someone else’s life is worth living, and applies it in an even more extreme way. Are you saying that it’s better for a child to be dead than to be poor, or grow up with less-than-ideal parents?  \n  \nConsider how many great people came out of difficult upbringings. You might have chosen to abort Martin Luther King, Albert Einstein, Oprah Winfrey, Allen Iverson, and many others. Nobody has a perfect childhood. Yet every adult I know would disagree quite strongly, and defend themselves vigorously, if you decided their life wasn’t worth living and tried to end it for them. Regardless, adoption is an option, so no one is being forced to raise a child they truly don’t care for.  \n  \n**11. What if abortion is necessary to save the mother’s life?**  \n  \nPeople always bring up the exceptions, and instead of letting them be exceptions, use them to argue for abortion in any circumstance. Yes, being pro-life means that there can be an exception if it’s needed to save the life of the mother.  \n  \nHowever, besides being very rare, these cases aren’t even really what we talk about when we talk about abortion. In the case of an [ectopic pregnancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy), when the embryo is growing outside the uterus and there is zero chance of the child surviving, of course it makes sense to save the life of the mother. But that’s a different type of procedure, and isn’t even referred to as an abortion, except by some pro-abortion advocates.  \n  \nThe other way a mother’s life could be seriously at risk is if she is diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer while pregnant. Treatment would kill the child, but if the mother would not survive without immediate treatment, that is called a “medically necessary” abortion. Allowing medically necessary procedures does not mean you have to also allow medically unnecessary abortions.  \n  \n**12. What about abortion in the case of rape?**  \n  \nRape is terrible. It’s a horrible, horrible wrong that happens far too often. However, only 1% of all abortions are the result of rape, and [that’s according to the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3711005.pdf).  \n  \nIf you’ve been raped, you know firsthand how awful it is to have something horrible happen to you when you have no say in the matter. What happened to you is not right. However, if it resulted in pregnancy, you have the opportunity to do something very powerful: to redeem it. No child deserves to die for someone else’s crime.  \n  \nI met an adult woman recently who had just learned that she had been conceived in rape. Though that was obviously hard for her to hear, it was also obvious that she was using her life daily to help others. Much good came from her mother’s decision to not have an abortion.  \n  \nIf someone argues for abortion because of the possibility of pregnancy from rape, ask them if they would _at least_ follow a law that prevents the other 99% of all abortions? If they’re not willing to support such a law, then they’re just using this objection dishonestly, as an excuse to allow abortion for any reason.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Beyond Belief**  \n  \nSo far, I’ve intentionally left out any references to the Bible; these arguments against abortion are based solely on facts and logic. I’ve done that for a reason: to show that any thinking person, regardless of belief, should be opposed to abortion.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you are a Christian, though, and somehow still consider yourself pro-choice, [watch this podcast](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/message/3170) about what your professed faith does have to say about abortion. Abortion is wrong without exception.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you have been part of an abortion, check out the end of [last week’s post](http://theporch.wpengine.com/planned-personhood/).  \n  \n  \n  \nThere’s one more argument that you _don’t_ hear very often, even though it’s the most honest objection and is the main reason for most elective abortions. It’s this: “Better to take the child's life than to have them inconvenience yours.” Children can be unbelievably inconvenient, and pregnancy can be really embarrassing in certain situations. Some of the circumstances above, like having a child with special needs, can make it seem even more inconvenient.  \n  \n  \n  \nPersonally, I think all children are a blessing, but this might be a case where we have an honest difference in beliefs. So the question really comes down to this: does your inconvenience, however great, outweigh a child’s right to live? Is it justifiable to end someone else’s life, just so your lifestyle doesn’t have to change?  \n  \n  \n  \nSadly, right now our society’s official and legal answer to that question is “yes.” But that needs to change. And in a democracy like ours, it’s up to us to change it.  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[The Power of Being Faithful](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-power-of-being-faithful/)  \n[Should Dr. Gosnell Be On Trial?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-dr-gosnell-be-on-trial/)  \n[Why You Should Vote](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-you-should-vote/)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"7z3BpRJ0FqEqKO24eGisEK"}}},"url":{"en-US":"12-bad-reasons-to-support-abortion"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/12-bad-reasons-to-support-abortion/"}}},

I was in junior high. Some coed friends and I were playing spin the bottle and it eventually landed on my “crush.” After we kissed, I couldn't sleep that night. Not a wink. I had definitely “awakened love before its time.” Which wasn’t smart, because there was no way it could end well. A kiss either leads to more or it leads to a breakup—but in junior high it doesn't lead to marriage anytime soon.  \n  \n  \n  \nLater in life, when marriage actually was a possibility, each dating relationship carried the question of when we should first kiss. I wish I could say I was wise about it, but the ignorance of junior high continued, and therefore I was driven more by emotions and desires. I ended up going further than I should have physically, which I would later regret.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor some people, whose main goal in dating is to have sex as quickly as possible, the question of when to first kiss may seem irrelevant. But if you are following Christ and therefore care about the fact that [the Bible says premarital sex is a sin](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/), and like all sin is simply [not the best God has for you](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/), then the question about when to start kissing before marriage becomes more important. When is it wise? Is it ever a sin to kiss someone you’re dating? The question comes up even more when you see people who wait until their wedding to have their first kiss. Is that the way it’s supposed to be done? Is that why the ceremony says, “You may _now_ kiss the bride”?  \n  \n  \n  \n**What the Bible Says**  \n  \nThe Bible doesn’t say a whole lot about dating, because dating as we know it is a modern invention. The Bible talks about being single, then engaged, and then married. It doesn’t talk about being single, dating, dating some more, hooking up, hanging out but not really dating, living together but not being married, swiping left and right, etc. That doesn’t mean the Bible is out-of-date; it may mean that [we’re just doing this whole dating thing wrong](https://www.facebook.com/watermarkchurch/videos/vb.20995091208/10153739418801209/?type=2&theater).  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Bible does talk quite a bit about kissing, including at least one clear instance of kissing before marriage. In fact, in that case (Genesis 29:11), you have a guy (Jacob) kissing his future wife (Rachel) the first time they meet, sort of like a first date. However, kissing was more of a common greeting then, like a hug or a handshake today; the Bible also talks about Jacob kissing his dad (Genesis 27:26-27), his brother (Genesis 33:4), and his uncle, whom he’d also never met before (Genesis 29:13). So we’re probably talking about pecks on the cheek, not open-mouth kisses with tongue. Also, just because Jacob did something doesn’t mean that it was necessarily right; he made a lot of questionable decisions.  \n  \n  \n  \nA more relevant verse is 1 Corinthians 6:18, which says to “flee from sexual immorality.” Now, kissing isn’t necessarily the sexual immorality that it’s telling us to flee from; it’s saying to flee from any kind of sex outside of marriage. But my question is: how do you flee from sex before marriage? Is an extended make-out session a way to “flee”? No; it’s a way to get as close as you can to sexual immorality without hopefully crossing the line. It’s the opposite of fleeing. And that means that kissing before marriage can be a sin, if it goes against 1 Corinthians 6:18.  \n  \n  \n  \nThere’s also 1 Timothy 5:1-2, which instructs Timothy, a young man, to treat “younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.” Now, of course you might kiss your sister, which means you could kiss a girl you are dating. But you would only kiss your sister in a certain way. You definitely would _not_ French kiss your sister, for instance. And it would be hard to say you’re acting “with absolute purity” if you did.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Practical Steps**  \n  \nSo what’s the answer?  \n  \n  \n  \nI’m not going to say you have to wait until your wedding to kiss, because the Bible doesn’t clearly say that. And where the Bible leaves things open, we have freedom.  \n  \n  \n  \nHowever, that doesn’t mean that waiting is a bad idea. I think it’s a great idea. It’s probably even be the best option. It’s just not a requirement.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you decide to kiss before marriage, you haven’t necessarily sinned. But there are some practical things to consider:\n\n  \n- **Make it a conscious decision.** In other words, decide beforehand whether you are going to kiss while dating, and decide when that would be appropriate. Then stick by that decision. This is opposed to just “letting things happen”; if you make your decisions about physical intimacy in the spur of the moment, you’re likely to go further and move faster than you otherwise wanted.\n  \n- **Talk about it.** Guys, this is part of being a leader in dating: you remove confusion and set out a plan or vision. If you think you shouldn’t kiss for the first 3 months, or 6 months, or 10 dates, or whatever you decide, talk with her about that. Don’t leave her wondering. You can explain that you are attracted to her—which may be an insecurity of hers—but you want to honor her and get to know her in a non-physical way.\n  \n- **Set ground rules.** As mentioned, there are different kinds of kisses. There are also different situations in which kissing can occur. So while you’re making decisions and talking about it as a couple, set some barriers regarding what kind of kissing is allowed and the situations you allow yourself to get into. For example, [our premarital class](http://theporch.wpengine.com/merge-dallas-premarital-class/) (for people who are engaged or seriously dating) encourages couples to sign a purity pledge that lists out a range of different physical activities, from holding hands to sex and everything in between. Light kissing might be allowed, whereas kissing the neck (or any place other than the lips or cheeks) is considered a step too far. Good ground rules might include “no kissing when alone at home” or “kissing is allowed only when we’re standing up, or have all four feet on the floor.”\n  \n- **Kissing can kill conversation.** Literally, you can’t talk while kissing. This is one of the very practical reasons to wait: you’re trying to get to know each other and make decisions about marriage. If making out becomes a major part of your time together, it can cut short that process of getting to know each other in a non-physical way. The physical stuff will be a _part_ of your marriage, but it’s not the _foundation_ of your marriage. Conversation builds the foundation.\n  \n- **Flee sexual immorality.** It’s a huge problem today, so it’s worth repeating. If your goal is to abstain from sex until marriage, don’t torpedo your own goal by adding extra temptation. Kissing is foreplay. It’s natural for you to want to go further once you start down that road. So if that’s at all a danger for you, don’t start down the road. There will be plenty of time for all of that after you get married.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nI’ve officiated my share of weddings, and I’ve never once heard someone say that they wished they had gone farther physically before marriage. I’ve never had someone say they regretted waiting so long to kiss. I do know people, myself included, who wished they had waited longer.  \n  \n  \n  \nAgain, I know for some people this kind of talk might sound crazy. But just a few generations ago, 90% of what we tend to do in dating today would have sounded crazy, while waiting until marriage for any kind of physical intimacy would have been the cultural norm. Based on things like marriage and divorce rates, their way worked out a lot better than today’s way.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen do you think people should kiss in dating?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[How Far Is Too Far?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-far-is-too-far/)  \n[How Long Should You Date Before Marriage?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-long-should-you-date-before-marriage/)  \n[Why Not Live Together?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/)  \n\n  \n<script>// <![CDATA[<br>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));<br>// ]]></script>  \n\n  \n\n  \n> [Tell Me](https://www.facebook.com/watermarkchurch/videos/10153739418801209/)\"Tell me we're getting better at this.

People who say one thing, but end up doing another.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Ashley Madison hack is just the latest public example. Apparently over 30 million people had signed up for the “have an affair” site, and all their info is now leaked online. With those numbers, you’d think there would be many well-known names exposed by the hack. But the only ones people seem to talk about are a couple of semi-famous Christians; they’re more newsworthy because of the hypocrisy angle to the story.  \n  \n  \n  \nYes, it’s true that some Christians can be hypocrites. And there are some reasons for that:  \n  \n  \n  \n**1. Because we are sinners.**  \n  \nSome people think of Christianity as a thing that you _do_; you follow a set of rules, you never sin, and _that_ is what makes you a Christian.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut that’s not really the case. The core of Christianity is realizing that you _are_ a sinner, and that you _can’t_ follow the rules on your own. That’s [why Jesus had to die](http://theporch.wpengine.com/losing-my-religion/)—to take on the punishment for our sin. I mean, if you could be good enough to get to heaven, then God wasted the death of His Son in an effort to save you. You aren’t good enough. He was perfect.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat doesn’t mean it’s OK to go on sinning, but it is part of our nature. In Romans 7:18-20 (and really all of [chapter 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7)), Paul talks about how even he still found himself sinning at times. And this was an Apostle, and someone who willingly died for his faith! So, yes, Christians can still sin, which can seem hypocritical.  \n  \n  \n  \n**2. Because we are farsighted when it comes to sin.**  \n  \nSin can be like body odor or bad breath: you smell everyone eles’s. Or, in this case, your “farsightedness” causes you to see everyone else’s. Jesus talked about this in Matthew 7:3-5, with the illustration of pointing out a speck in someone else’s eye when you have a 2x4 in your own eye. He specifically calls such a person a “hypocrite.”  \n  \n  \n  \nNow, this doesn’t mean that you can’t instruct or warn someone that something is a sin; the last part of those verses says to “first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.” Since sin brings consequences, it is loving to help someone else deal with their sin; just be sure to do so from a place of humility. This looks like acknowledging your own sin, and actively dealing with it first.  \n  \n  \n  \n**3. Because we want to be teachers of the law, not followers of the law.**  \n  \nRecently, someone who had been married several times told me, “I don’t need anyone telling me how to be married; I think I know.” He considered himself somewhat of an expert on marriage, while his track record said otherwise.  \n  \n  \n  \nSome people would much rather give instruction to someone else than receive it themselves. Their desire to insert themselves as “teacher” rather than earning the position faithfully sets them up for hypocrisy. James 3:1-2 says that not many believers should become teachers, because “we who teach will be judged more strictly.” That certainly applies in how the public reacts to hypocritical teachers.  \n  \n  \n  \n**4. Because we hide sin.**  \n  \nWe’re all sinners. The hypocritical part comes when someone pretends that they’re _not_ a sinner, even though we all are (1 John 1:8). Non-believers don’t need to see that you’re perfect and have it all together, especially since that’s not true. Christians aren’t “better,” we’re just forgiven for how much we’ve messed up.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt appears that Ashley Madison’s business model revolved around hiding sin. By hiding sin, you allow it to grow. But by confessing sin and exposing it to the light, you kill it (Ephesians 5:11-13; John 3:19-21).  \n  \n  \n  \n**5. Because some “Christians” aren’t Christians.**  \n  \nI’ve already acknowledged that Christians can act like hypocrites, but let’s be fair: not all “Christian hypocrites” are believers who get caught in sin. Some are just sinners who get caught pretending to be Christian. And it’s those instances that best fit the definition of “hypocrisy” above.  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is why I warn single Christians not to believe that someone is marriage material solely because you met him at Church, or he can quote a Bible verse or two. At least some such people are just predators who know they’ll have more success if they learn to blend in. The proverbial wolves in sheep’s clothing.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe point is, if you find one wolf in the flock, that doesn’t mean all sheep are wolves. And if you find one hypocrite who is pretending to be a Christian, that doesn’t mean real followers of Christ are that way (Matthew 7:21-23).  \n  \n  \n  \n**What You Should Do About It**  \n  \nIf you are a Christian, the application is simple: don’t be a hypocrite.  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. Know you’re a sinner.\n  \n2. Deal with your sin.\n  \n3. Be humble and lead from what you do, not from what you say others should do.\n  \n4. Make regular confession a normal part of your life.\n  \n5. Make sure you have believed the gospel, which says that you’re not perfect, but you have a Savior Who is.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you’re not a Christian: don’t dismiss Jesus offhand because of a few hypocrites. In fact, if you dislike hypocrites, Jesus is totally your guy. He’s the most anti-hypocritical person in history. Go read what He says in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

The DJ basically calls the guy (or girl) on the phone and asks if they’d like to go on another date with that person. If the answer is “no” (and the answer is almost always “no”), the DJ asks them what went wrong on the first date to cause them to lose interest. It’s usually a train wreck, which is the point of the program.  \n  \n  \n  \nThese train wrecks are all completely avoidable, though. If you want to save the embarrassment of having your dating mistakes aired on the radio, here are some first date tips that can help you _not_ end up on Second Date Update:\n\n  \n- **Don’t over-share.** Not on a first date, anyway. Yes, you want to get to know each other better, and yes, that means talking about yourself. But the first date is generally not the best time to delve into your most intimate secrets. A number of Second Date Updates have dealt with people made uncomfortable by learning too much, too soon. See also “[When Should I Share My Past?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/when-should-i-share-my-past/)”\n  \n- **Don’t go overboard.** It’s a first date, not a marriage proposal. Guys, she’ll probably appreciate you putting some thought into it and not just going through the drive-through at McDonald’s. But taking it too extreme in the opposite direction—say, showing up in a three-piece Armani suit and singing her a love song you wrote especially for her—can seem a little weird on a first date. Save it for an anniversary; she’ll love it then.\n  \n- **Put in at least a little effort.** This is the flip side of the above. One guy literally did take his date out for ice cream by going through the McDonald’s drive-through. If that was his plan—if he even had a plan—it wasn’t a very good one, and didn’t lead to a second date. You need to strike a balance between the two: [be intentional](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-date-intentionally/), but not intense. If you need some examples, [here are some first date ideas](http://theporch.wpengine.com/first-date-tips/) that are low-pressure but still count as legitimate dates.\n  \n- **Don’t go on a first date if there’s already no chance of a second date.** If you’re not ready for a relationship, then why try to start one? There’s really no good outcome here. Even if the date goes well, it will just result in someone being disappointed or hurt (and possibly calling a radio show) because the relationship won’t go anywhere.\n  \n- **Don’t date your sister.** You’d think this would go without saying, but [apparently not](https://www.facebook.com/KSCSDFW/photos/a.397875204046.197360.355588814046/10153672595034047/?_rdr=p&p=0&type=1). Treat them like your sister (1 Timothy 5:2), but make sure they aren’t literally your sister.\n  \n- **Don’t make assumptions.** On the very rare occasions that someone called up on Second Date Update actually _does_ want to go on a second date, often the reason they didn’t just ask for another date themselves is because they assumed the other person wouldn’t be interested. They’re so impressed by the person on the first date that they think he or she is simply out of their league. Guys, if you find someone who’d truly be great marriage material, ask her out. And if the date goes well, ask her out again. And eventually you might end up married to a great girl.\n  \n- **Be honest.** If you say you’re going to call, pick up the phone and call. “I’ll call you” is not a soft “no,” or a way to let someone down easy. It’s you specifically telling someone that you’re going to call them. So follow through, even if that means calling them to explain that you’ve decided not to ask them out again. Be a man of your word. Let your “yes” be “yes” and your “no” be “no.” Really, _every_ Second Date Update could be prevented by both parties just being open and honest with each other.\n  \n- **Leave each person better than you found them.** Make that your goal. Think about it: when you go on a first date, you’re really hoping (or should be hoping) that eventually you might be loving this person forever. So, even if the date goes badly and that’s not going to be the case, at least you can be kind enough to leave them in a good place. That includes being gently honest with them, and not leaving them hanging.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nOne bonus tip: if you _do_ end up on Second Date Update, and someone points out your dating mistakes, apologize. Most episodes end up with both sides becoming defensive and argumentative, instead of being gracious and taking the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. If they’d accept correction and strive to change, they might even be given a second chance.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn case you missed it, we’re currently going through a series about dating at [The Porch](http://theporch.wpengine.com/about-us/) called “Save the Date.” Come check it out each Tuesday evening at 7:00 in Dallas (7450 LBJ Freeway) or 7:30 in Fort Worth (6025 Camp Bowie Boulevard).  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat dating mistakes have you made?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Who Should I Date?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-should-i-date/)  \n[Don’t Date This Man](http://theporch.wpengine.com/dont-date-this-man/)  \n[Less Than 15 Dallas Date Ideas for Less Than $15](http://theporch.wpengine.com/less-than-15-dallas-date-ideas-for-less-than-15/)"},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-not-end-up-on-second-date-update"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-not-end-up-on-second-date-update/"}}},

That’s a good thing; it’s one of the best things that can be said about our generation.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut how do you accomplish that? How do you really make a difference with your life? _Can_ you make a difference with your life?  \n  \n  \n  \n**Everyone Has a Gift**  \n  \nIf you’re a Christ-follower, the Bible says that you have been given gifts to use (at least one; likely more), and that different people have different gifts (1 Corinthians 7:7). And God designed you and your gifts specifically so that you can make a difference (Ephesians 2:10).  \n  \n  \n  \n**Discovering Your Gifts**  \n  \nFiguring out what gifts you have is not as difficult as many think. You likely already know what they are, if you just think about it and look at your life so far. What are you naturally good at? What do you like doing? What are you passionate about?  \n  \n  \n  \nAt Watermark, we’ll occasionally [talk about a person’s SHAPE](http://www.watermark.org/message/739). SHAPE is just an acronym; it represents five different things about you that you should consider when figuring out where to serve. SHAPE stands for:\n\n  \n- **Spiritual gifts –** The gifts God has given you. Potential spiritual gifts are listed in places like Romans 12:6-8 and 1 Corinthians 12:4-11; [a full list with explanations can be found here](http://www.gotquestions.org/spiritual-gifts-list.html). They include teaching, giving, leadership, serving, and encouragement. If one of them describes you particularly well, it is probably one of your stronger gifts.\n  \n- **Heart –** What do you have a heart for? What are you passionate about? What problems in the world break your heart?\n  \n- **Abilities –** These are things you are good at that aren’t necessarily spiritual gifts. For example, photography is not a spiritual gift, but I know some people have are very gifted at photography. One of the abilities I first used when serving at the church was phone calling, because my job at the time involved calling people all day, and I’d become good at it.\n  \n- **Personality –** Are you extroverted, introverted, goofy, serious—standard personality test kind of stuff.\n  \n- **Experiences –** What life experiences have you gone through? This is where I’ve seen God really redeem some people’s pasts. Your biggest mistakes, or the worst things that have happened to you, can make you uniquely qualified to help other people who are facing similar circumstances.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n**Using Your Gifts**  \n  \nBy considering your spiritual gifts, heart, abilities, personality, and experiences, you can figure out what God’s been preparing you to do. Look for a service area that you have a heart for—something that you really want to make a difference in—and find out what their needs are. Likely, your gifts, abilities, personality, and experiences will make you a good fit to fill at least one of those needs. It’s a perfect recipe: you’ll be doing something you want to do, and you’ll be naturally good at it.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s true that some people may seem more gifted than others. And if you play the comparison game, this might make you feel less important, or that you have less to offer. However, God is the one who gives gifts, and He only expects you to use what you have.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30), some people were given more talents than others. (A “talent” in the parable was a quantity of gold, but it’s not a coincidence that we now call natural abilities or gifts “talents.”) One person had five talents, and was congratulated when he invested those talents to earn five talents more. Another person had only two talents, and used those to earn two talents more. Was he seen as less important because he produced less than half as much as the first person? No, they both received the same reward, because they both used what they’d been given. The only person who was criticized was the one who didn’t use the talent he had been given at all.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, yes, some people may be more naturally gifted. But all that means is that they have a bigger responsibility to use those gifts (Luke 12:48). Regardless, the Bible says that we’re in this together; we’re all part of one body, and sometimes those gifts that might seem like lesser parts are actually more important (1 Corinthians 12:12-27).  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd that brings up a very important point: we’re not meant to use our gifts in isolation. You were made to belong to a church. Believe it or not, your gifts actually belong to the church; that is why God gave them to you. The people most fulfilling their purpose in life are Christians who are deploying their gifts inside the church to change the world.

The most important commandment, or thing God has ordered us to do, is simply to love Him.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut how good are we at doing that, really?  \n  \n  \n  \nFor too many people, Christianity is seen as a checklist. Go to church: check. Get baptized: check. Don’t murder, steal, or lie: check, check, and…well, if I’m being honest…  \n  \n  \n  \nBy making it into a bunch of rules, you run the risk of missing the one “rule” that Jesus Himself says is most important: having a relationship with Him. Having deep affection for Him. Making Him the true love of your life.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo how do you do that? Well, just like in any long-term relationship, it takes work on your part. It’s not just about feelings or “falling in love”; it requires that you actively pursue God as He pursues you. That’s why the command includes not just loving Him with all your “heart,” but also your “soul,” “mind,” and “strength.”  \n  \n  \n  \nHere are some tips (not rules, not a checklist, but just some things that tend to work) to help you develop your love for God.  \n\n  \n- **Know Him.** You can’t have any kind of relationship with someone unless you know them. Not just know _of_ them, or admire them from afar, but actually know them personally. This is where you move from a checklist to a relationship. If you’re still trying to work your way to God instead of trusting in Christ’s work on the cross, or don’t know why [the gospel](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-gospel/) is good news, [drop us a line](http://theporch.wpengine.com/contact-us/).\n  \n- **Read His love letters.** In other words, spend time studying the Bible. It’s a big book, and He has _a lot_ to say to you there. When you read a love letter, you don’t just skim over it to get the general idea, or treat it as a chore because your lover expects you to read for 10 minutes every day. You _study_ it, weighing every line and considering the meaning behind every word.\n  \n- **Talk with Him.** Pray. Pray all the time. Imagine being married and being around your spouse 24 hours a day, and yet never saying a word to them—or just saying something ritualistic to them once a day before bed, or before every meal. I don’t think there’d be a lot of love in that relationship. So talk. Be intimate, sharing what you really think and feel. He can handle it.\n  \n- **Do the things that stir your affections for Him.** That’s a paraphrase from Matt Chandler, who gave me the idea: namely, that there are certain places or things that tend to make you feel closer to God. I can’t tell you what those are, because they’re different for everyone. For some, it’s getting out into nature. For others, it’s spending quiet time first thing in the morning over a cup of coffee. One person told me that listening to music by [Shane & Shane](http://theporch.wpengine.com/q-a-with-shane-shane/) is what stirs their affections for God. Whatever it is, make time for it, and make it an important part of your schedule.\n  \n- **Follow His advice.** Again, it’s not all about following a set of rules. But if God says in His Word that something is bad for you (or good for you), and if you trust Him, then you should strive to do what He says. We all still mess up, and there is forgiveness for that, but don’t willfully rebel and just decide that you know better than God (you don’t). If you’re married, and your spouse says to take out the trash, the loving thing to do is to take out the trash—not scatter it all over the inside of the house. Jesus addressed this specifically in John 14:15: “If you love me, keep my commands.”\n  \n- **Take part in what He’s doing.** When you’re getting to know someone and trying to show your affection, one way to do so is to take an interest in what they’re interested in. You might take up a sport that they love to play, or watch the kind of movies they like to watch. If you want to love God, you should care about what He cares about, and seek to accomplish [His will](http://theporch.wpengine.com/gods-will-for-you/).\n  \n  \n  \n  \nTaking part in God’s interests would include loving other people, which Jesus mentions as the second most important commandment (Mark 12:31). And loving them well would mean sharing the good news of the gospel with them, which is what God wants to happen (1 Timothy 2:3-4).  \n  \n  \n  \nHow are you kindling your romance with God?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[How He Loves](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-he-loves/)  \n[In Love With Jesus](http://theporch.wpengine.com/in-love-with-jesus/)  \n[Who Do You Say That I Am?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-do-you-say-that-i-am/)"},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-romance-god"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-romance-god/"}}},

We’ve touched on a lot of the questions in previous blog posts, but there’s at least one we haven’t written about:  \n  \n  \n  \n**When Should You Say “I Love You”?**  \n  \nThe really short answer would be “not before it’s true.” But how do you know if it’s true?  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen I first started to date (which was long before I should have), I remember wondering whether I was “in love” with a particular girl. I knew I _liked_ her, but did I _love_ her? Were my feelings strong enough that they crossed the line into the realm of love? Where was this imaginary line, anyway?  \n  \n  \n  \nMy problem was that I was defining love as a feeling. Though that is one definition of the word, it’s not a good thing to base a relationship on. Why? Because feelings change. I could easily feel “in love” with one girl one week, dislike her the next, and then feel “in love” with a completely different girl a few weeks after that. Now I have a hard time even remembering all their names. So saying “I love you” based on how I feel in the moment doesn’t really mean much, and doesn’t seem very honest in hindsight.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Bible talks more about [love as an action](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-love/), not a feeling. For example, we’re given commands to love (Mark 12:30-31; John 13:34; Ephesians 5:25). You can’t command someone to _feel_ a certain way; you can only command them to _do_ something.  \n  \n  \n  \n1 Corinthians describes love this way:  \n  \n_Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. – 1 Corinthians 13:4-7_  \n  \nAll of those are things you do, not things you feel. And that’s why the next verse says that “Love never fails.” Feelings would sometimes fail; but since love is an action, you can always love someone regardless of how you might feel at the moment.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Actions Speak Louder**  \n  \nSince love is an action, you can (and should) show that you love someone before you say it.  \n  \n  \n  \nSome people say the words “I love you” in order to build trust and try to get something out of the person they are dating (with that “something” usually being sex). True love does the opposite. It gives without trying to get anything in return.  \n  \n  \n  \nBefore saying “I love you,” demonstrate that you love them by:\n\n  \n- Sacrificing your own desires and pursuing purity in dating.\n  \n- Intentionally and clearly moving towards marriage.\n  \n- Not playing games.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nIf anyone says “I love you” but their actions don’t match up with the above, then they’re lying (or using the wrong definition of “love”). As Proverbs 20:6 says, “Many a man proclaims his own steadfast love, but a faithful man who can find?” Or, as Ephesians 5 says:  \n  \n  \n  \n_But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people…Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them._  \n  \n  \n  \nOr, as Todd has said, if a man says “I love you,” but his hand is moving towards anything other than a ring box, don’t trust him!  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, don’t say “I love you” before both of you can be sure it’s true. And you can be sure based on their consistent actions over a period of time. Show it before you say it.  \n  \n  \n  \nJust for reference, here are some answers to other dating questions we’ve covered:  \n\n  \n- [Who should I date?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-should-i-date/)\n  \n- [What does it mean to date intentionally?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-date-intentionally/)\n  \n- [How important is physical attraction?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-important-is-physical-attraction/)\n  \n- [Is it OK to use online dating sites or apps?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-christians-use-online-dating/)\n  \n- [Should a girl ask a guy out on a date?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-girls-ask-guys-out/)\n  \n- [Should I pray with my boyfriend/girlfriend?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-girls-ask-guys-out/)\n  \n- [How do you “guard your heart”?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-guard-your-heart/)\n  \n- [When should I share my past?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/when-should-i-share-my-past/)\n  \n- [When should I kiss in dating?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/when-should-you-kiss-in-dating/)\n  \n- [How far is too far?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-far-is-too-far/)\n  \n- [How do you know if they are “the one”?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-know-if-youve-found-the-one/)\n  \n- [How long should you date before marriage?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-long-should-you-date-before-marriage/)\n  \n- [Should we get married?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-we-get-married/)\n  \n- [Should we break up?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/9-signs-you-should-break-up/)\n  \n- [Why not live together?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/)\n  \n- [What should I do while I wait for God to bring me the right person?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-to-do-while-youre-single/)\n  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"2wHKUceHdOAWY8MWCKE6CA"}}},"url":{"en-US":"when-should-you-say-i-love-you"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/when-should-you-say-i-love-you/"}}},

With our recent [“Save the Date” series](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/series/406), I thought it might be fun to look at the lyrics of popular love songs and see what pop culture is saying about love.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor ideas, I looked at a few lists with titles like “The Best Love Songs of All Time” or “The Most Popular Wedding Songs.” One thing I realized pretty quickly is that a lot of love songs do get it more or less “right.” (By “right,” I mean it describes the kind of love that can support a lifelong marriage; the kind of love the Bible talks about.)  \n  \n  \n  \nBut there were also some songs that I was surprised would be on a list at all. You really want _that_ to be the first dance at your wedding? I’m not saying they are bad songs. But if you consider what they’re really saying, and the ideas you’re singing along with, you need to make sure you’re not also buying in to the ideas they’re selling.  \n  \n  \n  \n**_Fallin’_ by Alicia Keys**  \n  \nOne thing I want to be clear on is that these songs don’t get it “wrong” in describing how some relationships go. You may absolutely be able to relate the lyrics to your own real experiences. I’m just saying that these are relationships to avoid, and a definition of “love” that you shouldn’t set your heart on.  \n  \n  \n  \nLike in the lyrics to _Fallin’_:  \n  \n_I keep on fallin'_  \n_In and out of love_  \n_With you_  \n_Sometimes I love ya_  \n_Sometimes you make me blue_  \n_Sometimes I feel good_  \n_At times I feel used_  \n_Lovin’ you darlin'_  \n_Makes me so confused_  \n  \n  \n  \nThis song sums up the whole problem with “falling in love”: if you can fall into a feeling, you can (and will) fall back out at some point. [As I talked about here](http://theporch.wpengine.com/when-should-you-say-i-love-you/) a couple of weeks ago, the Bible describes love first and foremost as an action. It’s something you do. If you choose to actively love someone, the strong feelings will also come along with that. But during the times that the feelings aren’t there, you can still stay committed to actively loving them.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe very word “falling” implies that love is a force of nature, impossible to control. A promise, like the promises of a wedding vow, you _can_ control. You can choose to actively love someone every day from here on out.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Contrast with:** _I Swear_ by John Michael Montgomery and/or All-4-One  \n  \nYes, this song was a huge hit for both a country singer and an R&B group, and both at roughly the same time. And it happens to be a song I loved growing up. The lyrics get it mostly right, describing love as a choice and a promise:  \n  \n  \n  \n_I swear_  \n_By the moon and stars in the sky_  \n_I'll be there_  \n_I swear_  \n_Like the shadow that's by your side_  \n_I'll be there_  \n_For better or worse_  \n_Till death do us part_  \n_I'll love you with every beat of my heart_  \n_I swear_  \n  \n  \n  \n**_Stay With Me_ by Sam Smith**  \n  \nThis song sounds exactly like a love song, but the song itself claims that it’s not:  \n  \n  \n  \n_This ain't love, it's clear to see_  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s actually about a one-night stand. The problem is, in our culture, we sometimes get these things confused.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand_  \n_But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man_  \n  \n  \n  \nYou still need “love,” but that’s not what you’re getting in this story.  \n  \n  \n  \n_Oh, won't you stay with me?_  \n_'Cause you're all I need_  \n  \n  \n  \nBut it’s not all you need, because:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Deep down I know this never works_  \n_But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt_  \n  \n  \n  \nThis is really one of the saddest songs I’ve heard in a while. It’s about self-deception and being in denial. But it’s the kind of denial and self-deception many people use in justifying the choices they make in having sex before marriage or “hooking up.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**Contrast with:** _Let’s Stay Together_ by Al Green  \n  \nBased on the title, this song could be about the same thing as _Stay With Me_. Instead, it’s about staying together “forever,” and “whether times are good or bad, happy or sad.”  \n  \n  \n  \n**_Need You Now_ by Lady Antebellum**  \n  \nAnother one that sounds like a love song and made it onto several love song lists:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door._  \n_Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before._  \n  \n_And I wonder if I ever cross your mind?_  \n_For me it happens all the time..._  \n  \n_It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now._  \n_And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now._  \n_And I don't know how I can do without._  \n_I just need you now_  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s about drunk-dialing your ex at 1:15 a.m. Don’t think I need to say much else.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Contrast with:** _We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together_ by Taylor Swift  \n  \nLike, ever.  \n  \n  \n  \n**_I Think I Wanna Marry You_ by Bruno Mars**  \n  \nSurely there’s nothing wrong with this song, right? It’s about marriage! Well, there’s a smart attitude about marriage and then there’s a “dumb” one:  \n  \n  \n  \n_It's a beautiful night,_  \n_We're looking for something dumb to do_  \n_Hey baby_  \n_I think I want to marry you_  \n  \n  \n  \nTelling someone that it would be “dumb” to marry them is not the greatest proposal ever. That’s probably because he’s drunk:  \n  \n  \n  \n_Who cares if we're trashed got a pocket full of cash we can blow_  \n_Shots of patron_  \n_And it's on girl_  \n  \n  \n  \nThe most telling part about the song’s attitude toward marriage is this line:  \n  \n  \n  \n_If we wake up and you wanna break up that's cool_  \n_No, I won't blame you_  \n_It was fun girl_  \n  \n  \n  \nThough few people take it to that extreme, there are many who look at marriage as a contract of convenience. If, at some point, they decide that marriage isn’t working out for them, then getting a divorce is seen as OK. It’s worked its way into the legal system as a “no-fault divorce.” But that’s way different than [Jesus’ instructions on marriage and divorce](http://theporch.wpengine.com/jesus-crazy-talk-on-divorce/).  \n  \n  \n  \n**Contrast with:** _I Won’t Give Up_ by Jason Mraz  \n  \n  \n  \n_I won't give up on us_  \n_Even if the skies get rough_  \n_I'm giving you all my love_  \n_I’m still looking up_  \n  \n  \n  \n**_Marry Me_ by Train**  \n  \nThis song sounds like it gets it right. It’s about marriage, and a lifelong commitment, and living out that commitment every day. There’s only one small problem: the guy making this lifelong commitment to the girl hasn’t even asked her out on a first date yet.  \n  \n  \n  \n_If I ever get the nerve to say_  \n_Hello in this cafe_  \n  \n  \n  \nAt first I thought I was hearing it wrong, but the video for the song confirmed it. He’s never even spoken to this girl. So the song’s really about the idea of love at first sight. Love based only on the way someone looks isn’t love; it’s lust.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Contrast with:** _Will You Still Love Me_ by Lana Del Rey  \n  \n_Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?_  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s a really good question to ask, or at least make sure you know the answer to:  \n  \n  \n  \n_I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will_  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat love song lyrics have you noticed that get it wrong (or right)?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[How to Guard Your Heart](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-guard-your-heart/)  \n[5 Mainstream Movies That Are Secretly About Jesus](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-mainstream-movies-that-are-secretly-about-jesus/)  \n[Sounds Like “Fun.”](http://theporch.wpengine.com/sounds-like-fun/)\n\n"},"url":{"en-US":"how-love-songs-get-it-wrong-or-right"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-love-songs-get-it-wrong-or-right/"}}},

One big reason we talk about being in community is because it’s the best way to get wise counsel, avoid mistakes, and make smart decisions.

It’s what we mean when we talk about “dating in community.” But what does that look like? How do you “date in community”? Does it mean you only go on group dates? That you let your community group decide who you should date? Is there some kind of interview process where your community group grills a prospective suitor to see if they are worthy of the job?  \n  \n  \n  \nTo help clarify, here are some details on what we mean by “dating in community,” and how your community group friends can be a big help to you as you navigate your way through a dating relationship.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Before You Date**  \n  \nBefore you ask anyone out, or agree to start a dating relationship, your community group should help you decide if that’s a good idea. Here are some things you should process together:\n\n  \n- Are you healthy and mature enough to date? Are there hurts, habits, or hang-ups that you need to heal from first? Dating (and marriage) won’t cure your problems; it will just put a magnifying glass on them.\n  \n- What is your intention in dating? Is it to find and pursue someone towards marriage, or is it to just have a good time for the weekend? If it’s the latter, a biblically-based community should try to help you see why that might not be a good idea.\n  \n- What type of person are you looking to ask out or be asked out by? Does this line up with who God tells you to look for?\n  \n  \n  \n  \nYour community should agree that you are healthy enough to date, have the right intentions in dating, and are looking for the right type of person. If not, press pause on dating until you can agree that you’re fully lining up with God’s Word on these things.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Getting (and Going on) Dates**  \n  \nYour community group can help you get dates, and can also help make dating more fun, safe, and successful.  \n\n  \n- Introductions: your community knows you, and they also know other people. Chances are, some of those people might be great for you to date! Ask your community to help you meet others who they think would be a good fit for you.\n  \n- Decisions: when you’re planning to ask someone out, run it by your community group to get their counsel. Or, if you've been asked out and are considering taking the relationship from \"just a date\" to \"dating,\" see if your community agrees it's a good idea. Keep getting their input as you continue progressing in the relationship.\n  \n- Learn from their mistakes and successes. What have they done in dating that you should avoid? What have they done in dating that you should try to imitate (Proverbs 22:3)?\n  \n- Dating together: don’t only go on one-on-one dates; at least part of the time, take someone from your community group along for a fun double date. Better yet, get both of your community groups together. The more eyes on the relationship, the better (Proverbs 15:22).\n  \n  \n  \n  \n**Growing the Relationship**  \n  \nAs you spend time dating someone, whether it’s date #1 or date #100, your community group can provide perspective from God’s Word (most important), as well as advice from any experience they have (less important, but still helpful). Here are some things to talk about in growing your relationship:  \n\n  \n- Set healthy boundaries for physical, emotional, and spiritual intimacy. Ask your community group to keep you accountable to those standards.\n  \n- Ask for their feedback on what you are doing well, and what areas they think you could grow in. One helpful piece of framework is keep-start-stop: what should you _keep_ doing, _start_ doing, or _stop_ doing? Be brave enough to ask your date’s community group what they think too.\n  \n- Talk through any expectations, fears, or insecurities that may be holding you back. Don’t let these derail what could otherwise be a great relationship.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nProverbs 11:14 says that where there is no guidance, the people fall, but in an abundance of counselors there is victory. Whether it’s [ending an unhealthy relationship](http://theporch.wpengine.com/9-signs-you-should-break-up/), maintaining a healthy one, or [taking a great one to the altar](http://theporch.wpengine.com/get-married-already/), your community group can help you experience victory in dating.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat questions do you have about dating in community?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Luke Friesen)  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Who Should I Date?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/who-should-i-date/)  \n[How to Date Intentionally](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-date-intentionally/)  \n[What's the Big Deal About Community?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/whats-the-big-deal-about-community/)"},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-date-in-community"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-date-in-community/"}}},

That’s not meant to be negative or make you feel bad; it’s just a fact. So far, dating hasn’t worked out for you.  \n  \n  \n  \nI’ve been there. I went through my share of failed dating relationships when I was single. Why did they fail? There are many reasons, but often it was because of my own mistakes. It was heartache or frustration or wasted time that could have been prevented.  \n  \n  \n  \nNow that I work in a young adult ministry with a few thousand singles, I see the same dating mistakes happening over and over again. I’d like to help you avoid them. So, in no particular order, here are nine of the most common dating mistakes I’ve seen:  \n  \n\n\n  \n1. **Dating for fun, not for marriage.**\n  \n  \nEither you’re heading for marriage, or you’re heading for a break-up. So if marriage isn’t your goal, or isn’t even an option, you’re basically guaranteeing the relationship will fail. Your best-case scenario is that it fails quickly, before anybody can get seriously hurt.  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. **Trusting feelings over facts.** \n  \n  \nFeelings are unreliable. Feelings change. I’m not saying you shouldn’t have feelings for the person you’re dating, but it becomes a problem when they blind you to the facts. They can cause you to gloss over obvious red flags or ignore [signs you should break up](http://theporch.wpengine.com/9-signs-you-should-break-up/). Conversely, a lack of an instant “spark” can cause you to ignore or quickly give up on someone who would actually be a great match—and whom you might develop feelings for after a few dates of getting to see how awesome they are.  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. **Dropping your friends/community and spending all your time with the person you’re dating.**\n  \n  \nThis plays right into the tendency to be blinded by feelings. Those who know you best and who care about you as a friend are great resources in dating. Since they’re not “in love” with your boyfriend or girlfriend, they should be able to more clearly see whether this person is a good potential spouse for you.  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. **Being driven by fear.**\n  \n  \n“What if nobody else comes along and I’ll be single forever” is probably not a good way to make decisions on dating and marriage. Even if it were true, being single is better than being in a relationship with the wrong guy or girl.  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. **Pursuing the wrong people.** \n  \n  \nSo you’re attracted to “bad boys”? Well, by definition, they’re never going to be good for you. Think you can overlook the fact that you don’t share the same faith because you share a love of _Doctor Who_? Then you’re prioritizing the relationship over the Lord, and dating is your true god.  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. **Focusing on physical attractiveness.**\n  \n  \n[Physical attraction is less important than you think.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-important-is-physical-attraction/) It can be a factor, but it shouldn’t be a main factor. Looks are guaranteed to change over time. So, if that’s all you’re interested in, then you already know that you’ll eventually lose interest.  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. **Going too far physically.**\n  \n  \n[How far is too far?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-far-is-too-far/) As we [talked about a couple of weeks ago](http://theporch.wpengine.com/when-should-you-kiss-in-dating/), sometimes even kissing can be too far (or can increase the temptation to go further). Premarital sex can cause you to stay in a bad relationship far longer than you should, make breakups more painful, [complicates future relationships](http://theporch.wpengine.com/discussing-your-sexual-past/), and has [other consequences](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/). Instead of moving you closer to marriage, [it tends to slow down that process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1&v=cO1ifNaNABY).  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. **Not being honest.**\n  \n  \nIf you’re trying to be what he or she wants you to be—instead of just being who you are—then you’ve fallen into this dating mistake. They’re not even really dating you; they’re dating an imaginary person, a fictional character that you’ve made up. Eventually the charade will fall, and it rarely ends well.  \n  \n  \n\n  \n1. **Not asking.**\n  \n  \nIf you ask her out, she might say “no,” but she might say “yes.” Even if it feels like a long shot, there’s still at least a small chance you’ll succeed. If you don’t ask, your odds remain at 0%.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat’s not _all_ the dating mistakes you can make, but it’s some of the big ones.

But don’t complain the next time a sermon goes long.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you’re looking for “the one,” or your “soul mate,” and you define that as being the one person in all the world who is perfect for you—they don’t exist. You’ll never find them. They’re off riding unicorns with Bigfoot.  \n  \n  \n  \nThat doesn’t mean you can’t love someone deeply, get married, and spend the rest of your lives together. In fact, the goal of this post is to make it more likely that you do exactly that. It’s just that there’s not _only_ one person in the whole world that you could do that with. As I’ve mentioned before, the Bible doesn’t say that there is, and [neither does logic or math](https://what-if.xkcd.com/9/).  \n  \n  \n  \nThe truth is, there may be any number of people out there who would be a great match for you and make a great spouse. Even just within The Porch crowd on any given Tuesday, I’d guess there are probably at least a few dozen possibilities. That’s not suggesting you should marry just anyone; but if there are a thousand people there of the opposite sex who share your faith, surely at least a small percentage would have the possibility of being a good match. Right? (Psst. Ask her out.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**The Problem With “The One”**  \n  \nThe reason why this matters is because thinking that you do have a perfect soul mate can lead to some real problems in dating and marriage.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn dating, it can keep you single far longer than you need to be—maybe forever. If you’re looking for someone who doesn’t exist, needless to say you’re going to have a really hard time finding them. When you do meet someone, any tiny flaw or minor difference may be seen as proof that they’re not “the one” for you.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt can also work the other way, causing you to rush into things or stay with someone longer than you should. If you become convinced that someone actually is your soul mate, then you’d tend to overlook red flags—even major ones. After all, you’re _meant_ to be together, right? If your closest friends all tell you that he or she is no good for you, you should probably listen to them. They’re usually right.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd there’s no such thing as “love at first sight.” Lust at first sight, sure. But if you don’t know anything about them other than how they look, then you don’t love them; you like something about them that will certainly change. Looks are a poor thing to base love on.  \n  \n  \n  \n**The One for You**  \n  \nWhen you marry someone, they do become “the one.” They’re the one you’ve committed to love for the rest of your life, and the two of you become one (Mark 10:7-8). They are still the one when they gain weight, lose weight, lose their job, get cancer, or make mistakes.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe idea of a perfect soul mate really causes problems within marriage. That’s because, no matter how awesome they may be, they’re still not going to be perfect. And as months and years go by, there will be times when they don’t inspire this magical feeling within you. So when you meet someone new, and different, and therefore exciting, there may be a temptation to think that _this_ person is your soul mate. That you somehow got it wrong when you married, and you were meant to end up with this new person instead.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnd that’s wrong. Verifiably wrong, since [studies show](http://theporch.wpengine.com/truths-about-marraige/) that people who divorce and then marry someone else don’t end up any happier in their new marriage. It’s because, again, you’re chasing something that doesn’t exist; no human being will make you perfectly happy.  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you’re looking for a soul mate, what you’re really looking for is Jesus. He actually is perfect, and is the only one who can truly satisfy your soul. So [love Jesus first, with all your heart](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-romance-god/), and then find someone who loves Him just as much and marry that person. Or, if you don’t marry, you’ll still be OK—because you’re not looking for someone else to make you complete.  \n  \n  \n  \n– JP\n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Should We Get Married?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/should-we-get-married/)  \n[How Long Should You Date Before Marriage?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-long-should-you-date-before-marriage/)  \n[Re-Redefining Marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/re-redefining-marriage/)\n\n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1ZENWfKkDeseyuaqE2SG6a"}}},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-know-if-youve-found-the-one"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-know-if-youve-found-the-one/"}}},

It’s the kind of thing where you get letters from the President and the state legislature passes special resolutions in your honor.  \n  \n  \n  \nSince The Porch has been talking about dating and how younger people today can make choices that will lead to a lasting marriage, I thought, why not ask the real experts on the subject? John and Helen graciously agreed to share some tips on how to stay married for 70 years (and counting). They each wrote their own response without reading what the other had to say first; I’ve consolidated their answers below.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How to Stay Married for 70+ Years**  \n  \n_By John and Helen Bloss_  \n\n  \n- **Get old.** I guess I would first say the obvious: you have to live to be 90+…and we have done that! A couple of days ago I was thumbing through a catalog and saw a knit shirt with the words “So far this is the oldest I’ve ever been.” We had a big laugh over it.\n  \n- **Laugh together.**\n  \n- **Be satisfied with what you have.** In every relationship, and especially marriage, there come rough spots. Economics is one. When we were married, one of us (John) still had 5 years of higher education yet to go. We “lived on a shoestring” in a very small apartment near the university where the rent was $5 a week. I (Helen) had a full-time job, which at that time paid a fairly good salary: $75 a month. We didn’t have a car at first and used the city bus, which was very economical. My parents were farmers/ranchers so they helped us by giving us meat occasionally. After John graduated from seminary and was hired as a pastor, we lived in a parsonage and didn’t have rent. And, we grew a vegetable garden. You can see from this that we lived _very frugally_. But we were satisfied with what we had and were happy together.\n  \n- **“Together” is an important word.** We never made big decisions alone. We did that together to see what the other was feeling about an idea. I remember once when Ruth (our youngest daughter) asked permission to do a certain thing…then added “Yes, I know, you have to see first what daddy thinks.”\n  \n- **“Divorce” was never an accepted word when we got married.** I would say to young people: if you are not sure about the other person and think, “well, if it doesn’t work out we can always get a divorce”…don’t marry him/her.\n  \n- **Communication must always be clear, honest, and NOT in angry words.** Folks have a tendency to say things they shouldn’t when they are mad.\n  \n- **Truth, trust, and faith are the foundation of every worthwhile relationship.** Without any one of those principles, no relationship can endure what the world throws at a family.\n  \n- **Marry someone you know.** I know there are untold numbers of organizations that try to help individuals find the “perfect match” for their clients. They may be fine for the insecure, or shy, but we found it better to do our own “investigation.” It only took two years.\n  \n- **Be a part of the Church.** There are at least two kinds of family: one God gives you by bloodlines, and then the family you create by being involved in a community of faith.\n  \n- **Understand what “love” really means.** Love that holds marriage together for many years is not what seems to be common today. Young and old have confused sexual intercourse for love. It isn’t. It does produce massive numbers of pregnancies, thousands of abortions, and the destruction of self-respect and positive attitudes toward life.\n  \n- **It’s about commitment.** When you get married, you are asked several times about your commitment to one another, and for any offspring you may have. Lasting marriage requires faithfulness to the vows made before humankind and before God. Don’t make yourself a liar! But remember God is a forgiving judge!\n  \n  \n  \n  \nYou can’t control how long you live (though you can control whether you make choices that sabotage your health). You can’t control what storms will come, though it’s guaranteed there will be storms (1 Corinthians 7:28). What you can control, and what makes a lasting marriage possible, is how you respond to those storms and stay committed to loving each other.  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Re-Redefining Marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-know-if-youve-found-the-one/)  \n[8 Truths About Marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/truths-about-marraige/)  \n[Get Married Already](http://theporch.wpengine.com/get-married-already/)"},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-stay-married-for-70-years"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-stay-married-for-70-years/"}}},

As in, are you currently not married?  \n  \nCongratulations! You have the gift of singleness.  \n  \nIf that freaks you out, we probably need to clarify what the gift of singleness is.\n\n#### **Single Forever?**\n  \nThere are a couple of different takes on what this “gift” actually is. Some think of it as a spiritual gift that enables you to remain single forever. It’s considered a gift because staying single can free you up to do more in serving the Lord. See 1 Corinthians 7:32-35, for example. It’s sometimes called the gift of celibacy, because [the Bible reserves sex for marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/), and so remaining unmarried would mean remaining celibate.  \n  \nThis idea of being called to remain single forever is why some single Christians are fearful that they might have the gift of singleness. It’s like the white elephant gift that nobody wants. For many people, it sounds more like a curse than a gift.  \n  \nBut if that’s how you feel about it—if having the gift of lifelong singleness is literally your greatest fear, ranking ahead of sharks and public speaking—then I’d venture that it’s pretty safe to say that you don’t have that gift. (Or at least not right now.) In Matthew 19:10-12, when Jesus talks about this gift, He says that there are eunuchs (people who physically cannot have sex), and “there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.” Note the word “choose.” We have free will. In practice, the gift of celibacy is probably the ability to _not_ be that concerned about getting married or having sex, so that you can freely choose to live life that way.  \n  \nPeople can change, so it’s possible that you may not have a gift now but develop it over time. But that’s also nothing to be afraid of. At one time, I didn’t feel called to ministry; I had no desire to be a pastor. But now there’s nothing I’d rather do. The same could be true with being called to singleness.  \n\n#### **Single Today**  \n\n  \nJust because you don’t have the gift of being single forever doesn’t mean you don’t have the gift of singleness today. As I said at the beginning, if you aren’t married, then you absolutely have the gift of singleness right now. You are single for this season of your life, and that is a gift. It’s a gift that is, in some ways, [better than marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-reasons-why-singleness-is-better-than-marriage-and-vice-versa/) (just like marriage is, in some ways, [better than being single](http://theporch.wpengine.com/5-reasons-why-marriage-is-better-than-singleness-and-vice-versa/)).  \n  \nThe problem is that people often don’t treat it as a gift. They see it as a curse, or a problem to be remedied, or a waiting period before you become “complete” by getting married. (Was unmarried Jesus not complete? Or Paul? Or Mother Teresa?) So instead of using the gift of singleness to build up the kingdom, they wait it out and waste it.  \n  \nHow should you be using your gift of singleness? [Here are some ideas](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-to-do-while-youre-single/). As a single person, you have more time, more freedom, and fewer responsibilities. You have the ability to study God’s Word more, share [the gospel](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-gospel/) more, and disciple more people. You can also date and look for a spouse; Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7:28 that there’s nothing wrong with getting married. But do so in a way that honors God and avoids unnecessary pain for yourself.

It is what caused man to fall in the Garden of Eden. It’s something that God specifically says He hates. It’s something that probably every person is guilty of. And though it’s not an unforgivable sin, it’s one sin that often causes people not to seek forgiveness—which means, from an eternal perspective, it might be the most damaging sin. We couldn't move on from our #ThouShall series without covering it. \n  \nWhat is it? It’s the sin of pride.\n\n#### **Why It’s a Sin**\n  \nSome people may look at that and wonder, why would pride be considered a sin at all?  \n  \nPride, or the kind of pride we’re talking about, is the attitude that you’re simply better or more important than somebody else. That you deserve some kind of status or reward because you’re just that good. I don’t mean that you can’t be happy if you’re rewarded for a job well done; being grateful is not pride. Pride is when you feel you’re entitled to a reward, and are upset and angry if you don’t get it.  \n  \nOne problem with such thinking is that it ignores what God has done for you. Let’s say you’re a fast runner. You may think that’s because of your own hard work and training (and that is part of it). But where did you get your legs? What use would all of your training be if you didn’t have those? As [GotQuestions.org](http://www.gotquestions.org/pride-Bible.html) puts it:  \n  \n_Pride is giving ourselves the credit for something that God has accomplished. Pride is taking the glory that belongs to God alone and keeping it for ourselves. Pride is essentially self-worship. Anything we accomplish in this world would not have been possible were it not for God enabling and sustaining us._  \n  \nAs for where the Bible says pride is a sin, it’s found throughout Scripture:  \n\n  \n- _To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. – Proverbs 8:13_\n  \n- _The Lord detests all the proud of heart. Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished. – Proverbs 16:5_\n  \n- _Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. Better to be lowly in spirit along with the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud. – Proverbs 16:18-19_\n  \n- _For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted. – Matthew 23:12_\n  \n- _All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, “God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.” – 1 Peter 5:5b_\n  \n  \nIt’s also listed first among “things the Lord hates” in Proverbs 6:16-19 (“haughty” is a synonym for “proud”), and it is pretty much the opposite of being “[poor in spirit](http://www.gotquestions.org/poor-in-spirit.html)” or “meek” as mentioned in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:3-5).  \n\n#### **The Root of Sin**\n  \nPride may not seem like such a bad thing when compared with some more obvious sins, but it is often the root cause of those sins. Wounded pride, for instance, can be the motivation for murder. Stealing basically says “I deserve this more than you do; my needs outweigh yours.”  \n  \nMore than that, though, pride is the historical root of all sin in the world. Satan was originally an angel; as described in Isaiah 14:12-15, he rebelled and was cast out of heaven because he wanted to be as important as God. When he then tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden, he appealed to that same sense of pride:  \n  \n_For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil. – Genesis 3:5_  \n  \nPride comes from us wanting to be God, and wanting to be worshipped as the best and greatest.  \n\n#### **Pride’s Destructiveness**\n  \nC.S. Lewis, who was far smarter than I am, called pride “The Great Sin” in his book _Mere Christianity_. You can read most of that chapter [in this PDF](http://www.timesandseasons.org/The_Great_Sin_condensed.pdf); better yet, read the whole book. In it, he talks about pride as the “one vice of which no man in the world is free; which everyone loathes when he sees it in someone else; and of which hardly any people, except Christians, ever imagine that they are guilty themselves.”  \n  \nOne point Lewis makes is that pride is always competitive. “Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man. We say that people are proud of being rich, or clever, or good-looking, but they are not. They are proud of being richer, or cleverer, or better looking than others. If every one else became equally rich, or clever, or good-looking there would be nothing to be proud about.” Pride is the comparison game, and when you play the comparison game, you always lose. It’s the one sure way to never, ever be happy or satisfied. As he puts it:  \n  \n_It is Pride which has been the chief cause of misery in every nation and every family since the world began. Other vices may sometimes bring people together: you may find good fellowship and jokes and friendliness among drunken people or unchaste people. But Pride always means enmity – it is enmity. And not only enmity between man and man, but enmity to God._   \n  \n_In God you come up against something that is in every respect immeasurably superior to yourself. Unless you know God as that—and, therefore, know yourself as nothing in comparison—you do not know God at all. As long as you are proud you cannot know God. A proud man is always looking down on things and people: and, of course, as long as you are looking down, you cannot see something that is above you._  \n  \nPride can make you miserable in this life, but the real danger is how it can impact your eternal life to come. Pride says that “I’m good enough,” and that “what I’ve done is worthy of reward.” And I’ve talked with many people who believe that they are going to heaven because they are “good enough,” and their good works outweigh their bad.  \n  \nThe problem is that _no one_ is good enough, and that _no one_ deserves eternal life. Isaiah 64:6 says that “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags.” They don’t add up to anything good, no matter how many there are. And in Matthew 18:23-27, Jesus uses a parable to describe our debt to God as 10,000 talents of gold—a ridiculously large amount, equivalent to 200,000 years’ worth of wages. The point of using such a figure is to show that there is no way you could even possibly dream of paying it back. You can’t do enough to pay for your sins yourself; if you think you can, or think that your sins really aren’t that bad, then you’ve committed the sin of pride.  \n  \nAs in the parable, though, God can and will forgive our debt if we just accept that payment. Pride denies that such a huge debt exists, or claims that we can pay it on our own and refuses to accept the necessary help. When that happens, pride ends up being the greatest sin.  \n  \n– JP \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n  \n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"3mq6sUKQwgq4wIKqOIkuks"}}},"url":{"en-US":"the-greatest-sin"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-greatest-sin/"}}},

Then this holiday probably isn’t your favorite. I was talking with a single friend the other day about how so many folks in relationships misunderstand the sorrow that some feel on Valentine's Day. She said that there are particular days that are meant for celebration that can bring more pain than joy. Like Mother’s Day for a woman struggling with infertility, Christmas for a family living in poverty, or Valentine’s Day for someone who is single. In the midst of rose bouquets, jewelry commercials and heart-shaped chocolates, this holiday can bring more tears than smiles.  \n  \nI agree. It is hard. I want you to know that I know that. You are not invisible. You are not less. You are not any more broken than those of us who are married. You are loved, right here and now, by the God of the universe, no matter what your relationship status is. It can be hard to remember that while feeling sorrow about the human love that you may not be experiencing right now, but it’s important. Some of you just need to rest in that truth.  \n  \nMany of you may also be looking for something to “do” on this Valentine’s Day while you are single. There is an abundance of advice columns or guides available that attempt to tell you how to spend the holiday if you are without a date. They tend to be self-centered, though, focusing on ways to treat yourself—such as buying your own Valentine’s gift—or coping strategies to deal with your singleness “problem” ([or is it a gift?](http://theporch.wpengine.com/gift-of-singleness/)).  \n  \nIf being alone is the problem, though, dating yourself is a poor solution. What you really want is to love someone, and have them love you in return.\n\n#### **Loving Someone You’ve Never Met**\n  \nI’m here to say you can actually do that this Valentine’s Day, even if you spend it alone. Love is an action, not a feeling, and you can do things right now to actively love and serve your future spouse—even if you have not yet met them.  \n  \nHow can you love someone you haven’t even met? By intentionally and selflessly doing things to make yourself a better future husband or wife—a gift that, by the way, is vastly more important than chocolates, more loving than flowers, and [more valuable than jewels](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs%2031:10&version=NIV1984). In short, work to be the person who the one you’re looking for, is looking for.  \n  \nBelow are five ways you can love your future husband or wife this Valentine’s Day.  \n\n  \n1. **Pray for your future spouse.** If you are going to be married someday, the person you will marry is out there right now, perhaps also spending Valentine’s Day alone. Pray that they are walking closely with Christ and growing in their relationship with Him. Pray that each of you would become a more godly man or woman during this season.God is in control, so praying to Him is the single most powerful thing we can do.\n  \n2. **Study the Bible.** <u>You will never have more time than right now</u> to study and learn the Bible. Build up your knowledge now, while you are single, so that you are ready to apply it when you are dating, married, or raising a family.\n  \n3. **Be financially responsible.** Being single on Valentine’s Day gives you a head start here, since the people who do celebrate the holiday spend an average of $142 per person on gifts and dates. Though common advice often includes going shopping for yourself or taking the day off, a better idea would be to work and save money for future gifts or expenses.\n  \n4. **Take care of yourself physically.** Just be healthy. Again, being single provides an advantage: no boxes of chocolate or fancy, sedentary dinners, and you have more time to devote to your health.\n  \n5. **Guard your heart and mind.** [Don’t follow your heart; inform your heart.](http://www.watermark.org/media/dating-directions/2441/) Avoid indulgence of the flesh, such as sitting and sobbing your way through a romantic movie marathon, or looking at porn. Honor your future spouse by not lusting over someone else’s or setting up unrealistic expectations. And instead of envying someone else’s relationship, the healthiest way to spend Valentine’s Day is to focus on your relationship with the One who already [loves you unconditionally](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-he-loves/).\n  \n  \nPut another way, you can love them best by striving to be content in your singleness, and not turning marriage or romance into an idol. It is natural to want a spouse, and it's OK to pray that you will find one. Just be careful not to make that desire ultimate. Ask God for help in balancing contentment in singleness and the pursuit of a spouse.  \n  \nAnd remember that love is not limited to just Valentine’s Day. You can do these things every day to become more the [type of man](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-woman-should-look-for-in-a-man/) or [woman that others should look for](http://theporch.wpengine.com/10-things-a-man-should-look-for-in-a-woman/). Hopefully that certain someone is out there doing the same, and therefore already loving you in return.  \n  \nHow are you spending your Valentine’s Day?  \n  \n– JP"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"3K22NMBrmUyAm0eSqaySEq"}}},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-spend-valentines-day-if-you-are-single"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-spend-valentines-day-if-you-are-single/"}}},

That’s why a lot of people, if they even think about fasting at all, tend to have questions about it. What is fasting? How do you fast? Why should you fast? What’s the deal with fasting, anyway?  \n  \n  \n  \n**What is Fasting?**  \n  \nFasting is the act of giving up something—food, in almost all cases—for a set period of time, in order to draw closer to God.  \n  \n  \n  \nAt least, that’s the Christian perspective. Any time you choose to go without food, for any reason, could be defined as a “fast.” (Even sleeping; that’s why “breakfast” is when you “break the fast” of the previous night.) But it’s not fasting the way the Bible talks about it unless the purpose is to focus on or improve your relationship with God.  \n  \n  \n  \nSo, for instance, if your goal is to lose weight, that’s not fasting as the Bible describes it. (Fasting to lose weight is also probably not a good idea, and can sometimes be a sign of anorexia; [get help](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/regeneration-recovery/) if that’s the case.)  \n  \n  \n  \n**Can You Fast From Just Certain Foods?**  \n  \nYou can, yes. Usually fasting means giving up all food, but there are variations in Scripture.\n\n  \n- Some fasts involve abstaining from food _and water_, as in Esther 4:16 and Acts 9:9. In both those cases it was limited to three days; you can’t really go without water for longer than that.\n  \n- You can fast from food but still drink water. In Matthew 4:2, after Jesus fasted for 40 days, it said He was hungry, but doesn’t say anything about Him being thirsty. (Also, unless a miracle was involved, a person would die without water after just a few days.)\n  \n- You can fast from certain types of food. In Daniel 10:3, Daniel fasted from “choice food,” meat, wine, and lotion (seriously) for three weeks. He still ate something; probably vegetables and water (Daniel 1:12).\n  \n- You can even fast from activities. 1 Corinthians 7:2-5 indicates that married couples can together choose to abstain from sex with each other “for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer.” You can debate whether that should be called fasting, since it has nothing to do with food, but it otherwise has the same purpose and characteristics as a fast.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nSo if you willingly give up coffee, or dessert, or possibly even television for a month, and do so for the purpose of focusing more on God, that could be considered a type of fast. But the clearest and strictest definition of the word “fasting” still means to give up all food for a time.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Are Christians Required to Fast?**  \n  \nFasting is not a requirement for salvation. Fasting will not help you get into heaven, just like no amount of good works can get you into heaven. We’re [not saved by religious observances](http://theporch.wpengine.com/losing-my-religion/); we’re saved if we accept [Jesus’ free gift of salvation](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-gospel/).  \n  \n  \n  \nThough it’s not a requirement for salvation, we are still expected to fast. In Matthew 6:16-18, Jesus twice says “when you fast,” which assumes that you do fast sometimes. And in Matthew 9:14-15, Jesus explained that although His disciples didn’t fast while He was with them, soon He would be gone and “then they will fast.” Jesus doesn’t command you to fast, but He endorses it and seems to expect it (and practiced it Himself). It is an act of obedience and faithfulness, just like prayer or reading your Bible.  \n  \n  \n  \n**When Should You Fast?**  \n  \nSome works-based religions do require fasts at certain times of the year. But grace-based Christianity doesn’t require such rituals. You have the freedom to fast or not fast anytime you want.  \n  \n  \n  \nIn the Bible, it was common for people to fast when seeking the Lord’s guidance on big decisions, or before starting a new ministry (Acts 13:2-3). David fasted as he prayed for his son to recover from an illness (2 Samuel 12:16), and to humble himself (Psalm 35:13). Ezra and Nehemiah each fasted to confess and mourn sin (Ezra 10:6 and Nehemiah 1:4-6). Jesus fasted before being tempted by Satan (Matthew 4:1-4). The common theme seems to be that people fasted when they really wanted to seek and follow God.  \n  \n  \n  \n**How Long Should You Fast?**  \n  \nIt’s up to you. You can fast by just skipping one meal, or you can fast for a day, or for several days. If you plan to fast for more than a few days you should first ask your doctor (or before fasting at all if you’re pregnant, diabetic, or have some other medical condition). Jesus fasted for 40 days. Yes, He’s Jesus, but some other people have fasted that long; one of them, Bill Bright, has [a PDF guide to fasting you can read here](http://calvarywilliamsburg.org/cms-assets/documents/193523-174607.7stepsprayerfasting.pdf).  \n  \n  \n  \nIf you’re just giving up something non-essential, like coffee, you could fast for many weeks or months.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Why Should You Fast?**  \n  \nSo what’s the point of fasting?  \n  \n  \n  \nThere’s something about going without food that helps you focus on God. For starters, choosing to give up food proves to yourself how serious you are about praying and listening to God. The hunger can serve as a constant reminder that you’re committed to praying. You have more time to pray, since you’re not cooking, cleaning, and eating.  \n  \nIt’s an exercise in trust; in Bible times, when there was less certainty about where your next meal would come from, willingly skipping meals meant you trusted that God was in control.  \n  \n  \n  \nFasting also strengthens your resolve to overcome sin. When fasting, you are intentionally not following your natural urges, which can include your urge to sin.  \n  \n  \n  \nEven if you’re just fasting from your favorite food, or from that one thing you feel like you can’t go a day without, it refocuses your priorities and keeps that thing from becoming an idol in your life.  \n  \n  \n  \n**Conclusion**  \n  \nThis Thanksgiving, eat responsibly, and give thanks to God for all that He’s provided you. And then, plan a time to go without some of those provisions so that you might grow closer to Him.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat other questions do you have about fasting?  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Thanksgiving and the Tenth Leper](http://theporch.wpengine.com/thanksgiving-and-the-tenth-leper/)  \n[Choosing Ramen](http://theporch.wpengine.com/choosing-ramen/)  \n[When God Doesn’t Hear](http://theporch.wpengine.com/when-god-doesnt-hear/)"},"url":{"en-US":"fasting"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/fasting/"}}},

When I was 20, I was hoping to beat my friends at Madden on Super Nintendo.  \n  \nThere are those moments, however, where you are looking for an adult only to find out you are one, sort of. Here you are, all independent and stuff. So I asked my friends (Facebook friends that is…and my 32 Twitter followers) what makes them feel like an adult. Here are the top 10 answers I got back.  \n\n#### **Bedtimes.**\n  \nLife has come full circle. You have bedtimes when you're young. In college, you sleep in class. And then, you're back to bedtimes again. Only now, you’re the one setting them (talk about responsibility!). Once upon a time we were dreaming of 10PM. Now, we're dreaming at 10PM.  \n\n#### **Setting an alarm clock.**\n  \nNothing says getting old like getting up early. King Solomon described it as “rising with the sound of birds” (Ecclesiastes 12:4). Yup. Whether it’s birds or your iPhone alarm that you forgot to turn off the one day you could sleep in! Ugh. But you only snoozed once. That's right Mr. Alarm, I'll get up when I’m good and ready...in 15 minutes. #Adulting  \n\n#### **Paying taxes.**\n  \nMatthew 22:21 is maybe my least favorite Bible verse. How did this happen? You don’t make much, and suddenly you have to pay what little you have left over?! What about that extra charge that gets added whenever you buy something? I thought that was paying taxes. Income, shmincome.  \n\n#### **Paying bills.**\n  \nSo this is what your parents were always arguing about. Electric, Water, Cable, Internet, and Trash? Do you really need electricity? The modem is plugged in and the TV doesn’t work without it. Got it. What about Water?  \n\n#### **Setting your own Doctor appointments.**\n  \nThat's because you have your own shiny plastic health insurance card. Bring it on flu!!! You can make the call, and get a Z-Pak. What? That doesn't treat the flu? You better get a flu shot then, on YOUR insurance. #winning.  \n\n#### **Changing your oil.**\n  \nA girl submitted this one, so I asked her whether she changed her own oil (?!). “Certainly”, she replied. I said, “that’s impressive. Where did you learn to do that?” She answered, “I don’t know, one day I just pulled into the oil change place and it happened!”  \n\n#### **Saving for retirement.**\n  \nNothing says “welcome to the working world” like planning to quit forever. It’s ironic how these two go hand in hand.  \n\n#### **Buying an appliance.**\n  \nThat’s your toaster. You own it. You worked hard for it. You might even leave it in your will.  \n\n#### **Getting your own cell phone plan.**\n  \nAnd by “your own cell phone plan” I mean making up a group so that you can get on the “family shared plan” together but not actually be family, because you’re too grown up for that!  \n\n#### **Taking your dry cleaning.**\n  \nBecause nothing says “adulting” like stiff pants with creases. You did it. You’re all grown up. Mom! Look at me now!  \n  \nThe apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13:11, _When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me._   \n  \nWhile I don’t think this passage is actually about growing up, I think the passive admonishment of this verse is suitable. There is a time to put childish ways behind us. This has little to do with vehicle maintenance, healthcare, and bills. To find out what it is actually talking about, join us on Tuesdays [‪at 7PM](x-apple-data-detectors://22/) at The Porch. When I look at today's young adults, I see world changers wanting to go all in to change this world for Jesus. Join us!

We talked about this [last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/3972), and it is GOOD NEWS. Since this is Easter weekend, there’s a solid chance that you’re planning on going to church on Sunday. Wherever you attend, hopefully you’ll be reminded of the incredible truth that trusting in Christ’s death and resurrection sets you free from the penalty of your sins – [which is death](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A23&version=NIV).  \n  \nBut Easter Sunday doesn’t happen without Good Friday. Your sins deserve condemnation, and freeing you from that didn’t come cheap, because in God’s perfect justice system, blood has to be shed in order for there to be forgiveness (Hebrews 9:22). So to get us to the awesome message in Romans 8:1, we first have to ask a really important question:  \n  \n“Why did Jesus have to die?”  \n  \nI remember asking that question when I was a kid. I knew the Easter story: that Jesus was God’s Son, who lived as a human, died on a cross, and rose from the dead on the third day. I believed that as a historical fact. But _why_ did that happen? What was the point?  \n  \nSee, I grew up quite religious. I went to a religious school, and literally won the “Religion Award” eight of the nine years I attended. To me, being a Christian meant following all the rules: not doing anything bad, and trying to do or be good. But that didn’t explain why Jesus would willingly die on a cross (which is the most painful form of execution ever invented). Couldn’t He just tell us to “be good” and then be done with it?  \n\n#### **Not Good**\n  \nThere was another aspect of being the “good kid” that troubled me. It’s that I wasn’t actually very good. I knew enough about the “rules” to understand that I was breaking them regularly.  \n  \nIt got worse as I grew older, until eventually I gave up any pretense of even trying. Odds are, whatever you’ve done, I’ve probably done it too. Sex, pornography, alcohol, drugs, materialism, arrest record—all the usual suspects.  \n  \nAs a young adult living in Dallas, I would still go to church occasionally. I was almost always hung over from the night before, and felt terrible—both because of the hangover, and because it was a reminder of how hopelessly far I had fallen. If Jesus was perfect and yet was crucified, what kind of punishment did I deserve?  \n\n#### **Died for Nothing?**\n  \nBut there was that question again. Why did Jesus die?  \n  \nI mean, as God, He had the power to stop it. The crucifixion wasn’t a surprise to Him; it was all part of the plan. But what was the point of the plan? If our role is just to “be good,” what does His death have to do with anything?  \n  \nAnd again, He was perfect. Jesus went through six legal trials in one night, with people willing to say or do anything to get Him convicted, and yet still the judges [couldn’t even find a reason to charge Him with anything](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+23%3A13-15&version=NIV). And they _still_ sentenced Him to death, knowing He was innocent. That just doesn’t happen. People officially declared to be innocent don’t die torturous deaths at the hand of government for no reason. The very fact that Jesus was killed seems to be a supernatural event. It was part of God’s plan.  \n\n#### **What’s Good About Friday**\n  \nThough it had probably been explained to me before, I never quite got it until I was in church, hung over, and feeling at the end of my rope, knowing there was absolutely no way I could be good on my own. And a man I didn’t really know explained to me the Good News. Which I’ll share with you now, in writing, because it is the most important message in history and I want to tell it to as many people as possible.  \n  \nFirst, the stories about Jesus are true. He was the Son of God, He did do all those miracles to prove it, He did die on a cross, and He did come back to life to prove His power over death. The people who knew Him, saw all these things, told others and wrote them down for us—they all died because they saw it and knew it was true (except for one, who was exiled). They were given the choice to either be quiet about it or be executed, and they chose execution.  \n  \nWhat they knew was that there was _no possible way_ to be “good enough.” Jesus had spent a lot of His time explaining how even those who seemed to do everything right—the rule-following Pharisees, for instance—were still not perfect. Nobody is perfect. And yet [perfection is the standard a perfect God requires](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5%3A48&version=NIV).  \n  \nThe punishment for sin against a perfect God is not penance or prayers, but death and [eternal punishment](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A46&version=NIV). It had been that way from the start, where animals were sacrificed as a picture of the death produced by sin. That was especially the case with the annual Passover sacrifice—the very festival being celebrated when Jesus was killed. The sacrifices showed that something or someone else could take on the punishment each person deserved.  \n  \nAnd that’s why Jesus died: He was the perfect sacrifice. Since He had done nothing wrong, He wasn’t due the punishment of death. But He took on that punishment in our place. Only an eternal, infinite God could take on an eternal punishment for everyone, so that’s what He did. Because God is love, and there’s [nothing more loving you can do than willingly dying to save someone else](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+15%3A13&version=NIV).  \n  \nAnd when Jesus came back to life, it proved He had power over death, and showed what happens to all whom He saves: we may die on earth, but we are given eternal life through Jesus.  \n  \n_For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. –_ [_John 3:16-18_](http://bib.ly/Jn3.16-18.NIV)  \n  \nSo it’s not about being good enough. You can never be good enough. If you think you can be good enough, then you are trusting in yourself—not in Jesus. That’s the danger with religion, and that’s why I would say today that I am not “religious”—I’m a hopeless sinner who is saved from myself by the miracle of Easter.  \n  \nIf God can change me—a great Pharisee _and_ a great sinner—He can change anyone. Do you believe God can change you? How has He changed you?  \n  \n– JP  \n  \nAdditional Resources  \n[Why the Resurrection Matters](http://www.theporchdallas.com/resurrection/)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"5sWgU2ukpiaCAMmE2cWqQg"}}},"url":{"en-US":"good-friday"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/good-friday/"}}},

If you were born between 1980 and 2000 and you belong to a church, you are what’s called an anomaly. I was born in 1980, so I am on the fringe of being a Millennial, but I get your generation. I understand how you tick, what your problems are, why you love the church, and why you hate it. After trusting Christ at the age of 22, I’ve spent the last decade ministering to Millennials, primarily through the weekly gathering of The Porch.  \n  \nThere are [all kinds of statistics](http://theporch.wpengine.com/generation-why-statistics/) on this elusive group, Christian Millennials. I’ve read stats on how they are leaving the church, returning to the church, wanting liturgy in church, wanting concerts in church, and not—under any circumstance—wanting concerts in church. There are a few “experts” on this group, but I’m never sure where they get their information. Over the past seven years, I’ve watched God grow a weekly gathering of 100 Millennials to more than 3,500. While much of this is Him just showing off, there are a few best practices I’ve noticed that might be a resource for His church. I’ve condensed these practices down to a list of seven things to consider when reaching Millennials.\n\n  \n- **Be real**. I mean, be you. Be honest with your imperfections. I recently spoke at a seminary about reaching Millennials, and when I shared this point, it was met with much pushback. People asked, “how can we influence people if they know our sin struggles?” This made me really sad. I’d discourage anyone who is asking this question from ministering to others, at least until you can see that authenticity is actually an advantage in ministry. The world does not need any more inauthentic pastors. If you want them to think that you are the expert and you have it all together, you are actually unqualified for the job. If, however, you are willing to let them know how you struggle, when you struggle, and that you are a quite literally a mess—that’s the first step. Jesus takes your mess and makes it a message, or even a ministry.\n  \n- **Teach the whole truth**. The church has confused people. [Is homosexuality a sin?](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/message/3066) If so, how do we treat sinners? What about [sex before marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/)? What about masturbation? Can I travel with my girlfriend if we don’t have sex? They are asking lots of questions, but primarily they are asking, “Does the Bible address the issues in my life? Can it be trusted?” Millennials don’t want your opinion, and they don’t care much about how you feel. If an issue is addressed clearly in the Bible, tell them so. If an issue isn’t as clear, help them understand how God’s wisdom can be applied in the situation. Tell them what God thinks, and make sure you point them to the Bible, which is how we know what God thinks.\n  \n- **Hold traditions loosely.** Your church is marked by things that inform your unique culture. Many of these things probably aren’t biblical. That doesn’t mean they are wrong; they just aren’t mandated by Scripture. Things like whether you sing traditional hymns or have more modern praise and worship. Do you take communion weekly or monthly? Do you pass a plate? Do a “meet and greet”? Have announcements? If you have strong feelings about any of these things, you may need to stop having strong feelings about them. Change anything you need to change that is not mandated by the Bible, but don’t change anything that is. The areas needing change tend to be blind spots, and you will need help seeing them.\n  \n- **Under-promise and over-deliver.** Millennials are tired of being sold. The church has promised to solve all their problems, heal their wounds, and make them happy. When they walk in, they are usually pretty underwhelmed by smoke machines, by inauthentic greetings, or by unfriendly people claiming to have the “joy of the Lord.” Early on, we’d beg people to come to The Porch. We spent all our money on getting them there. We stopped that and began to use all our resources to make the evening excellent in every way. If only two people showed up, those two would be back next week with two more friends. Excellence honors God and inspires people.\n  \n- **Find leaders.** You will be able to tell who the leaders are: they’ll have a trail of followers behind them. If these leaders love Jesus, they will make great partners in ministry. If they don’t love Jesus, disciple them. These are guys and girls that corporate America is exploiting. They are being sold the American Dream in exchange for their souls—and that’s a bad trade. So, offer them a better one. Show them how their ability to influence others was given to them by God, for God. I’ve been told time and time again by people who are deployed in this way, “I’ve never felt so alive.” I always respond, “that’s because for the first time you are living as you were intended to.”\n  \n- **Call people to greatness.** If you are having to beg people to serve as greeters and ushers, I know why. No one wants to be just a greeter or an usher. Early on at The Porch, we let all of our greeters and ushers go, and recruited evangelists and pastors (many were the same people, but with a new mindset). We called our volunteers to know the Bible and to be able to counsel their peers in situations like abortion, eating disorders, pornography, suicidal thoughts, and other struggles. We helped them realize they are a part of a royal priesthood. We called our volunteers to sobriety and purity. Before raising the bar, we were begging people to serve with us. Now that we actually call them to be and make disciples, they are lining up to serve faster than we can place them on a team.\n  \n- **Give the ministry away.** Once you have qualified people serving with you, let them do the fun stuff. In Exodus 18:13-27 Moses’ father-in-law rebukes him for trying to minister to everyone himself, and encourages him to set up a structure of leadership under him. If you are in ministry, you probably struggle with control. It’s a good time to grow through that. Always take someone with you to meetings, and let them respond to the situations in front of you. Make sure your leaders [know what success looks like](http://theporch.wpengine.com/measuring-ministry-success/), and ask them if there is anything they need to achieve it. Trust them with a budget, or whatever they need to lead their people. Some of the most gifted “pastors” I know serve as volunteers in our ministry and have secular full-time jobs.\n  \n  \nRead everything above again and replace “Millennials\" with “everyone”. Millennials aren’t that hard to reach, and if you’re not reaching them, there might be a good reason. My heart is to help you identify that reason. You might be holding onto traditions too tightly, or you might be striking a miserable deal with your congregation: “show up, pay up, and I won’t call you to do much.” Jesus’ call to his followers was to [come and die](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+9%3A23&version=NIV). If you’re not reaching Millennials, your church is dying. You don’t need tricks and tactics; you need to be the church by calling everyone you minister to, to be the church.  \n  \nMy conclusion is that Millennials are leaving the church for the same reasons that so many people from other generations are leaving the church. Don’t lose heart, though; Christ always wins! You can be a part of that victory by calling those you lead to serve Him with all of their lives.  \n  \nIf this post has prompted more questions, I invite you to join us in April for the [Church Leaders Conference](http://churchleadersconference.com/) to learn from like-minded church leaders about reaching Millennials and other church leadership best practices.  \n  \nIf you are a Millennial, how is the church doing at reaching you? What are other things that the church should be doing to reach Millennials?  \n  \n- JP"},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-reach-millennials"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-reach-millennials/"}}},

What’s the point of being a member?\" You may not have ever consciously asked that question, but you’re definitely answering it by whether or not you choose to join a local church. If you’re a young adult and are not a committed church member, you’re not alone—Millennials are notoriously disconnected consumers in this area. Well actually, you ARE alone, and in a way that really matters, since you’re missing out on one of God’s greatest gifts to you.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/3885) we talked about how important it is to connect deeply with the body of Christ by joining a local church. While there isn’t a verse that says “you must join a church” in those exact words, the Bible has a lot to say about being in committed relationships with other Christians. So, why should you join a church?\n\n#### **1. To surround yourself with God’s people**\n  \nChristianity is a team sport. One of the most commonly repeated themes in the New Testament is “one another.” There are 50+ verses that talk about how Christians should relate to, honor, love, and care for each other. Our faith is not one that’s lived out in isolation; it’s expressed in how we [love God and love others](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+22%3A37-39&version=NIV). You don’t need to be a church member to love people, but it gives you a great place to live out the “one another’s” [in community](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/community).  \n  \nTake a look at Hebrews 10:23-25. You’ll see a lot of “we”, “us”, “one another”, and “together”, and not a single “I” or “me”. The focus of this passage and others like it is that we should hold tightly to unity and not give up on meeting together with other Christians. Does that sound like church-hopping, church-shopping, or only podcasting or live-streaming from your couch?  \n  \nYou want to be really careful in who you surround yourself with. You need to [choose your friends carefully](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+12%3A26&version=NIV), because the wrong ones will lead you astray. [Spend time with wise people](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+13%3A20&version=NIV), because harm is coming your way if you spend it with fools. Surround yourself with God’s people by joining a church that puts a priority on living in authentic biblical community.  \n\n#### **2. To submit yourself to godly leadership**\n  \nWe’re all led by somebody—who are you following? God has set up the local church as the place where every Christian should be able to follow godly leaders. Hebrews 13:17, which is written to a local church, tells them to obey their leaders and submit to them, because the leaders are accountable for keeping watch over their souls. Being a part of a local church defines which leaders you need to be listening to, and which ones are watching over you.  \n  \nIf someone is keeping watch over your soul, wouldn’t you want them to do a good job? Acts 20:28 tells church elders to pay careful attention to themselves and to those God has entrusted to their care. [The role of an elder](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+3%3A1-13&version=NIV) is no small thing, and you want to be under the leadership of people who take it seriously. Submit yourself to godly leadership by joining a church whose elders are committed to knowing and following God’s Word.  \n\n#### **3. To serve God’s mission**\n  \nDid you know that you are uniquely gifted to serve God and other people? Romans 12:4-8 tells us that each member of the body of Christ has gifts that they should fully deploy. Verse 5 makes a powerful point that each member belongs to all the others. This means that your gifts aren’t just yours to do whatever you want with; they were given to you to play a role within the body of Christ. Whatever your gifts are, you should use them [to faithfully serve others](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+4%3A10&version=NIV).  \n  \nUsing your gifts in the church doesn’t mean that the only serving that counts is what you do on Sundays. What it does mean is that you should go all in to make your gifts available to the local church, both to [serve the body of Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+6%3A10&version=NIV) and to be [ambassadors for Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A18-20&version=NIV) to those who don’t know Him. Be on God’s mission by joining a church that’s committed to serving one another and seeking the lost.  \n\n#### **Taking the Next Step**\n  \nIf you attend Watermark but have never joined, you can check out our [membership class](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/connect/membership-class). It happens every month or two, and is a great way to learn more about the church and take a step toward joining. You don’t become a member just by going to the class, but it’s the first part of the process and you’ll hear how you can get fully plugged in.  \n  \nIf you go to another church, find out what their membership process is, and go through it. It may not be as formal as going to a class or signing a membership covenant, but the important thing is that you express, live out, and hold to a commitment to that local church in all the ways God calls you to.  \n  \nWant to connect to the greatest movement the world has ever seen? Join a church.  \n\n#### **Some questions to think about:**\n  \n\n  \n- _If you are a member:_ What were your reasons for becoming a church member? What value do you see in being a member of a local church? What Scriptures informed your decision?\n  \n- _If you are not a member:_ Have you considered local church membership? What’s holding you back from committing to and joining a church? What Scriptures are informing your decision?\n  \n- _For everyone:_ What should you do in response to the call to church membership? What can you do yourself? What can you encourage others to do?\n  \n"},"url":{"en-US":"3-reasons-you-should-join-a-local-church"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/3-reasons-you-should-join-a-local-church/"}}},

Christ is the only [cure for discontentment](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+3%3A7-9&version=NIV).  \n  \nSo how can you be wise with your money as a young adult (or at any age)? The Bible lays out principles and perspectives on money that will help you handle your finances in a way that honors God and frees you from being foolish with money or worried about it.\n\n#### **Trust God with your money and possessions**\n  \nNews flash: you don’t actually own anything. [It all belongs to God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+24%3A1&version=NIV). That means that it’s not your money, it’s God’s money, and you just take care of it for Him. You are a steward, which is someone who manages resources that belong to someone else, and does it according to the owner’s vision and values. Think you earned your money, so it should belong to you? God is the one who [gave you the ability to earn it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+8%3A18&version=NIV), so you can’t claim that either.  \n  \nYour main job as a steward is to know and [love the Owner](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+22%3A36-38&version=NIV), and to be faithful with how you manage His resources. And since the sovereign God of the universe controls all the resources in the world, and [knows exactly what you need](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+6%3A25-34&version=NIV), it means that you can trust Him with your money and possessions, and [not worry](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+6%3A33-34&version=NIV) about them. Wise money management starts with a heart that [trusts God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+3%3A5-6&version=NIV).  \n\n#### **Gather facts and keep them updated**\n  \nThere are three main financial facts that you need to gather and maintain in order to manage your money wisely:  \n\n  \n1. What you OWN\n  \n2. What you OWE\n  \n3. Where your money GOES\n  \n  \nThat means you need to [build a budget](http://cms-cloud.watermark.org/Sample-Budget-Week-2.xlsx?mtime=20150706140354) and spending plan that [honor God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+3%3A9&version=NIV), and then track your expenses vs. that plan. Talk about #adulting! Doing this will allow you to give every dollar a job and control your money, instead of finding out that your money is out of control and you need another job to pay for everything. And you can’t just do it once and then forget about it; you’ll need to keep this updated all the time. Yup, it’s called “responsibility”.  \n\n#### **Live with generosity as a high value**\n  \nGenerosity is a heart issue too, just like stewardship. For many people, being generous is an unplanned afterthought, which makes their giving sporadic, spontaneous, and sparing. But the point of managing money well isn’t just to get better at spending money on ourselves; it’s also to help provide for the needs of others. The Bible calls us to be generous and [cheerful givers](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+9%3A7&version=NIV), and this is a really big deal, because according to Jesus, [where your treasure is, your heart is too](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+12%3A33-34&version=NIV). Make a plan for how you’ll be a generous giver.  \n\n#### **Wisely prepare for the future**\n  \nAs you look to the future, you should be thinking about getting out of debt and saving wisely.  \n  \nThe Bible doesn’t forbid debt, but it does [compare borrowers to slaves](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+22%3A7&version=NIV), and tells you to [work hard to free yourself](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+6%3A1-5&version=NIV) from financial commitments that may have trapped you. Hint: this means [paying them back](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+6%3A1-5&version=NIV). To do this well, you’ll need to put together a [plan to pay down your debt](http://cms-cloud.watermark.org/Most-Awesomest-Spreadsheet.xls?mtime=20150706140324).  \n  \nSaving money means setting it aside for the future; it does NOT mean buying something that is on sale. [More than half of Millennials](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/more-than-half-of-millennials-have-less-than-1000-2015-12-14) have less than $1,000 in savings. So we’ve got some work to do. The Bible says that[wise people store up for the future](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+21%3A20&version=NIV), but it also warns against saving money out of a [desire to get rich](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+6%3A9&version=NIV). You’re not supposed to turn into a hoarder, but it is wise to consider future needs today.  \n\n#### **Need help with your money?**\n  \nThese points were adapted from Watermark’s [Moneywise ministry](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/moneywise), which offers classes and resources to help you to develop solid money management skills and to have an eternal perspective about money and resources. You can check out [this webpage](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/moneywise) to see when the next class is, and also [download resources](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/moneywise/resources) to help you start managing your money wisely right now, like creating a budget and putting together a plan to pay down debt. You can also listen to [many other messages](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/search-results/#stq=money) that we’ve given about money.  \n  \nDon’t let your money or debt own you. Apply the wise principles of managing money that are found in the Bible, and experience the freedom that comes from following God’s plan!  \n  \nHow are you doing with your money?"},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-be-wise-with-your-money"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-be-wise-with-your-money/"}}},

Junk. History. Pain. Hurts. Sin. A PAST—we’ve all got one, since [we've all messed up.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+3%3A10&version=NIV) If you don’t handle it well, your past can define you and negatively impact a lot of your relationships. But it doesn’t have to.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/3926) we talked about God’s answers to seven pieces of bad relationship advice that the world has given us. One of the pieces of bad advice that resonated with many was “Your past defines you.” God’s answer to that bad advice is that your past does NOT define you, and while God does not condone your past sin, [He does not condemn it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A1&version=NIV) if you are a follower of Jesus Christ.  \n  \nSo how should you handle your past? What does God tell you to do with it, and how does He tell you to view it? The Bible has the answers.\n\n#### **Repent from Your Past**\n  \nEveryone’s past [involves sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+3%3A23&version=NIV). It’s part of the human condition, and you can’t escape it. But the beauty of [the gospel](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-gospel/) is that God offers you a full pardon for your sin when you repent from it and [trust in Christ’s death and resurrection](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+10%3A9-10&version=NIV). This means first admitting to God that you have sinned against Him (this is confession – see Psalm 51:4), and then turning from your sin and turning to God (this is repentance – see Acts 3:19). Anyone who has done that becomes a new creation whose past does not define them (2 Corinthians 5:17). The old has gone, and the new has come!  \n  \nWhen you confess your sins, repent from them, and trust Christ, all of your past, present, and future sins are no longer held against you (2 Corinthians 5:19). But that [doesn’t mean you should keep on sinning](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A1-14&version=NIV)! If, after becoming a Christian, you turn your back on God and sin against him, creating even more of a “past” for yourself, the answer is still the same: humbly repent. God will [forgive you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+1%3A9&version=NIV) and welcome you back, like the loving father in the [story of the prodigal son](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+15%3A11-24&version=NIV) (for more on that, listen to [this message](http://www.watermark.org/message/3164) and [this message](http://www.watermark.org/message/3166)).  \n\n#### **Learn from Your Past**\n  \nYou’ve made painful mistakes in your past, and you can – and should – learn something from them. You don’t want to repeat those foolish things, since that would be like a dog returning to its vomit (Proverbs 26:11). Instead, you should:  \n\n  \n- Spend more time reading and memorizing Scripture, which tells you how to live. Psalm 119:71 says that pain can actually be a good thing, because it can teach you to pay closer attention to God’s Word. The Bible will guide your steps if you let it (Psalm 119:105).\n  \n- Behave differently in the future. Proverbs 22:3 says that a wise person sees danger and runs from it, but a fool keeps going and suffers the consequences. Don’t keep doing the things that gave you a painful past to begin with, since you already know that they will lead to consequences. Instead, seek to walk by the Spirit (Galatians 5:13-26).\n  \n- Stay humble. Proverbs 11:2 says that being prideful will lead you to disgrace, but wisdom comes with being humble. If you want to be wise and learn from your past, it starts with an attitude of humility.\n  \n  \n\n#### **Move on from Your Past**\n  \nYou don’t have to keep living in your past! The amazing thing about God’s complete forgiveness of your past sin is that you get to GET UP and MOVE ON from it (Proverbs 24:16). Once you’ve repented, don’t wallow in your past. Don’t dwell on it (Isaiah 43:18). Don’t be miserable about it. God has removed that sin from you (Psalm 103:12), and it’s no longer your identity. Do what the Apostle Paul did: forget what’s behind, and press on toward what’s ahead (Philippians 3:13-14).  \n\n#### **Share about Your Past**\n  \nMoving on from your past doesn’t mean that you should keep quiet about it. Just the opposite actually! God wants you to tell other people about how He has redeemed you (Psalm 107:2). He wants you to tell other people how much He has done for you (Luke 8:39). And He wants you to invite other people to hear your testimony (Psalm 66:16).  \n  \nSharing about your past and God’s provision for your past sin may be the thing that moves someone else to do the same and allows them to experience the incredible freedom that Christ offers. Don’t be shy with your story – share it.  \n  \nWhat are you doing with your past?  \n  \n- Luke  \n\n#### **Additional Resources**\n  \n[When should you share your past](http://theporch.wpengine.com/when-should-i-share-my-past/)  \n  \n[Discussing your sexual past](http://theporch.wpengine.com/discussing-your-sexual-past/)  \n  \n[Regeneration Recovery](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/regeneration-recovery)"},"url":{"en-US":"what-to-do-with-your-past"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-to-do-with-your-past/"}}},

Should you even get involved in politics if Jesus himself isn’t running for office? What’s the best way to be part of America’s imperfect political system? The right answer isn’t abandoning the political process; it’s engaging it in a way that honors God.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/3959) we finished up the Adulting series by talking about standing for righteousness in politics. This is important for anyone to do, but especially our generation. As of 2015, [Millennials are the biggest voting-eligible segment of the U.S. population](http://www.bloombergview.com/interactives/2015-millennials/), which means that we could have the largest role of anyone in influencing our nation’s direction. It’s a responsibility we can’t take lightly. So how would God have us engage politically?\n\n#### **1. Learn God’s perspective on government and the core issues**\n  \nGovernment isn’t the solution to our problems, but it does have a legitimate role to play in our world. It’s not our savior, but it shouldn’t be our sworn enemy either. God has laid out clear responsibilities for governments and citizens – check out Romans 13:1-7, 1 Peter 2:13-17, and Titus 3:1. The government should be just and fair, and citizens are to respectfully submit to its leadership. But where the government oversteps its bounds or becomes corrupt, the Bible also gives guidance on [obeying God rather than man](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+5%3A29&version=NIV), especially when the government tries to stop people from sharing God’s truth.  \n  \nYou also should be locked in on the issues that matter to God and that our government influences. The Bible has something to say about things like [abortion](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/message/3170), [same-sex marriage](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/message/3113), [immigration](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/message/3150), and [economics](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/message/3131). You need to understand God’s perspective and be able to share with with others.  \n  \nNo matter what happens, the right perspective is to keep trusting God. The most important thing to know is that God is still King, and [the government rests on His shoulders](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+9%3A6&version=NIV). He will judge righteously at the time He appoints, and He’s the one who holds things steady when it feels like our world is falling apart (Psalm 75:2–3). Don’t panic; trust God [and pray](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+2%3A1-3&version=NIV).  \n\n#### **2. Engage in diplomacy, not D-Day**\n  \nPeople can be reluctant to talk about politics, since opinions are all over the map and emotions get heated quickly – look no further than Facebook or Twitter, or any of the candidates’ debates. But it shouldn’t feel like an all-out assault when you have these conversations. [We’re ambassadors](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A18-20&version=NIV), not invaders. So here are a few principles to guide you in talking politics.  \n\n  \n- Preserve your witness. Bitterness, anger, brawling, or slander should [have no place in your speech or actions](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4%3A31&version=NIV). Instead, be [peaceful, considerate, and gentle](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=titus+3%3A2&version=NIV). You want people to be left with an [impression of Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+2%3A15-16&version=NIV) when they talk with you, not a bad taste in their mouths.\n  \n- [Speak the truth in love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4%3A15&version=NIV). Don’t shy away from it – [God wants you to teach others what He’s commanded](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A19-20&version=NIV). But you’re not trying to impose your beliefs on anyone; you’re making a divine proposal that there’s a better way to live. Give good reasons for what you believe, but [do it with gentleness and respect](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+3%3A15&version=NIV).\n  \n- Share (and live) the gospel. As Todd said on Tuesday, the way to change a country is to change its citizenry. And the way to change the citizenry is to [proclaim Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+1%3A28&version=NIV) with your life and words in every way. It’s the [power of the gospel](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+1%3A16&version=NIV) that changes lives, hearts, and minds.\n  \n  \n\n#### **3. Take political action**\n  \nNearly [50% of Millennials are not engaged politically at all](http://publicreligion.org/2015/06/millennials-political-slacktivism/#.VuwjnBIrJ0s). Of those who are engaged in some way, many are simply “slacktivists” who might sign an online petition or “like” an issue on Facebook without actually getting involved.  \n  \nSo – vote! We need to fight apathy and take action. Our country’s leaders are not chosen by people who have the RIGHT to vote; they are chosen by people who ACTUALLY vote. You may not have a deep interest in politics, but part of being an adult is being a good citizen – one who has a healthy sense of responsibility to be involved in politics.  \n  \nIn voting, you are delegating your right to rule to someone else, and you shouldn’t be apathetic about that. You need to care deeply about who your rulers are, and you want to know who (or what) rules your ruler. Don’t vote for compromised people without a moral compass. You are never throwing your vote away when you stand for righteousness in voting for a moral leader or for righteousness. Vote for someone who understands the [law of the harvest](https://bible.org/article/seven-laws-harvest), that we will [reap what we sow](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+6%3A8&version=NIV).  \n  \nBeyond voting, ask God how He might use you to fight unrighteousness and [seek the good of the city](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jeremiah+29%3A7&version=NIV) that you live in. He may want you to run for office. Or share the gospel with your neighbor or co-worker. Or [mentor an at-risk child](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/external-focus/ministry-partner-mercy-street). Or [use your weekend to be on mission in your city](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/unashamed). Those may not all feel like political actions, but they are, since they are focusing on the welfare of citizens, which is what being political should be all about.  \n  \nHow are you engaging politically?  \n  \n**Other Resources**  \n[Watermark’s “Declaration” series  \n](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/series/364)[Todd Wagner’s blog](http://wordsfromwags.com/)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"38MqNO3IDCqsMcIqoSUsEY"}}},"url":{"en-US":"how-you-should-engage-politically"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-you-should-engage-politically/"}}},

Being grateful to God for the blessings He’s given, and trusting in God for whatever the future holds. Proverbs 30:7-9 says this, “Two things I ask of you, Lord; do not refuse me before I die: Keep falsehood and lies far from me; give me neither poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread. Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you and say, ‘Who is the Lord?’ Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.”  \n  \nYour daily provision. That’s what you need. Any more, and you run the risk of forgetting God and not looking to Him as the source of all blessing. Any less, and you run the risk of sinning to get what you think you need. Instead of feeling entitled to things and material blessings, praise the God who has [given you every spiritual blessing in Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:3)!  \n  \nMake your list. Pray through it. And ask God to change your heart to one of gratitude. And we’d love to hear what God does!  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1nhpppUfGwK0CAwO0oOG2E"}}},"url":{"en-US":"entitlement-what-do-you-think-you-deserve"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/entitlement-what-do-you-think-you-deserve/"}}},

In order to find peace, you gradually pour out the liquid by clearing your mind, calming your body, and releasing yourself from all conscious thinking, leaving yourself with a clean, empty cup. That’s a picture of secular meditation (at least the New Age form of it).  \n  \nNow imagine that there’s a steak cooking on the grill. You can see the golden char, hear the crackling sizzle, and smell the delicious aroma. But just seeing, hearing, or smelling the steak won’t satisfy you – you eat it, tasting the rich flavor with your mouth and feeling the satisfaction and strength that a feast brings to your body. That’s a picture of Christian meditation. Which sounds better? And more importantly, which one does God want you to do?  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/3976), JP made the point that you need to designate a driver for your life – either your flesh, or the Holy Spirit. If you want the Holy Spirit to be in control of your life, meditating on and applying Biblical truths is how you help that happen.  \n\n#### **What is Christian Meditation?**\n  \nIf the word “meditation” feels like something only for Buddhist monks or hippies or yoga instructors, we need to redefine it, since it’s a spiritual discipline that is both commanded by God and modeled by godly people in Scripture. I like the definition that Donald S. Whitney gives in his book _Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life:_  \n  \n“Meditation [is] deep thinking on the truths and spiritual realities revealed in Scripture…for the purposes of understanding, application, and prayer.”  \n  \nHe makes the point that meditation is a constructive mental activity that fills the mind with God and His truth. It’s the deep absorption of Scripture, not just the intake. To go back to the cup thing, he gives the analogy of your mind as a cup of hot water, and your intake of Scripture as a tea bag. Hearing God’s Word is like dipping the bag once in the water. It’s still not tea. Reading, studying, and memorizing God’s Word is like dipping the tea bag multiple times. Getting better, but probably still weak tea. But meditating on God’s Word is like immersing the tea bag and letting all the rich flavor and color change the water completely. When we meditate on Scripture, it completely colors our thinking about God, His ways, and ourselves.  \n\n#### **God Wants Us to Meditate**\n  \nThe Bible has many verses that instruct us to meditate deeply on God’s Word and truth:  \n\n  \n- In Joshua 1:8 **,** God commands Joshua to always keep the Book of the Law (Scripture) on his lips, meditating on it day and night, and carefully doing everything written in it.\n  \n- Philippians 4:8 tells us to dwell on whatever is true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, or praiseworthy.\n  \n- Romans 12:2 commands us not to conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of our minds.\n  \n- Proverbs 22:17-18 encourages us to pay attention to wisdom and to apply our hearts to Scripture.\n  \n  \n\n#### **Meditation Has Benefits**\n  \nMeditation isn’t just a command from God; He also promises blessing with it:  \n\n  \n- Psalm 1:1-3 – “Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither— whatever they do prospers.\n  \n- James 1:25 – “But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.”\n  \n- Isaiah 26:3 – “[God] will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in [him].”\n  \n  \n\n#### **Some Practical Ways to Meditate on God’s Truth**\n  \nHere are some ideas to start off your meditation on God’s Word. Try these out, experiment with others, and process it with your community. Share with each other what God in your heart and life as you meditate on His truth!  \n\n  \n- **Emphasize each different word** in the text that you’re reading. Think about what comes to mind as you focus on each one. (example: For GOD so loved the world…For God SO loved the world…For God so LOVED the world, etc.)\n  \n- **Rewrite the verse** in your own words, while preserving the core meaning or truth of the verse.\n  \n- **Summarize the truth** that the verses are teaching – pull out the timeless principles.\n  \n- **Pray through the verses** that you’re reading. Speak the verses as your own prayer to God, asking Him to illuminate them for you.\n  \n- **Look for ways to apply** the verses to your own life. As James 1:22 says, taking in God’s Word without actually doing what it says is just deceiving yourself. Put it into action!\n  \n  \nAre you meditating on God’s Word? We’d love to hear how it’s impacting your life!  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1mZSjbUXIw84E2QKWSiSYQ"}}},"url":{"en-US":"dont-empty-your-mind-fill-it"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/dont-empty-your-mind-fill-it/"}}},

It’s so hopeful that it can actually come across as trite and cliché when offered to someone who is suffering. The hope in this verse, however, is a deep well of truth that’s anything but cliché. When we dig deeper into it, we find it to be an even greater source of riches than we could even imagine. Let’s take it one step at a time.\n\n#### **And we know** …\n  \nThe truth of this verse is matter-of-fact for the Christ-follower. It is something we know, like gravity. It is a reality that we exist in and cannot deny since we practice it. Like we know that the sky is blue and grass is green, we know the truth that is to follow.  \n\n#### **…that in all things God works…**\n  \nThis incredible truth starts with God being at work in all things. He is the One who [spoke creation into existence](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+33%3A9&version=NIV), [formed you in your mother’s womb](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+139%3A13&version=NIV), and has [numbered the hairs on your head](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+12%3A7&version=NIV) as well as [the days of your life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+139%3A16&version=NIV). This God has not left you here to flail helplessly through life. He is at work in your circumstances and situations. His hand has not left the steering wheel of your life. If it’s bumpy, rest assured that He’s been here and has navigated these rough roads countless times. He will see you through it.  \n\n#### **…for the good…**\n  \nGod is not laboring in vain. He is not digging a hole only to fill it up again. He is not moving things around only to put them back, over and over again. He is intentionally working toward an end goal. God is accomplishing something that will be good for you. Remember, you can know this. You can be certain that Creator God is at work in your every situation, to bring about something good for you.  \n\n#### **…of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.**\n  \nSo far, we’ve assumed that this promise is for you, but it may not be. This promise is not available to everyone. This promise is reserved for [God’s children](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+3%3A1&version=NIV) – those who love God, and those who have been awakened to the reality that God has a purpose and they are a part of it. Does that describe you? Do you acknowledge that God is using you for His purpose and that His [plans are bigger, and much more important than yours](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+55%3A8-9&version=NIV)?  \n  \nFor those who love God and have been called to His purpose, He is working out something good for them, in everything they are a part of. This is not just a trite “everything happens for a reason.” There’s no hope in that statement. People steal because they want something – that’s the reason they take something from you. They wanted it. But them having a reason doesn’t make it good. Romans 8:28 says that God will use someone stealing from you to bring about something good for you. While that’s hopeful, the real hope comes from understanding what this \"good\" is.  \n\n#### **What is Good?**\n  \nThe good is described in verses 29 and 30. The good is that God’s children will be glorified, like Jesus, [as His brothers and sisters](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+2%3A11&version=NIV), for eternity. In the same way that God has forgiven your sins, He has prepared an eternal blessing for you that you are enduring towards. [There is a reward](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A23-24&version=NIV) at the end of your faithful perseverance. People work out to feel better and look better. As they see the benefit of struggling, sweating, and suffering in the gym, they continue to push toward a desired end goal. If they don’t see the results they desired, they often give up. If they see the results, they may even become addicted to working out. They can’t get enough of the benefit. God is saying there is an eternal benefit to enduring the suffering in this world.  \n  \nCandidly, at the risk of sounding calloused, your suffering won’t matter 100 years from now, except for how you’ve benefited from it. To sound even crazier, you will be glad that you endured it. You will somehow see that it produced good for you and in you.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4018), a very gifted painter completed a work of art on stage in a matter of minutes. When he was done, everyone looked at it and most people just saw something ugly. Because he was an artist on stage, they probably assumed it should be good, and many even tried to make sense of the shapes. They tried to see good in it. So many Christians do this, with trite responses like “everything happens for a reason.” It’s like they're saying “I’m sure there’s good in this, somehow.” But in reality we only see an ugly circumstance or bad situation.  \n\n#### **Redefining Good**\n  \nI then flipped the painting to reveal a beautiful face of Jesus. It couldn’t be seen earlier, but when I flipped it, people gasped in awe and applauded. The artist had painted a beautiful face of Jesus; it was just upside down. What looked ugly, was actually beautiful. What appeared to be bad was actually good. This is the promise of Romans 8:28. When you get to the other side of glory, you will see that what appeared as bad was actually good. “How can my situation be good?!” “How can this breakup be good?!” “How can you call cancer good?!” I don’t know how it is making you more like Jesus, but I know it is.  \n  \nHow can I know this? Consider this: on the worst day in history, God’s only Son was struck with the worst “cancer.” He was publicly tortured and endured a “breakup” worse than anyone could endure. He suffered unimaginable pain, to the point of death. This all happened on a day that we have the audacity to call “Good Friday.” We can only call it that because we’ve received more good from that event than any other in history. God flipped the painting.  \n  \nSome people had seen the painting trick before, and they felt very different emotions than those who had not. They knew that what was coming would be beautiful. They knew it would work out. They didn’t watch on and feel embarrassed for the artist. They felt the hopeful anticipation of the awe of the crowd. They knew it would all work out for good. This is how Christians go through life. We know it will all work out for our good.  \n  \nThis doesn’t mean that we can’t be sad. It doesn’t mean that we can’t hate the result of sickness, disease, and sadness in this fallen world. [Jesus wept](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+11%3A35&version=NIV) at the grave of His friend Lazarus. We are called to [mourn with those who mourn](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+12%3A15&version=NIV). What Romans 8:28 means is that we can’t lose hope. We know that any trouble we face will produce a good that lasts forever and ever.  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"6mbjkBmjf2kmisKeA6M62q"}}},"url":{"en-US":"if-its-not-good-gods-not-done"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/if-its-not-good-gods-not-done/"}}},

Or maybe just _looking_ like you love to follow God? I’ve been in both places. [My story](http://www.theporchdallas.com/thought-i-had-it-all-together/) is one of being proud of my “Christian resume,” secretly sinning while appearing to be righteous, and then finally confessing my sin and experiencing true freedom and joy. For a long time, I faked it with the best of them. I was a Christian, but mostly just following the rules (and blowing it). And like JP said last [Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/3999), faking it is exhausting.  \n  \nSo how do you not fake following God?\n\n#### **Know God**\n  \nTo really follow God, you have to know Him. Not just know about Him – [even demons do that](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+2%3A19&version=NIV) – but actually have a relationship with Him. Jesus [defined eternal life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+17%3A3&version=NIV) as knowing God. The mind-blowing reality that imperfect humans can know the perfect, holy, and just God of the universe can happen only through [the gospel](http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-gospel/). You, as messed up and broken as you are, can know God.  \n  \nAnd you know what? God _wants_ you to know Him! He says in Jeremiah 9:23-24, “Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the Lord who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the Lord.”  \n  \nGod _delights_ in you knowing Him. And He wants you to [know Him more and more](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+peter+3%3A18&version=NIV).  \n\n#### **Love & Obey God**\n  \nIt’s impossible to really know God and _not_ love Him, because we see how much He loves us. God went first, [loving us before we loved Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+5%3A8&version=NIV). And now as His children, we get to love him [in response to His love for us](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:19), with all of our [heart, soul, mind, and strength](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+10%3A27&version=NIV).  \n  \nIf you know God, you love Him. And if you love God, you obey Him. Obeying God is about having a relationship with Him and [walking by the Spirit](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+5%3A16&version=NIV), not just following His rules. Just trying to follow the rules is exhausting, but loving and obeying God is live-giving. So what’s the connection between loving God and obeying Him?  \n\n  \n- **Obedience is a response to love**. Jesus told His followers in John 14:15, “If you love me, keep my commands.” Loving God should lead to [holy obedience](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+1%3A14-15&version=NIV).\n  \n- **Obedience is a demonstration of love**. 1 John 2:3-5 says, “We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands. Whoever says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. But if anyone obeys his word, love for God is truly made complete in them.” Obeying God is a way to show that we love Him.\n  \n- **Obedience is a definition of love**. 1 John 5:3 says, “In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome.” To love God _is_ to obey Him – it’s the same thing! But the second half of that verse is really important to remember, because God isn’t trying to [burden us with a bunch of rules](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+11%3A46&version=NIV) – He wants us to [find rest in Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A28-30&version=NIV). Obeying God isn’t a burden or a beating, it’s a blessing for our benefit.\n  \n  \n\n#### **Trust God**\n  \nYou won’t follow someone that you don’t deeply trust, at least not for long. If you really understand that Jesus is the [Good Shepherd who laid down His life for you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+10%3A11&version=NIV), you’ll want to trust and follow Him. Jesus said in John 10:27-28, “My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand.”  \n  \nSheep follow their shepherd because they know and trust him. [We're God’s children](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+3%3A1&version=NIV), but He also calls us the [sheep of His pasture](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+100%3A3&version=NIV). Embrace your sheep-ness, and trust your Shepherd to lead and guide you with what’s best for you. If you’re struggling with the idea of being a sheep, spend some time in [Psalm 23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+23&version=NIV) to see how King David felt about it, and pray that God helps you to see it the same way.  \n\n#### **Enjoy God**\n  \nFollowing God should be enjoyable! A good test for if you’re really following God or just faking it is whether or not following God brings you deep joy. This goes back to the beating vs. blessing thing. If you see following God as a beating, you’re doing it wrong! But if you see it as a blessing that brings joy, your heart is likely in the right place.  \n  \nNow I don’t mean that every experience you have while following God has to _feel_ enjoyable. Jesus promised that [we’ll have trouble in this life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+16%3A33&version=NIV). And I also don’t mean that it will always feel good to deny yourself some enjoyable-sounding temptations as you wrestle with your sin nature. [That’s part of being human](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A13&version=NIV). But in the deepest part of who you are, do you [delight in following God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+7%3A22&version=NIV)? Is there enjoyment in your obedience? If there isn’t, spend some time [meditating](http://www.theporchdallas.com/dont-empty-your-mind-fill-it/) on verses like John 10:10, Matthew 13:44, Psalm 16:11, Psalm 37:4-6, and Psalm 34:8-10 – these tell you what God wants following Him to be like. Hint: it’s pretty awesome.  \n  \n  \n  \nDo you feel like you’re missing it in any of these areas? I know I do sometimes. Thankfully, God [helps us follow Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+2%3A13&version=NIV), and He is [gracious to us when we mess up](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+103%3A8-14&version=NIV). If you’ve been faking it, start by [confessing that to God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+1%3A9&version=NIV), and then [to another human being](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+5%3A16&version=NIV).

What makes you think, “I can’t wait until THAT happens,” when all the work and pain and patience you’re putting in now will be totally worth it?  \n  \nAs a kid, maybe it was that summer trip to Disneyland, or Christmas morning. As a college student, maybe it was finally being done with studying and getting a real job that paid real money. As a young adult, maybe it’s getting married (or just finding a date), or paying off debt, or getting a six-pack, or traveling the world, or getting that promotion at work. Whatever your answer is, I’m guessing that “sitting in a boring church service for ever and ever” didn’t make your list. More on that in a bit.  \n  \nDid the thought, “heaven is the thing I’m most looking forward to” even cross your mind?\n\n#### **Heaven Is Our Hope**\n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4014), we talked about the answer to a really big question – what is wrong with the world? – and unpacked how the source of our greatest hope is the resurrection. And not just the [resurrection of Jesus](http://www.theporchdallas.com/resurrection/), which has already happened, but the coming resurrection of all who have trusted Christ, and the [restoration of all creation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A20-21&version=NIV). That’s what heaven ultimately is. It will be the best thing to ever happen, and will make any suffering on earth [not even worth talking about in comparison](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A18&version=NIV). It’s the hope that keeps us going [while we wait](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A19&version=NIV), even when life on earth is really hard.  \n  \nBut what do you think heaven will be like? Are you excited about it? Does it make your waiting worth it? Or do you think it’s going to feel like a boring church service that never ends, or maybe a cloud-filled place with a lot of pastels and plenty of time to work on your harp skills? That doesn’t sound like something to look forward to. Thankfully, that’s not heaven.  \n\n#### **What Will Heaven Be Like? Or Not Be Like?**\n  \nOne of my favorite books I’ve read in the past year is _Heaven_ by Randy Alcorn. He basically takes everything that the Bible says about heaven and puts it into one place, laying out how God describes heaven in an easy-to-understand way. It. Is. Going. To. Be. Amazing. Trust me. Or really, trust God.  \n  \nThe book talks about four of the most common misunderstandings about heaven that can keep people from getting excited about it while they’re on earth. All of these are thoughts that I’ve had myself at one point in time, and it’s good to dispel the myths with truth.  \n  \n_Common misunderstandings of heaven:_  \n\n  \n- _Myth: The present heaven, where Christians go when they die now, is the same place we will live forever_. The truth is that Christians who have died are currently [in heaven with Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+23%3A43&version=NIV), but they are looking forward to [Christ’s return to earth](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+thessalonians+4%3A15-5%3A4&version=NIV), the[physical resurrection](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+15%3A35-55&version=NIV) of all Christians, and the [creation of the new heavens and new earth](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+21%3A1-5&version=NIV) where we will live forever.\n  \n- _Myth_: _Physical things are inherently bad, and God’s plan is to bring our spirits to heaven to live without bodies._ The truth is that God originally created the physical world and [called it very good](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1%3A31&version=NIV), and He has never given up His original plan to have perfect human beings rule the physical earth for His glory. The new earth will be perfect, with [no more pain or suffering](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+65%3A17-19&version=NIV). Our physical bodies [will be transformed](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+3%3A20-21&version=NIV) to be like Jesus’ glorified (physical) body.\n  \n- _Myth_: _There will be nothing to do in heaven, and it will be boring, predictable, and without adventure, discovery, or progress._ The truth is that it has nothing to do with clouds and harps, and everything to do with an eternity of exciting learning and [discovery and enjoyment of God and His new creation](http://www.epm.org/static/uploads/downloads/Biola_WhatWeAssumeAboutHeaven_handout.pdf).\n  \n- _Myth_: _We’ll be somehow absorbed into God and lose our individual identities._ The truth is that in the resurrection we’ll keep our current identities and be [forever re-established as individuals](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job+19%3A26-27&version=NIV). We’ll be able to recognize our loved ones, and can [anticipate being reunited with them](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+thessalonians+4%3A14-18&version=NIV).\n  \n  \n\n#### **It’s Worth the Wait**\n  \nSo in summary – on the new earth we’ll be a [perfect physical version](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+3%3A20-21&version=NIV) of our real selves, spending time with God [face-to-face](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+22%3A3-5&version=NIV), enjoying and discovering [perfect restored physical creation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+11%3A6-10&version=NIV), with our believing loved ones and the rest of God’s people…[forever](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+7%3A18&version=NIV). Sign me up for that! No matter what happens now, it will be worth it to get to spend the rest of the rest with God.  \n\n#### **Heaven Should Make a Difference in Your Life Now**\n  \nA.W. Tozer said, “When the followers of Jesus Christ lose their interest in heaven they will no longer be happy Christians, and when they are no longer happy Christians they cannot be a powerful force in a sad and sinful world.”  \n  \nAs Christians we should be PUMPED about heaven, and it should make all the difference in how we view our time on earth. It should give us the hope to [endure any kind of suffering](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+4%3A16-18&version=NIV) with joy, and it should give us the drive to share the gospel of [Jesus as the only way to heaven](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14%3A6&version=NIV) with everyone we meet.  \n  \nHow do you view heaven? And how does it impact the way you live?  \n  \n- Luke  \n  \n**Additional Resources**  \n[What does the Bible say about heaven?](http://www.epm.org/resources/2010/Feb/4/what-does-bible-say-about-heaven/)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"3ykw4Qh5S8mQygeCs6gOGg"}}},"url":{"en-US":"what-are-you-waiting-for"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-are-you-waiting-for/"}}},

His job. Their house. His personality. Her popularity. Their income. His strength. Her smile. Their relationship. Whatever it is, someone else has it, but you don’t. Comparing your life to others will steal your joy, but it’s really hard to stop doing it. How can you kill comparison and find contentment?  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4020) we talked about comparison – the game that everybody plays, but nobody ever wins. One of the main points was that you have two choices when it comes to comparison: you can either trust God and His sovereignty, or you can play the comparison game and lose, every time.  \n  \nThe truth is, God doesn’t want you to live a discontented life. He wants you to have life, and have it to the full (John 10:10). The Bible has a lot to say about fighting comparison and finding contentment. Here are seven ideas on how to do it, including common problem areas that make it hard to be content, and the Bible’s response to them. Identify which problem(s) may best describe where you are, and dig into God’s Word on that topic, asking Him to give you His perspective. And process them with your community as well!\n\n#### **1. Put yourself in the proper place**\n  \n_Problem:_ You think about yourself more than anyone else, and your needs are the most important thing in your world. You don’t feel valuable when you compare yourself to others, so you try to elevate yourself to a position of importance.  \n  \n_Scripture’s solution:_   \n\n  \n- **Romans 12:3** says to not think of yourself more highly than you ought to, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment.\n  \n- **1 Corinthians 12:12-27** talks about the body of Christ (which you’re a part of if you’re a Christ-follower), and points out that every part has a valuable role to play. God has put you in exactly the right place, and you shouldn’t crave someone else’s spot or role.\n  \n- **Galatians 5:26** warns us not to envy each other.\n  \n- **Philippians 2:3** commands believers to do nothing out of selfish ambition or conceit, but instead to be humble and value others above ourselves.\n  \n  \n\n#### **2. Don’t pursue what doesn’t satisfy**\n  \n_Problem:_ You [feel entitled](http://www.theporchdallas.com/entitlement-what-do-you-think-you-deserve/) to what you want, and you’re willing to do whatever it takes to get it, thinking that it will satisfy you long-term.   \n  \n_Scripture’s solution:_  \n\n  \n- In **Matthew 6:19-21** Jesus tells us that it’s a bad idea to store up earthly treasures, since they will ultimately lose their value. Focus on things that have eternal value instead, since your heart will be where your treasures are.\n  \n- **Proverbs 23:4-5** says to not wear yourself out to get rich, or trust your own cleverness, since wealth disappears when you least expect it.\n  \n- **1 Timothy 6:17-19** commands those who are rich ([pretty much all of us](http://www.globalrichlist.com/) in the U.S.) not to be arrogant or to put their hope in being rich. Instead, put your hope in God, who provides everything you need.\n  \n- **Exodus 20:17** , one of the Ten Commandments, warns us not to covet anything that belongs to anyone else.\n  \n  \n\n#### **3. Learn to find contentment in Christ**\n  \n_Problem:_ You aren’t content because you aren’t finding your joy and contentment in Christ. Instead, you look for contentment somewhere outside of Jesus, comparing what you have to what you don’t have.  \n  \n_Scripture’s solution:_  \n\n  \n- In **Philippians 4:11-13** , Paul says that the secret to being content in any circumstance, even while being in serious need, is to get your strength and satisfaction from Christ, not stuff. Even Paul had to learn how to do this, and so will you.\n  \n- **Hebrews 13:5** tells you to keep your life free from the love of money and be content with what you have. Why can you do this? Because God will never leave or forsake you.\n  \n- **2 Corinthians 12:10** says that we can be content even in weakness and hardship, because Christ provides strength in our weakness.\n  \n- **1 Timothy 6:6-8** reminds us that we can’t take anything with us when we die, so we should be content with what we have. And if we have godly contentment, we actually have great gain!\n  \n  \n\n#### **4. Thank God in everything, for everything**\n  \n_Problem:_ You don’t express gratitude to God for what He’s given you. Your focus on what you don’t have steals your thankfulness for what you do have.  \n  \n_Scripture’s solution:_  \n\n  \n- **1 Thessalonians 5:18** tells us that God’s will for us is to give thanks in all circumstances.\n  \n- **Ephesians 5:20** encourages us to always give thanks to God for everything, in the name of Jesus.\n  \n- **Philippians 4:4-7** says to rejoice in the Lord always. And even when making requests to God, we should bring them to Him while thanking Him for what He’s already blessed us with.\n  \n- **Psalm 63:4-5** reminds us that praising God and focusing on Him is deeply satisfying.\n  \n  \n\n#### **5. Ask God to give you what you need**\n  \n_Problem:_ You aren’t asking God to give you what you need, or you’re asking Him with the wrong motives for things you don’t really need.  \n  \n_Scripture’s solution:_  \n\n  \n- In **Matthew 6:11** Jesus tells us to ask God to give us our daily bread – what we need to live that day.\n  \n- In **Matthew 7:7-11** Jesus explains that God delights in giving good gifts to His children when they ask Him. He will provide those gifts like a loving father would, knowing what’s best for us.\n  \n- **Proverbs 30:7-9** gives an example of asking God to provide neither riches nor poverty, but only what’s needed each day. Having too much could make you forget God, and having too little might tempt you to turn your back on Him.\n  \n- **James 4:2-3** says that sometimes we don’t have what we need because we haven’t asked God for it. And sometimes we don’t get what we want because we’re asking Him with the wrong motives.\n  \n  \n\n#### **6. Fill your mind with what truly satisfies**\n  \n_Problem:_ You’re filling your mind with things that remind you of what you don’t have, and you’re not spending any time or energy filling your mind with what matters.  \n  \n_Scripture’s solution:_  \n\n  \n- **Philippians 4:8** tells us to spend our time and energy thinking about things that are true, noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, or praiseworthy. Don’t use your thoughts to compare yourself to others or to think about what you don’t have.\n  \n- **Colossians 3:2** reminds you to set your mind on eternal things, not on earthly things.\n  \n- **2 Corinthians 10:5** says to take every sinful thought captive and make it obedient to Christ. If you’re struggling to point your thoughts to Christ, ask Him to help you.\n  \n  \n\n#### **7. Be faithful to what God has called you to**\n  \n_Problem:_ You’ve lost focus on God’s unique calling for your life. Instead, you’ve focused on wanting someone else’s life.  \n  \n_Scripture’s solution:_  \n\n  \n- **Ephesians 2:10** reminds us that we’ve been created in Christ Jesus do to good works that God has prepared in advance for us to do. God wants us to be faithful to live out our purpose!\n  \n- **1 Timothy 6:18-19** tells us to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. By doing this we’ll store up eternal treasures for ourselves and experience true life.\n  \n- **1 Corinthians 7:17** says that each person should lead the life that God has assigned to them and called them to. He doesn’t want you to compare your life to others; He wants you to be faithful in the life that He’s uniquely called you to.\n  \n  \nGod wants to help you live a life of joy, freedom, and contentment! Which of these problem areas do you most need Him to work on in you?  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"7a4ljOEwo0g8YmqM8KayYo"}}},"url":{"en-US":"7-ways-to-kill-comparison-and-be-content"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/7-ways-to-kill-comparison-and-be-content/"}}},

For the next hundred years or so, you and your sons build this massive vessel, working with your hands to create it from scratch. You are _doing something_ to save your family. Once it’s finished, your family and the animals are loaded in, God shuts the door, and then you endure the most cataclysmic event the earth has ever seen, floating in what’s basically a huge wooden box while the world as you know it is destroyed. You can _do nothing_ but wait, pray, and trust God. And once the storms pass, you spend another 300 or so days just floating, waiting for the waters to recede. You can _do nothing_ but wait and pray, trusting that God will direct you to dry land…if any is left.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4086), we talked about Noah and the Flood. One of the main points was how Noah had zero control over his life once he was in the ark; he could only trust God to protect and direct it. How do you think Noah felt after spending close to a century working with his own hands and strength to build the ark, only to have zero control over the outcome once the Flood got started? I’m guessing it didn’t feel great. I wonder if he questioned why God didn’t have him install a rudder or sail on the ark so that he could steer.  \n  \nDo you struggle with wanting to control your life? Do you feel like you’ve put in enough effort and obedience that you deserve for God to hand you the rudder and give you the outcome you want? Well, it doesn’t actually work that way, since God doesn’t make deals like that. But He does love you more than you can imagine, and He wants you to experience the peace and joy that come from trusting in His control instead of your own.  \n  \nLet’s look at some areas of life that many of us want to control, or think that we actually _are_ in control of, and see what the Bible says about them.\n\n#### **How Healthy You Are**\n  \nWho doesn’t want to be healthy? There are some things that it seems we can influence with a lifestyle of eating right, exercising, and getting plenty of sleep. After all, there is [some value from being physically disciplined](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+4%3A8&version=NIV). It’s OK to even [pray for good health](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=3+john+2&version=NIV). But can you really control it? No. There are too many stories of otherwise healthy people getting seriously sick, whether it’s cancer, MS, a heart attack, ALS, or so many other things.  \n  \nGod doesn’t promise that you’ll be healthy your whole life. He may [allow you to get sick so that He’ll be glorified when He heals you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+9%3A1-3&version=NIV). Or He [may be allowing Satan to test you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job+2%3A4-6&version=NIV), to see if you only love God because he’s blessed you with health. Or He may be using sickness to [remind you that you need to rely on Him for strength instead of yourself](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+12%3A7-9&version=NIV). Health isn’t promised, but you can trust that God is in control of your health, and He has a purpose in however healthy you are.  \n\n#### **How Long You Live**\n  \n79 years is about the average American lifespan. Do you think you’ll make it that far? Many of you likely will. Some of you will probably blow by it, maybe even living well into your 90’s. And some of you may not make it past the next five years, or even less. It’s a sobering thought, since as young adults we like to think that we’re invincible and that we’re guaranteed a long life ahead of us. But reality tells us that people die “before their time,” all the time.  \n  \nGod is in control of how long you’re alive, [holding in His hand the breath of all mankind](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job+12%3A10&version=NIV), and [ordaining each of the days of your life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+139%3A16&version=NIV). Knowing this fact will help you [have a heart of wisdom](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+90%3A12&version=NIV). And thankfully, no matter how long your life on earth is, if you’re a Christian you’re guaranteed [eternal life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+5%3A24&version=NIV)! Trust God that He’s given you the right number of days, and [make the most of each day](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5%3A16&version=NIV) as it comes.  \n\n#### **Your Job and How Much Money You Make**\n  \nWhile you’re young, this is the time to put in the work and do whatever it takes to build your career, because then you’ll have made your money and be set for life. Right? At least that’s how the thinking goes. But it’s wrong. Some of you are absolutely giving all of yourselves away to your jobs, because you think that you can control how successful and wealthy you are, and that being successful and wealthy will satisfy you. Neither are actually the case.  \n  \nThe Bible warns you [not to boast of your plans for success and wealth in the future](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+4%3A13-16&version=NIV). Instead, you should submit your career plans fully to the Lord. You shouldn’t wear yourself out to get rich, because [you can’t actually control whether your wealth sticks around](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+23%3A4-5&version=NIV). Wealth is uncertain, so instead of hoping in it, [you should hope in God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+6%3A17&version=NIV), who [controls all the world’s resources](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+24%3A1&version=NIV) and will let you steward them according to His will and purpose. [Work hard at whatever you do](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A23&version=NIV), but do it because you’re serving the Lord, not because you’re trying to get rich or promoted. If you do obtain wealth, remember that [it’s God who gave you the ability to earn it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy+8%3A18&version=NIV), and [look for ways to be faithful](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A14-30&version=NIV) with the resources He’s entrusted to you.  \n\n#### **Your Future**\n  \nMaybe you aren’t trying to control your life so that you’re healthy, rich, and make it to a ripe old age, but you probably have plans and desires of some kind for the future. Whether you’re a super type-A planner or someone who just likes to go with the flow, the Bible reminds you that you’re not ultimately in control. You may plan your course, but [it’s God who directs your steps](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+16%3A9&version=NIV). [His purpose for your life will win out](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+19%3A21&version=NIV), no matter what your plans are. And that’s a good thing, because God’s plan for your life is [to work everything for your good](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A28&version=NIV). It might look different from how you imagined it, but you can trust Him.  \n\n#### **Instead of Controlling…TRUST**\n  \nFor some of you, the truth that you’re not in control freaks you out, since you trust yourself more than you trust anyone or anything else, including God. For others, you may be tempted to just put life on cruise control and not take any responsibility for whatever happens, because “hey, God is in control!” Here’s the right balance: you’re responsible for _[faithful obedience](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+John+1%3A6&version=NIV)_, and God is responsible for the _[outcome](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+55%3A8-11&version=NIV)_.  \n  \nProverbs 3:5-6 summarizes it well: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; **<sup> </sup>** in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.”  \n  \nWhat are you trying to control? What do you need to give over to God’s control?  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"69TMEqBXLakgWeuk26wWOC"}}},"url":{"en-US":"youre-not-actually-in-control"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/youre-not-actually-in-control/"}}},

What if He promised that bad things would happen to you – that life would be hard – would that make you love and trust Him less? It should actually make you love and trust Him more. Why? Let’s go.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4031), JP finished off the Romans 8 series by focusing on God’s love for you. As he put it, God’s love cuts through all accusations, condemnation, and separation to give you good without reservation. Amazing! As the Apostle Paul put it in Romans 8:38-39, nothing can separate you from God’s love for you in Christ…not whatever life brings, not death, not anything that is happening to you or ever will happen to you, not any spiritual force, and not anything in creation. NOTHING can remove you from God’s love! That’s a huge truth – thank God for it, and ask Him to help that soak into your soul.  \n  \nThe problem is, all the stuff in that list of things that can’t separate you from God’s love, can make you really feel like God must not love you! Breakups. Cancer. [Singleness](http://www.theporchdallas.com/gift-of-singleness/). Job loss. Addiction. Sickness. Death. They all happen, either to you or to people you know. And they can cause you to doubt God’s love, unless you realize that His promises to you are so much more than an (out of context) Jeremiah 29:11-style “coffee mug promise” that everything will make you feel prosperous and hopeful.  \n  \nSo what has God actually promised? Here are two promises that you must count on in order to be sure of God’s love for you, and to have peace and joy in the middle of a crazy and jacked-up world.\n\n#### **Promise #1: You Will Have Trouble**\n  \nIn the middle of John 16:33, Jesus tells His disciples, “…in this world you will have trouble.” That’s a summary of a whole list of bad things He said would happen to them, from being hated and persecuted to being murdered. Jesus was being real – hard times were coming.  \n  \nPeter, who heard this straight from Jesus, passed on the same message to Christians in his later letters. In 1 Peter 4:12 he tells believers not to be surprised at the “fiery trials” they are going through, as if something strange was happening to them. He’s basically telling them, “it’s not strange that you have trouble even though you’re a Christian. In fact, you should expect it!” (_And more than expect it –_ [_rejoice in it_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1%3A2-3&version=NIV) _– but that’s another blog post_).  \n  \nAn important part of this first promise is to know WHY hard things happen. It’s not because God doesn’t love you; it’s because [our world is full of sin and death](http://www.watermark.org/message/4014). Jesus is just acknowledging current reality.  \n  \nSo when trouble happens in your life, whatever it is, it shouldn’t make you turn your back on God or think that He doesn’t love you. Instead, remember that _He told you it would happen_. So that promise came true. Let the trouble remind you that you can trust Him and take Him at His word.  \n\n#### **Promise #2: You Can Overcome Trouble Because of Jesus**\n  \nThankfully, Jesus didn’t just stop with a “life’s going to be hard, deal with it” type of promise. In the last part of John 16:33 He tells His disciples that they will have trouble, “But take heart! I have overcome the world.”  \n  \nWhat does that mean? It means that if you are a Christian, your [salvation is won](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+thessalonians+5%3A9&version=NIV), your [sin doesn’t own or define you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A14-18&version=NIV), your [future is secure](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10%3A27-29&version=NIV), and your [faithfulness will be rewarded](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1%3A12&version=NIV). Jesus has overcome every possible consequence of sin and brokenness, and He’s also going to come back to [destroy sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+19%3A11-21&version=NIV) and to [make everything new and right](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+21%3A1-7&version=NIV) in the future.  \n  \nCombine that promise with the awesome truth that [God works everything – even bad things – for your good](http://www.watermark.org/message/4018), and the amazing implication is this – _being a Christian and having God love you doesn’t mean that bad things won’t happen; it means that you can overcome those bad things with God’s strength_, _and God will actually make something good come from it._   \n  \nNothing bad that happens should make you stop loving God. And nothing bad that happens means that He’s stopped loving you. There’s nothing that can make you lose His love if you are in Christ. Take heart.  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"6jvH0imjtKicgWmqwQMeiK"}}},"url":{"en-US":"2-promises-of-god-that-you-must-count-on"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/2-promises-of-god-that-you-must-count-on/"}}},

When Adam & Eve sinned by disobeying God, everything changed for them and [for all of humanity](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+5%3A12&version=NIV). How did they get there, when they were living in paradise and had everything they could ever need? They were tempted, just like you and I are every day. After they were tempted, they sinned, and nothing would ever be the same.  \n  \nI doubt that Satan tempted you today to take a bite of literal forbidden fruit, but you were probably tempted to do something like lust after someone else’s body, covet someone else’s stuff, tell a “little white lie,” cut corners at work, act selfishly, or bring the pain on some fool in traffic. Maybe you even gave in to that temptation. Not good. Sin.  \n  \nLike we talked about [last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4041), Adam and Eve’s choice to sin started with temptation (considering sin) and ended in death. Your choice to sin doesn’t have the cosmic implications that theirs did, but sin still brings death, and fighting and overcoming temptation is incredibly important to your spiritual life and health. So how can you do it? Hint: you can’t do it alone.  \n\n#### **1. Be alert and on guard to temptation**\n  \nIf you know temptation is coming, it’s easier to fight. And trust me, it’s coming. It can come from [inside you, fueled by your own desires](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1%3A13-15&version=NIV), or [from the devil, who’s looking to destroy you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+5%3A8&version=NIV). Satan is a [lying killer](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+8%3A44&version=NIV) and a [schemer](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+2%3A11&version=NIV), and he’ll stop at nothing to [try to lead you away from Jesus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+11%3A3&version=NIV). He’s going to hit you where you’re weak and most likely to give in. Tempted to look at porn while you’re struggling with loneliness? Or to drink or take a hit when you’re bored with life? Or to find happiness in “retail therapy” when you’re battling negative thoughts of comparison? These are not accidents.  \n  \nBeing tempted isn’t sin – [even Jesus was tempted in every way but stayed sinless](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+4%3A15&version=NIV). Temptation is a [common part of being human](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A13&version=NIV). But temptation will lead to sin if you don’t fight it with the tools God has given you. Being aware of temptation is the first step to fighting it.  \n\n#### **2. Find (and fight for!) the way out from temptation**\n  \nThe Bible promises that when you are tempted, God will [provide a way out](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A13&version=NIV) so that you can endure it without sinning. But what does that actually mean? Will your phone suddenly lose power as you go to that website? Or your car not start when you’re about to drive to that guy’s house? Or the lid on that drink be impossible to open? Probably not, since God giving you a way out doesn’t mean that He has to physically prevent you from sinning. Instead, it means that if you’re a Christian, you are no longer a [slave to sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A18&version=NIV), and God has given you the means to choose righteousness and holiness instead of sin. [He gives you the ability to say no](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=titus+2%3A11-13&version=NIV)!  \n  \nJust because there is a way out from temptation, though, doesn’t mean that it’s the easy way out. You’ll have to fight hard for it! And God has given you the [weapons and armor that you’ll need](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+6%3A10-18&version=NIV) – use them. [Knowing and following His Word will keep you on the path of purity](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+119%3A9&version=NIV). Living with other believers in authentic community will help [keep you from being hardened or deceived by sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+3%3A13&version=NIV). And as you pray, the Holy Spirit will help you [remember what Jesus would have you do](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14%3A26&version=NIV). Fight sin, and fight hard. [Make war](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASU6kCbgxfs)! _(trust me – click that link. It will get you pumped!)_  \n\n#### **3. If you gave in to temptation: confess, repent, and re-arm**\n  \nNo matter how hard you fight, since you’re not perfect, you will blow it at some point. That doesn’t mean that you should just throw in the towel and binge on whatever sin you gave in to. Not at all! Your sin is covered by God’s grace, but that [doesn’t mean you should keep on sinning](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A1-4&version=NIV). Instead, God’s grace means you can [approach Him with confidence, knowing that He will help you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+4%3A16&version=NIV). He has [compassion on you as your loving Father](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+103%3A13-14&version=NIV). His desire is to heal you and free you from sin and its effects.  \n  \nWhen you sin, God wants you to confess and repent. Confessing just means humbly admitting all of your sin, [first to God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+1%3A9&version=NIV) and then [to other believers in your life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+5%3A16&version=NIV). Repenting means that [you turn away from your sin and turn to God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+5%3A16&version=NIV), showing [by your actions](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+3%3A8&version=NIV) that you actually want to change. When you are brokenhearted over your sin, it may feel like God is far from you, but He’s actually [never been closer](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+34%3A18&version=NIV).  \n  \nAlso, don’t waste your regret after you sin. You know the feeling – “I NEVER want to do that again!” That feeling is a gift, and you should use it to set up barriers that make it harder for you to access that sin the next time you’re tempted (which you will be). Rebuild your defenses and re-arm your weapons. For example, in your moments of regret after looking at porn, that’s the best time to [do whatever it takes](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-overcome-a-pornography-addiction/) to help you stop.  \n\n#### **4. If you resisted temptation, rejoice but stay humble**\n  \nSometimes you will handle temptation well. Satan will throw something at you, and you’ll dodge it, deflect it, or dominate it with the tools God has given you. Celebrate that you are walking in freedom! But even then, Satan’s got at least one more trick up his sleeve. If you resist temptation, and then think that you deserve all the credit instead of God – boom. Satan got you with the sin of pride. And when you’re prideful, you’re vulnerable, and [God is actually in opposition to your pride](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+4%3A6&version=NIV). [If you think you’re doing great, be careful that you don’t fall](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A12&version=NIV)! [Stay humble](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+3%3A34&version=NIV).  \n\n#### **5. Get ready for the next temptation that’s coming**\n  \nThe hits will keep on coming. As long as you’re alive, you’ll be tempted by sin. It may not always be the same sin, but you can be confident that it will be something. Since you know that danger is coming, [the wise thing would be to prepare for it, instead of thoughtlessly charging ahead and paying the price](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+22%3A3&version=NIV).  \n  \nThe most important thing that you can do to prepare for temptation is to stay connected to Jesus. It’s His power at work in you that gives you the [ability to think and act in a way that honors Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+2%3A13&version=NIV). In His words from John 15:5, “[If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+15%3A5&version=NIV)” The things from step #2 that help you fight temptation when it happens, are the same things that help you get ready before it happens next. Soak in the wisdom of God’s Word. Surround yourself with others who know and love God and who will encourage [and admonish you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A16&version=NIV). And pray for the ability to choose righteousness instead of sin when temptation hits.  \n  \nYou don’t have to bite the apple!  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"4cipk8K9uMmm6Qum64Cqck"}}},"url":{"en-US":"5-steps-to-fight-temptation-and-win"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/5-steps-to-fight-temptation-and-win/"}}},

Maybe you’ve heard us talk about the upcoming launch over the past couple weeks and wondered what it means, or maybe this is the first time you’ve heard anything at all about it. Either way, we’re excited to let you know that The Porch Downtown is happening this summer, hosted at the South Side Ballroom.  \n\n#### **What is The Porch Downtown?**\n  \nThe Porch has always been a movement of young adults looking to change the world. It’s not just a gathering; it’s a mission. Our reasons for expanding downtown are the same as why we meet in North Dallas – so that young adults can connect with others, connect with God, talk about life’s most important questions, and learn to live out the abundant life that God desires for them. The Porch Downtown will provide the same opportunity for young adults in their 20s & 30s to come just as they are, but not leave unchanged. Like The Porch Fort Worth does, we’ll have live worship onsite, then stream the message from the North Dallas campus.  \n\n#### **When and where is The Porch Downtown meeting?**\n  \nThe Porch Downtown will begin on Tuesday, June 7th at 7:30 pm at the South Side Ballroom ([1135 South Lamar Dallas, Texas 75215](https://www.google.com/maps/place/South+Side+Ballroom/@32.7691475,-96.7979541,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x864e990498f83249:0x8adddaff24f56f1e)) and will continue every Tuesday through the end of the summer.  \n\n#### **Why are we launching a new Porch campus?**\n  \nWell, it’s not really “new,” and it’s not really “another” Porch. This is true because the same work that started to influence Dallas through The Porch eleven years ago has now spanned many miles and countries, and has impacted downtown Dallas strongly along the way. For years, many young adults from Downtown and Uptown have fought traffic on Tuesday nights to gather at our main campus. Our research shows that as many as half of the current Porch Dallas attendees live near downtown Dallas. In heading downtown, we haven’t added another Tuesday night Porch; we’ve just added a new section of seats to the existing Porch—only 10 miles further south.  \n\n#### **Who is The Porch Downtown for?**\n  \nThe Porch Downtown will definitely make it easier for some of you to attend the Porch because it's closer to where you live or work. But it shouldn’t stop there! We want to open an opportunity for many people who have never been to The Porch to start coming, whether it’s because they live further south or because they haven’t been interested in coming to a church. We also hope that it becomes easier for you to ask a friend to join you – please invite them!  \n  \nThis prayer has been at the heart of The Porch since the beginning: _“_[_Lord, enable your servants to speak Your Word with great boldness. Stretch out Your hand to save every young adult in Dallas._](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/message/2207)_”_  \n  \nThe Porch Downtown allows us to be in the heart of our city. It will be at the intersection of our ministry partners, the marketplace, and even more Millennials. We also hope that having a new meeting place downtown will free up some space at our main campus for more friends to join us in North Dallas.  \n  \nPorch-goers are of course welcome at any of our gathering spots. Although in the interest of building meaningful relationships and being known and loved by others, we would encourage you to be consistent at whichever location makes the most sense for you.  \n\n#### **In short, we’re starting The Porch Downtown because:**\n  \n\n  \n- There is a strong, consistent desire for it among young adults in the city.\n  \n- There is a trusted group of volunteer servant-leaders who have shown their willingness and ability to carry the weight of the ministry.\n  \n- Most of all, because God desires to reconcile young adults in Downtown to Himself in a loving relationship, and we humbly hope that He would use our efforts to do so.\n  \n  \n\n#### **What can you do?** \n  \nFirst and foremost, please pray that God would be the enabler and accomplisher of The Porch’s ministry in Downtown. The Scriptures say that “unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain” ([Psalm 127:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+127%3A1&version=NIV)). May we never labor in vain in Downtown, North Dallas, or Fort Worth!  \n  \nSecond, please share this news with any young adult you know, but especially those from South Dallas and the rest of the southern corridor to Uptown, from West Dallas / Oak Cliff to East Dallas / Mesquite.  \n  \nThird, you can let us hear from you. You can reach us at [theporch@watemark.org](mailto:theporch@watemark.org), and we’d love to get to know you!  \n  \nLastly, on behalf of the entire faithful and passionate Porch Downtown team, I’d like to extend a very warm, very personal, and very old invitation to you about the Christ who has saved and changed each one of us so incredibly: “Come and see!” ([John 1:46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A46&version=NIV))  \n  \n– Ryan Wall  \n  \n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"76kddRgqjKUqaYqm2okGkw"}}},"url":{"en-US":"the-porch-is-streaming-downtown-this-summer"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-porch-is-streaming-downtown-this-summer/"}}},

One who towered over you, was trained as a warrior from his childhood, wore technologically advanced body armor, had an extra bodyguard, and could run you through with one thrust of his huge spear? I’d be afraid – or at least I would be if I was fighting him alone.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4125), we talked about how David faced that exact situation when [he took on Goliath in a fight for Israel’s freedom](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+samuel+17&version=NIV). Instead of cowering in fear, David relied on God’s power and stepped out in faith. The fight ended pretty quickly, with David launching a rock into the giant’s face and then cutting off Goliath’s head with his own massive sword. Victory, but David knew he didn’t earn it on his own – [God made it happen](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+17%3A45-47&version=NIV).  \n  \nYou may not be facing a literal giant today, but something in your life probably has you scared, or at least uncertain or even worried. Maybe you’re trying to figure out how to get out of a huge amount of debt. Or make ends meet with a paycheck that’s anything but giant. Or tackle that big task your boss assigned but you have no idea how to do. Or maybe you’re battling an illness that wins almost every time. Or maybe you feel like you’ll be fighting alone for the rest of your life, with no partner next to you. Or maybe \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. You fill in the blank – whatever it is, it’s big.  \n  \nSo how are you supposed to handle stuff that’s scary and bigger than you are? Hint: not by yourself.\n\n#### **God doesn’t want you to be afraid**\n  \nDo you know what the most repeated command from God in the Bible is? You might think it’s one of the Ten Commandments, or some other sort of “do not.” And well, you’re sort of right, but it might surprise you. Here it is:  \n  \nDo. Not. Fear.  \n  \nThat’s right – “do not be afraid” (or some variation of that) is one of the most repeated messages in the Bible. God wants you to hear that. But it’s not just a mic drop or an empty statement; there’s almost always a “because” that comes after it. There are really good reasons why we don’t have to be afraid if we have trusted Christ, and that’s what God wants us to understand.  \n  \nThere are more Bible verses on not being afraid than this blog post has room for, but here are 10 that stand out to me:  \n\n  \n- [Isaiah 41:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+41%3A10&version=NIV) – “So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God.  \nI will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.”\n  \n- [Isaiah 43:1b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+43%3A1&version=NIV) – “Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine.”\n  \n- [Psalm 23:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+23%3A4&version=NIV) – “Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.”\n  \n- [Joshua 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joshua+1%3A9&version=NIV) – “Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.”\n  \n- [Psalm 118:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+118%3A6-7&version=NIV) – “The Lord is with me; I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me? The Lord is with me; he is my helper. I look in triumph on my enemies.”\n  \n- [2 Timothy 1:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+timothy+1%3A7&version=NIV) – “For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.”\n  \n- [1 John 4:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+4%3A18&version=NIV) – “There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.”\n  \n- [Proverbs 29:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+29%3A25&version=NIV) – “Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is kept safe.”\n  \n- [Hebrews 2:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+2&version=NIV) – “…[Jesus] too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.”\n  \n- [Psalm 27:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+27%3A1&version=NIV) – “The Lord is my light and my salvation—whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life—of whom shall I be afraid?”\n  \n  \nThere’s a lot of truth in those 10 passages. If you have trusted Christ, you don’t have to be afraid because God loves you perfectly, God is with you always, and God has given you a spirit not of fear but of power, love, and self-discipline.  \n  \nIt’s important to realize that the Bible isn’t saying that you don’t have to be afraid because God is going to fix everything in the way you expect and in the timing you want. Ultimately, [He will make everything new and perfect](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+21%3A5&version=NIV), but while you’re alive you may not be delivered from whatever situation is making you afraid. What delivers you from fear isn’t a change in circumstances, but a change in focus and an exercise of faith, knowing that God loves you and is completely good and completely trustworthy.  \n\n#### **What to do when you’re afraid**\n  \nEven if you keep all of those truths in mind, there are going to be some times when you battle fear. In those moments, here’s what God wants you to do:  \n\n  \n- Trust Him ([Psalm 56:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+56%3A3&version=NIV))\n  \n- Humble yourself before Him ([1 Peter 5:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+5%3A7&version=NIV))\n  \n- Ask Him for help ([Philippians 4:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A6-7&version=NIV))\n  \n- Take strength from Jesus’ example ([Hebrews 12:2-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12%3A2-3&version=NIV))\n  \n- Step out in faith ([Matthew 14:27-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+14%3A27-29&version=NIV))\n  \n- Obey God, no matter the situation ([1 Peter 3:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A14-15&version=NIV))\n  \n  \nGod doesn’t want you to live in fear, and He’s given you the weapons you need to fight fear. Will you use them?  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"4fjrpvh5QsAwYsseEeuiYi"}}},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-fight-fear"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-fight-fear/"}}},

Maybe it’s a tattooed cigarette-smoking motorcyclist, or a Che Guevara-style revolutionary, or (for you Star Wars fans) maybe it’s Luke Skywalker. There are all kinds of rebels.  \n  \nAre you a rebel?  \n  \nThe truth is, everyone is a rebel in some way. The important question is, what kind of rebel are you, and what kind of rebel should you be? You need to be sure of your answer, because it’s one that will decide where you spend eternity, as well as how you live your life today.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4130), we talked about three rebels named Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They [went against what everyone else was doing](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+3%3A16-18&version=NIV), even though it meant near-certain death to defy the King Nebuchadnezzar’s orders. [God saved them from getting roasted](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+3%3A23-27&version=NIV) in a furnace, showing that they were the right kind of rebels.  \n  \nLet’s see what the Bible says about three kinds of rebels.\n\n#### **A Rebel Against God**\n  \nEither you used to be a rebel against God, or you still are. There are no exceptions. If you haven’t trusted Christ, this is you, no matter if you’re a thug or a “good person.” Everyone starts off in this category, and trusting Christ through the message of [the gospel](http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-gospel/) is the only thing that gets you out of it. Romans 3:23 says that everyone has sinned and falls short of God’s glory. Ephesians 2:3 says that by our very nature, we deserve God’s wrath.  \n  \nAmazingly, God is in the business of turning rebels into the reconciled. 2 Corinthians 5:17-20 puts it this way: **_<sup>“</sup>_** _Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! **<sup> </sup>** All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.”_  \n  \nWould you rather be a rebel against God or an ambassador for Him? You’re either one or the other, and the Bible is clear that this is the kind of rebel that you don’t want to be.  \n\n#### **A Rebel Against Earthly Authorities**\n  \nShould you be a rebel against earthly authorities? The answer to this question can be a little tricky, since I might say “sometimes” or “it depends.” Clearly Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar’s authority, so was that a bad thing? We can see from Scripture that it was actually a good thing for them to disobey the king’s evil command, since God saved them and proved their decision to be the right one.  \n  \nSo how should that impact how you respond to authorities in your life? In general, obeying authority seems to be the right thing to do, but even in this you must be discerning. This is a question with real-world implications, since most if not all of us are under some kind of authority, whether it’s a boss, principal, parent, president, pastor, or the police. There are two extremes to avoid here. Some of you are probably super independent and chafe at the idea of other people telling you what to do, and you are more likely to rebel than to obey. “What speed limit? Those are for losers!” For others of you, you may be more likely to do whatever an authority figure tells you to do, even it’s something wrong or potentially compromising to your witness. “Lie to this client to get the sale? OK boss, if you say so.” Both of those are wrong.  \n  \nI think a solid two-part principle is this: **a)** you should respect and obey all legitimate earthly authorities (Romans 13:1-2), _except for_ **b)** when doing so would make you disobey God, who is the highest authority (Acts 5:29).  \n\n#### **A Rebel Against the World**\n  \nThis one is clear if you’re a Christian: you should be a rebel against the world. Many times when the Bible says “world” it’s not talking about legitimate earthly authorities like in the point above, or the created earth, but rather everything in the world that is hostile, rebellious, and opposed to God. That’s what I’m talking about here.  \n  \nIf you’re a Christian, Jesus said that you are not of this world (John 17:16). This means that this world is not your ultimate authority or home. Instead, the world should be a place where you are living as God’s ambassadors in a way that loves Him and loves others, and telling as many people as you can about the good news of the gospel. That’s what Christian rebellion should look like! Every time you make a decision to honor God in your job, relationship, money management, words, purity, or any other area of life, you are being a righteous rebel.  \n  \nBeing a rebel against the world doesn’t mean that you have to turn into some sort of monk or nun and never associate with sinners (1 Corinthians 5:9-10). Instead it means that you should stand out from the sinful patterns of the world by showing it how God has changed you (Romans 12:2).  \n  \nWhat are some areas where you you need to be less rebellious? And where do you need to be more rebellious?  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"oGaSn7G3ZI62eKoYEuWUm"}}},"url":{"en-US":"be-the-right-kind-of-rebel"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/be-the-right-kind-of-rebel/"}}},

Nobody wants to be that guy – the one immortalized for making the wrong choice, the one who missed out on what Jesus had to offer because he held on too tightly to what he already had. I’ve almost made the same mistake multiple times, so that encounter with Jesus is incredibly meaningful to me.  \n  \nDo you have something that’s holding you back from going all in with Jesus? Whatever it may be, it’s not worth hanging onto at the expense of an abiding, sold-out relationship with Him. Dive into the Bible to see what you can learn from the true story of a guy who made the worst mistake possible – walking away from Jesus. And I hope you can learn something from my story too.  \n\n#### **1. Self-reliance will keep you from going all in**\n  \nDo you think that you bring something to the table in your relationship with God? That your “Christian resume” gets you points with Him? [I used to think so](http://www.theporchdallas.com/thought-i-had-it-all-together/). I trusted Christ at an early age, but I got a lot of my identity from being a missionary kid, pastor’s kid, youth group leader, worship band member, camp counselor, and all-around “good guy”. I avoided most of what I thought were the major sins like sex, drinking, and drugs. But I had no [community](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/community) around me and I was indulging in secret sins that I could easily hide, like pornography. I felt some conviction, but I thought I could fix myself and keep from sinning as much by trying harder. That never worked. I was having an affair with self-reliance, and it was slowly killing my faith.  \n  \nWhen I was in my early 20’s, God used the pain of my dying faith as a warning sign that made me call out to Him. And when I cried out to Him in desperation, He showed up! For the first time I experienced the healing and grace that follows [confession of sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+5%3A16&version=NIV). I learned that even if you are a Christian, as I was, relying on your own power to try to fix yourself will kill your faith and keep you from going all-in with Jesus. [You can’t do anything on your own](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+15%3A5-6&version=NIV).  \n  \nIt’s even scarier if you haven’t trusted Christ. Do you think that your good deeds will get you into heaven? It’s not going to happen. The Bible says that [people die once, and after that they face judgment](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+9%3A27&version=NIV). If you think that the “good” side of your scale is heavy enough to balance out the bad in that judgment, the Bible’s news to you is that even your [good works are like filthy rags](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+64%3A6&version=NIV) (literally, a used menstrual garment). [Only God’s grace can save you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A8-9&version=NIV).  \n  \nAre you trying to fix yourself? Whether you’re a Christian trying to do better, or a nonbeliever thinking that you’re good enough to get into heaven, relying on yourself is an absolute dead end.  \n\n#### **2. Fear of what you must give up will keep you from going all in**\n  \nJesus had some serious words about being willing to give things up to follow Him: _“Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it. What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?” ([Mark 8:34b-36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+8%3A34-36&version=NIV))._   \n  \nI used to be afraid of going all in because I thought that God would make me be a missionary in Africa, which I had zero desire to do. More recently, the issue in my heart has been money, which is why I resonated so much with the Rich Young Ruler. I have undergrad and graduate degrees in business, and I spent the first seven years of my career as a management consultant traveling around the country and the world. I was making six figures by my mid-20s, and I felt in control of my life and future because of my salary.  \n  \nAnd then, not quite four years ago, I had a conversation with JP while we were in Haiti on a discipleship trip. He asked me to pray about coming on staff at Watermark. My inner reaction was something like this: “Wait, what?! And make a pastor’s salary? I don’t think so, but thanks for asking.” But I did pray about it and process the decision with my community group, and over the following month or two it became really clear to me that it’s what God wanted me to do.  \n  \nWhat was holding me up wasn’t how a pastor’s salary would affect me as a single guy, but instead things like supporting a family, buying a house, sending kids to college, etc. – all things that are still in the future. Being afraid of giving up the ability to easily pay for all of those things could have kept me from going all in with this opportunity to join the Watermark team. But I very clearly felt God leading me to make the move, and to trust Him to provide what I needed, when I needed it.  \n  \nSo I took the plunge and the pay cut. A couple years in, JP asked me to summarize my thoughts on the transition in less than five words. I only needed two: “no regrets.” There has not been a single day that I have regretted going all in on what God was calling me to do.  \n  \nWhat’s the step of faith that God wants you to take? He may not be calling you to be an overseas missionary or work at a church, but He does want you to be on mission wherever you are! [He has good works in store for you that He wants you to do](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A10&version=NIV). Don’t let the fear of giving something up hold you back from going all in. Trust me – [you’ll get all that and more when it really counts – in heaven](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+10%3A29-30&version=NIV).  \n\n#### **3. Not realizing what you will gain will keep you from going all in**\n  \nIf you think you’d get a raw deal by going all in with Jesus, pay attention to His words from John 10:10, “_…I have come that [you] may have life, and have it to the full.”_ Life to the full! You may rightly believe that Jesus [gives you eternal life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+5%3A24&version=NIV) if you trust in Him, but here’s another thought to chew on…eternal life starts NOW. The abundant eternal life that Jesus is talking about doesn’t just start when you die; it happens as you live for Him right here and now.  \n  \nNow I don’t mean that in a prosperity gospel, health-and-wealth, God-will-give-you-that-lake-house kind of way at all. After all, Jesus also said in John 16:33 that in this world you WILL have trouble. In just the past month or two, people I know who love Jesus dearly have lost parents, lost children, and been diagnosed with cancer. But that doesn’t stop them from going all in with Jesus, because they know that God loves them and is [working in the situation for their good](http://www.watermark.org/message/4018), even though it’s incredibly difficult.  \n  \nIf you go all in with Jesus, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. If you don’t, you have everything to lose and nothing to gain! If you’re not a Christian, this world is as good as it will ever get for you. But if you are a Christian, this world is as bad as it will ever be for you! Heaven awaits.  \n  \nLet’s just say you go all in with Jesus, and life gets really hard. Your body starts to fail. Your job is hard. Maybe you even lose a family member. What then? Was going all in with Jesus a bad decision? Not at all! Let’s hear this truth from Paul, a guy who was absolutely all in with Jesus and was beaten, flogged, imprisoned, shipwrecked, and left hungry, thirsty, cold, and naked:  \n  \n_“Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. **<sup> </sup>** So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.” (2 Corinthians 4:16-18)_  \n  \nFix your eyes on the eternal glory that’s waiting for you if you follow Jesus. And go all in!  \n  \nHere are some questions to think about and process with your community group:  \n\n  \n- Where in your life do you think that you’re “good enough”?\n  \n- What are you afraid of giving up to go all in with Jesus?\n  \n- What is holding you back from going all in with Jesus?\n  \n- Do you really understand what you will gain from going all in with Jesus?\n  \n- What’s a step that you can take this week towards going all in with Jesus?\n  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1taMt6bygsmSguW8sEkWMI"}}},"url":{"en-US":"3-things-keeping-you-from-going-all-in-with-jesus"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/3-things-keeping-you-from-going-all-in-with-jesus/"}}},

I like to exercise, but running just for the sake of running is about the last thing I’d pick to do. Around five years ago, I got tired of saying that. A flash of motivation kicked in, so I decided to run the White Rock Half Marathon. You know, so that I could at least say that I _could_ run, but just choose not to 99% of the time. I managed to finish the half marathon in just over two hours, and was pretty proud of myself! But since then, I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve run more than two miles. In fact, I don’t even need a hand to do it: zero times. Like I said, I hate running. But as we’ll see, running is really important.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4138), we talked about Jonah. The first part of Jonah’s story is a classic example of running away from God. He didn’t lace up his sneakers for 13.1 miles, but he did jump on a boat and head in the opposite direction from where God told him to go. God got his attention in a pretty unique way, [sending a storm and then a whale](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jonah+1%3A4-17&version=NIV) to redirect him.  \n  \nWhether you hate running like me, or the treadmill or track is totally your thing, the truth is that we are all runners, and we’re either running towards God or away from Him. The Bible uses the imagery of running as one way it describes our spiritual lives. The important questions are, where (and how) are you running, and who is running with you?\n\n#### **Where (and how) you’re running matters**\n  \nThe Bible tells us to run [with our eyes fixed on Jesus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+12%3A1-3&version=NIV), [forgetting what’s behind](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+3%3A13-14&version=NIV), and [with a prize-worthy effort](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+9%3A24&version=NIV). Our focus should be clear, our direction should be forward, and our pace should be faithful. And when we fall, we should [pick ourselves back up and keep going](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+24%3A16&version=NIV).  \n  \nBut what if that’s not you right now? What if you’ve been running off-course in your 20s and 30s, and the consequences of the choices you’ve made are staring you in the face? What if you’ve stumbled and haven’t gotten back up? Maybe you can’t stop looking at porn or masturbating. Maybe you’re stuck in a cycle of unhealthy relationships. Maybe your “last time” of getting drunk wasn’t actually the last time. Maybe you’re saddled with debt. Whatever it is, you’ve gotten off track, and you’re not sure how to get back. Or maybe you don’t care about any of that, and your focus right now is on running wherever you want to go, pursuing pleasure wherever you can find it. Two things you should know:  \n\n  \n1. **There will be a reckoning**. The Bible says that God cannot be mocked – [you will reap what you sow](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+6%3A7&version=NIV). As Todd put it on Tuesday – if you like what you’re getting, keep doing what you’re doing. But if you keep doing what you’re doing, you’re not going to like what you get. Your choice to run in the wrong direction will have consequences, sooner or later. If you have trusted Christ, thankfully the ultimate punishment for your sin was already paid by Jesus' death on the cross, so you don't have that to fear, but God may allow you to experience consequences in this life as a form of [loving discipline](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+3%3A12&version=NIV) – not to pay you back, but to bring you back to Him. If you have not trusted Christ, God promises forgiveness to your repentance, but He does not promise tomorrow to your procrastination – you need to consider and respond to [the gospel](http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-gospel/)!\n  \n2. **God loves runaways**. [Nothing can separate you from God’s love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A38-39&version=NIV), and no matter how far off-track you’ve run, [God is still near to you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+139%3A7-12&version=NIV). If you realize that you’ve run away from God and want to change course, you need to [confess](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+5%3A16&version=NIV) and [repent](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+3%3A19&version=NIV). And the amazing thing is that when you do that, [God will run to you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+15%3A11-20&version=NIV)! God loves you, no matter where you’ve been running, and He’s in the business of turning runaways into [those who have been reconciled](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A18&version=NIV).\n  \n  \n\n#### **Who you run with matters**\n  \nAs you’re running, the people you spend time with will influence where you’re going and how fast you get there. You may want to run towards God, but if your close friends or the person you’re dating isn’t doing the same thing, eventually they’ll slow you down or drag you off course. You may think that “[missionary dating](http://www.gotquestions.org/missionary-dating.html)” is a good idea, but I promise that it isn’t. The Bible has some pretty clear direction on who you should choose as your running partners.  \n  \n**Proverbs 12:26** – _“The righteous choose their friends carefully, but the way of the wicked leads them astray.”_  \n  \n**Proverbs 13:20** – _“Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.”_  \n  \n**2 Timothy 2:22** – _“Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.”_  \n  \nI get three main ideas from those verses:  \n\n  \n1. It’s important to choose your close relationships carefully.\n  \n2. Choosing the wrong people will lead you away from God and lead to harm.\n  \n3. Choosing the right people will lead you towards wisdom and righteousness.\n  \n  \nIf you want to change and run towards God, but the people around you aren’t helping you run in that direction, [change your playground and your playmates](http://www.theporchdallas.com/changing-playground-and-playmates/). It doesn’t mean that you can’t still have a friendship with them, but you need to change the influence that they have on your life, and find people who will point you towards Christ. If you have no idea where to start, we’d love to help you with that. That’s why we talk about [community groups](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/community) all the time, because we know that who you run with matters!  \n  \nWhere are you running, and who’s running with you?  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"14LFlSEiF2KeQo8yGYkumY"}}},"url":{"en-US":"where-are-you-running-and-whos-running-with-you"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/where-are-you-running-and-whos-running-with-you/"}}},

That’s a question I’ve been asking myself a lot lately. In seasons, my closest friends have not only been black, but resembled Alton Sterling. I am often more comfortable in conversations with black people. I’d celebrate my daughters marrying a black man who loves Jesus. If and when we adopt, I’d have no preference on skin color. So, I’ve assumed I’m not racist and yet I’ve grown certain that there are prejudice values hidden in my heart. I am confident that you, no matter who you are, have the same problem. Please let me know if you disagree.  \n  \nI’m writing this to hopefully identify the differences that have come between us. I think you’ll agree with at least half of this article, and there lies the problem. Both sides seem to be experts in their hurts and from my perspective, neither has done a good job of understanding the other side. We have the opportunity to fix that within ourselves. But it will take humility, commitment, and focus. I’m not an expert, just someone on a journey like you are.  \n  \nI watched the videos of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile’s death and I was grieved. Then I lost a friend in the downtown shooting and I was deeply grieved. As I told my children what had happened, I wept. The pain was closer to home and the hurt was magnified. I have spent the last few days trying diligently to empathize with the black community, though I acknowledge that’s impossible because I’m not black. As I watched the videos I asked, “What if that was my son?”. Biased policing is deplorable and unacceptable, especially if it results in someone's death. The strategic murder of police officers by an enraged man is also a terrible reality. So what now?  \n\n##### **Black Lives Matter** \n  \nRecently in a sermon, although I am white, I said, “I’ve felt like I was African American most of my life”. My point was that feeling black, didn’t make me black. The truth is, I’ve never had many of the challenges that black Americans have. I am confident that black people often have different experiences than I do when pulled over by policemen, when walking down an aisle alone in a store, or when driving at night with their friends. I am sure that we are seen differently in ways that I am completely naïve to. I am also convinced that the problems we see are complex problems that date back to our country’s terrible sin of racism and slavery. There is a history of oppression, poverty, and abuse that is not easily recovered from. A billionaire will impact their family for generations to come. Likewise, poverty, oppression and abuse will do the same. I’ve made judgments that have been uninformed. Asking questions or making comments like, “Why does he dress like that?” or, “If he would just respect authority.” These are bad conclusions and ignore centuries of abuse that have long-term effects on how “authority” is viewed. I repent of my ignorance, and I’m seeking to learn.  \n  \nI believe “white privilege” is real, and it is inconsistent with a biblical worldview. Any “privilege” we have must be used in elevating all human life to be seen as God sees us, made in His image as equal. Police officers who have superiority complexes need to be dealt with justly. Officers with “white supremacy” values are not qualified to be officers of the law and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law they’ve been tasked to uphold.  \n  \nI don’t know what it is like to fear the men who are supposed to be the good guys. I don’t know what it is like to need to be trained in how you communicate that you are reaching for your wallet, not a gun. That is honestly something that I’ve never given much thought to. I don’t have a plan to educate my son of those methods in the ways my black friends have to.  \n  \nBlack Lives Matter indeed. It is insensitive to respond, as I am guilty of, with “all lives matter”. Everyone knows that all lives matter, but this movement is trying to make a point and a response of “all lives matter” belittles that point. Black lives matter says, “We haven’t mattered to you and that needs to change”. If you say to a breast cancer patient that “breast cancer is painful” and someone comes and corrects you and says “well, all cancer is painful”, while their statement is true it is also extremely insensitive. Black lives do matter and our country has a history of prejudice that we need to correct.  \n\n##### **Back the Blue**\n  \nAs I attempted to sympathize with Mr. Sterling’s family, I couldn’t help but wonder about the police. If I’m an officer, I’m not sure how I’d feel if this man looks like the many other men who hate me. He looks like men who have shot at me and killed my peers. From the officer’s perspective, he looks like a thug – not because he’s black, but because he dresses in a way that is consistent to the many other gang members and criminals the officer has seen day in and day out. White, Hispanic, or Black, it is difficult to not recognize the similarities of the people who hate you and want to harm you. To make matters worse, this man is not cooperating. He doesn’t seem to respect law enforcement at all.  \n  \nWhen two grown police officers are on top of a man with their guns drawn, and one of them shoots him at point blank range, it is an awful thing. I have to wonder what I’d do though. If I’m one of the officers and I think this man hates me and wants to kill me, this man has not yielded to anything I’ve said and he doesn’t seem afraid to die, I’m afraid. As I wrestle him to the ground, he keeps fighting and he’s strong, and then I see he has a gun and he seems to be reaching for it, what do I do?! I honestly don’t know the answer, and I don’t know if that’s the narrative. Some might say it’s irresponsible to write a fictitious narrative like that. It might be, but it seems a fictitious narrative is what the media keeps in front of us. The worst version of the story gets out and creates rage in people’s hearts, then an overcorrection takes place, then the cavern between us gets wider and wider. It seems the media is to blame for much of the hate that is stirred in this country. They aren’t telling the real story. Creating dividing lines and extreme emotion is what sells in the news world. Expressing your extreme emotion carelessly perpetuates the problem.  \n  \nWhile I don’t know what it’s like to be black, I also don’t know what it is like to be a police officer. Day in and day out these men and women are putting themselves in harm’s way for everyone – even those who hate them. Most officers are heroes. When their spouse tells them goodbye as they leave for work, the possibility of them saying goodbye for the last time is much more real than for my wife. Maybe black people feel the same way. Maybe black people and police officers have a lot in common. Bad representatives of any group, should not define the reputation of that group. That is stereotyping, a kind of prejudice, by definition.  \n\n##### **Two Schools of Thought**\n  \nWhen I see someone who looks like a thug, I feel some level of fear within me. That makes me wonder if I’m prejudice? How do I know the difference between prejudice and discernment? I don’t ever fear someone because they are black, but if they appear to be a thug, I do unintentionally label them as a threat, whether they are black, white, or Hispanic. How do I know how to label someone a thug? I’ve been educated to do so my entire life, dating back to when I was bullied in grade school and then jumped (beat up) in high school. I was being taught when I’ve been robbed or mistreated as an adult by a “scary” person. It goes back to hundreds of news stories throughout the years displaying criminals, telling my mind, “This is what a thug looks like”. My mind has learned what a thug looks like, and I don’t know how to avoid that education. Let me be abundantly clear, <u>I don’t think I’m talking about skin color</u>, and yet in ways I’ve naïve to, maybe that is a factor. I repent of that right now. I’m truly sorry. I want to grow through this.  \n  \nI imagine my black friends have gone through the same education as it relates to law enforcement and white supremacy. Since they were little, they’ve seen footage over and over of their heroes mistreated by police. They’ve seen stories of officers who violate the very law they swore to protect, and then it seems they are not penalized in accordance with their actions. They are continually taught a message that officers will treat you unfairly. They’ve repeatedly been shown horrific images of lynchings and slavery of their ancestors throughout the years. I can’t even imagine what this does to a person! I am certain it ingrains a different kind of perspective in someone throughout their lifetime. A perspective that is different than mine. One I’d have to experience to learn.  \n\n##### **A Lesson from Nature**\n  \nHere is a metaphor I've heard that helps illustrate my point. A deer in the wild responds differently to a bunny coming toward him than he does a person. A deer is not scared off by the bunny, but by the person he is. Now the person might want to simply feed the deer, or pet the deer, but when the deer sees the person, he sees a possible hunter. He sees someone who might want to kill him, and he doesn’t want to take a chance, so he reacts. Consider this metaphor when thinking about the police in an interaction with an armed black man. Mr. Sterling saw a hunter. He might have seen someone he doesn’t respect, or someone who wants to kill him. I assume, and maybe I’m wrong, that he’s been taught these guys are the bad guys.  \n  \nIf you are a police officer, an armed man – white or black – might want to hunt you. A policeman doesn’t know if they want to kill them or not. Until we can see the problem both ways, we can't see the problem. While bad police officers are a fact, FBI data says that a police officer is more likely to be killed by a black person than to kill a black person. Bad people are a fact. In our outrage, we need to seek to understand the other side too. To see a man and to judge him as a thug without knowing he is one is prejudice. Likewise, to see a police officer and to judge him as corrupt is also prejudice. The problem is not that this prejudice exists, it’s that it might be warranted. If it is, we all need to understand why, and give careful thought to both sides in hopes to eventually remove the sides altogether.  \n  \nI’m not surprised that people are sad or even outraged. I am surprised that we have allowed this to become an issue of race. That has happened because we haven’t tried to understand each other. We need to stop drawing these clear lines of black and white, or even black and police. If the officers involved in shootings were racist, they need to be dealt with justly. If they were afraid and acting out of self-defense, even if they were overly defensive, then let’s call them incompetent and not racist. The police force needs to be outraged by officers who don’t respond well in a situation they should have been trained in. All people need to call on their brothers and sisters to respectfully submit to governing authorities and not carry unlicensed firearms. I’m not saying these facts justified Mr. Sterling’s death – not at all. I am saying he would still be alive if they were not a reality. As a wonderful creation of God, Alton Sterling’s life mattered. My dear friend Officer Mike Smith’s life mattered. We need to be able to acknowledge both without discrediting the other. Let’s talk about it and seek to understand.  \n  \nLastly, Jesus knows all about prejudice. He was in fact, the most hated man in the world, while simultaneously being the most righteous. This is a victim of prejudice like none of us will ever know. We will be persecuted though, if not for our skin color, for our faith and that’s a fact. Let us unite under that persecution and respond in a way that is consistent with God’s instruction. Christ died for all racism, the kind that kills police officers, and the kind that kills young black men. He died for my unseen prejudice values and yours. He went in the grave and came out three days later without them. There is no racism in heaven, and so as we seek to bring His Kingdom here, lets do all we can to end racism, but it starts with you dealing with your own. If you didn’t agree with half of this article, you have work to do.  \n  \n- JP"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"7vzK5Uk5ZmiIeeyyWcU2WQ"}}},"url":{"en-US":"discernment-or-prejudice"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/discernment-or-prejudice/"}}},

That's less and less true. Like we talked about in the [first message of our One Nation Under God series](http://www.watermark.org/message/4315), America has drifted from the Christian values that it was founded on. The signs of cultural decline are everywhere, from our skyrocketing national debt, to the breakdown of the family, to the killing of millions of unborn children. For more and more people, being a Christian isn't what they want to be. [Recent Pew research](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/) shows the number of people in the U.S. who describe themselves as Christians has declined pretty sharply in recent years, dropping from 78% in 2007 to 70% in 2014. (For [Millennials](http://theporch.wpengine.com/generation-why-statistics/), it’s only 57%, down from 65%.) In a country with 245 million adults, that’s about 19 million fewer Christians. On the receiving end of that change, people who claim no religion at all increased from 37 million to 56 million, a 50% increase in just 7 years.\n\n#### **The Popularity Contest**\n  \nAs for why that change has happened, many people suggest that it’s at least partly because being a Christian isn’t the social advantage that it once was. Since America was long thought of as a “Christian nation,” saying you were a Christian (whether you really believed it or not) helped you fit in and be popular.  \n  \nThough the majority today still call themselves Christian, the Christian worldview clearly isn’t as popular right now. Even basic ideas, like saying that [children should have the right to live](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/message/3170) or that [people should (still) have freedom of religion](http://theporch.wpengine.com/sex-without-consequences/), are often met with public backlash. There are even a few examples of people losing jobs or losing business for simply quoting the Bible or trying to live out what it says. Though such cases are rare, they’d be nonexistent in a truly Christian nation.  \n  \nI’m not saying, at all, that American Christians are being persecuted the way that many Christians are around the world today. That would be unfair to those who literally face death for speaking up about their faith.  \n  \nAll I’m saying is that Christianity is becoming the minority view. Though most Americans say they are Christian, many of those [aren’t really clear what that means](https://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/167-one-quarter-of-self-described-born-again-adults-rely-on-means-other-than-grace-to-get-to-heaven#.VYXD-GD4tFI), and most of them [don’t have a biblical worldview](https://www.barna.org/barna-update/21-transformation/252-barna-survey-examines%20-changes-in-worldview-among-christians-over-the-past-13-years#.VYXF62D4tFI). They say they are Christians and then speak out _against_ biblical principles. So the biblical view becomes less popular; those who are only seeking popularity no longer claim to be Christian; and you have the current spiral we’re in.  \n\n#### **The Solution**\n  \nOf course, if you are a true Christian—someone who has trusted in [the gospel](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-gospel/)—popularity has zero to do with your faith. You don’t follow Christ because it’s popular; you do so because it’s the truth, and it’s the only way you can be saved.  \n  \nIf that’s you, you’re going to find yourself on the unpopular side. How do you respond? Do you, as some people have suggested, simply withdraw from public life? Stay quiet so you don’t risk offending anyone?  \n  \nI’d say the answer lies in Romans 1:16:  \n  \n_For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile._  \n  \nShare [the gospel](http://theporch.wpengine.com/the-gospel/). Do not be ashamed of it. Though some might try to shame you for it, and though it may be unpopular, it is far more important than any of that. “Because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes.” We’re talking about eternal salvation here, and the _only way_ to be saved (John 14:6). It’s the most important thing you could tell anyone.  \n  \nPart of the current popularity game is that many people want to portray the Christian message as hate. But truth is not hateful; it’s just the truth. And the gospel is the direct opposite of hate; it’s the most loving thing you could ever tell anyone (John 15:13). The gospel is the story of a truly innocent man willingly giving up His life to save a guilty death row inmate. And you, and I, and every person you know—we’re the death row inmate. Every one of us is guilty of something (Romans 3:23). Jesus died on the cross to take the punishment on our behalf, and that extreme act of love is the only way any of us are making it out of here alive (Romans 5:8).  \n  \nSo if you want to show love to someone, share the gospel. If it makes you less popular, share the gospel. If someone someday tries to outlaw it, share the gospel. If you find yourself in a place where it could cost your life, well, you know where you’ll be after you die. Share the gospel.  \n  \nAnd don’t be discouraged; the gospel is winning. It might not seem like it here, but that’s just one country. It’s growing mightily in many others; often, by the way, in places where Christians truly are persecuted for what they believe.  \n  \nSo do not be ashamed. Share the gospel. Your country’s eternity depends on it.  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(With help from Kevin McConaghy)  \n  \n  \n  \nRelated articles:  \n[Born This Way, Indeed](http://theporch.wpengine.com/born-this-way-indeed/)  \n[Re-Redefining Marriage](http://theporch.wpengine.com/re-redefining-marriage/)  \n[Evangelism: Works vs. Words](http://theporch.wpengine.com/evangelism-works-vs-words/)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"2j0RvumeMIEsuiOsGMYAM4"}}},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-live-in-a-post-christian-america"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-live-in-a-post-christian-america/"}}},

[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4145) we talked about Jesus healing the [Gerasene Demoniac](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+8%3A28-34&version=NIV), a man who was enslaved by Satan. Satan’s main objective is to enslave you to anything other than Jesus, and he will do anything in his power to trap you in ever-growing sin. In our day, Satan uses sexual sin and perversion as one of his most powerful tools. I believe that we will soon see a new flavor of homosexuality, sexual perversion, and bondage to sexual sin that is born out of pornography and sexual addiction. If you struggle with pornography or have children (or want to someday), I’d encourage you to read on.\n\n#### **The Power of Pleasure**\n  \n  \n  \nAs a culture, we underestimate the power of pleasure. Pleasure is one of the most powerful forces in the world. Pleasure is a key motivator in life. If someone experiences something that feels good, they will continue to return to it. If it feels really good, they will return to it even at great cost or great risk. This is simply common sense – people do what feels good to them. This is the reason people have unprotected sex, or look at porn so much that they lose their job. They see the pleasure as worth the risk. Sex, or specifically orgasm, is the most pleasure a human can experience naturally.  \n  \nWhen someone experiences this release, they are literally bonding themselves to their surroundings. More specifically, they are bonding themselves to the object of their focus during that release. This phenomenon results in many outcomes related to sexual addiction and similar struggles. This is one reason why sex complicates a relationship and why someone will stay with a sexual partner even when it is ignorant to do so. There are people who have sexually bonded to their car, to a relative, or even to their boots. There is one story about a man who could not experience sexual release without his boots on, because they were his focus during orgasm throughout his adolescent years.  \n  \nThis phenomenon results in people being sexually aroused while submerged in water, or smelling a certain scent, or being in a particular place. Their five senses have bonded them to their surroundings. Some psychiatrists call this relatively new phenomenon “sex glue”.  \n\n#### **The Design of Pleasure**\n  \n  \n  \nConsider, for a minute, the brilliance of this design. God made a person to bond with another person, for a lifetime. God teases this in Genesis 2:24, “_That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.”_ Creator God designed us this way, that two would bond together to become one. This is not a new idea; it dates back to the invention of humanity.  \n  \nThis design was meant to serve us and help us with monogamy. One man, and one woman for a lifetime. As their bodies change and age, they remain attracted (literally bonded) to each other because they continue to experience this pleasure together.  \n  \n**The Perversion of Pleasure**  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nWhen we take this and begin to experience release with different people, or images, or things, we are rewiring this bonding to crave variety instead of commitment. A porn addict who has not gone through diligent recovery work, will most likely never be satisfied by one partner. He or she is a serial adulterer; they have trained themselves for serial adultery. Their addiction is not to sex so much as they are addicted to experiencing release from a variety of images. Some porn addicts cannot experience release with anything except porn. They haven’t bonded to real people; they’ve bonded to two-dimensional images of people.  \n  \nThe slippery slope of porn addiction is bonding to images that become increasingly more and more bizarre and perverted. If you’ve drunk from this muddy puddle, you know exactly what I’m talking about. Porn is dangerous, and the danger makes it more appealing. Here’s why: when someone is afraid, their five senses are heightened. Their pupils dilate, their vision focuses, and whatever they hear, feel, smell, and taste is more powerful. This is one reason why affairs are so popular. Candidly it is “better\" sex – meaning it might feel more pleasurable, but it is also more costly and a disgrace to God. So, when you add fear and the bizarre into the mix, the bonding that takes place in porn becomes even more dangerous.  \n\n#### **The Enslavement of Pleasure**\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nPornography is a search for more. The two-dimensional, flat pictures will soon no longer satisfy. The consumer turns to video, then voyeur cameras, then chats with pictures and videos from real people in real time. While women certainly struggle with pornography, it is a man’s world 2-to-1. So, many of the “real images, real time” out there involve male nudity.  \n  \nThis doesn’t need to be appealing at first. It can even be gross. But its lack of initial appeal adds to the “I shouldn’t be doing this\" factor, which mixes with the powerful bonding agent of orgasm, and suddenly you have someone who is experimenting with same-sex-attraction in the worst way. They are creeping in through the dark alley of pornography. This same “formula” has implications for pedophilia too.  \n  \nHow do I know all of this to be true? Admittedly, this is not my story. While I was a slave to pornography before coming into a relationship with Jesus, my struggle was always of the heterosexual, legal-age type. What motivated me to write this blog, was hearing this story from others more and more (If you think I’m talking about you, I’m actually talking about dozens of you). People who never struggled with same-sex-attraction, have found themselves looking at and bonding to gay porn on their search for the ever-more obscure. This short-circuits God’s genius wiring of humans. Only a small percentage of the population identifies as homosexual, but my guess is that this number will continue to grow as people seek pleasure over monogamy.  \n  \nIf you delight in feeding your perverted sexual appetites, it is a great time to be alive – anything you could desire is available to you. But it will also devour you.  \n\n#### **Jesus Sets the Enslaved Free**\n  \nNow is an even better time to be a Christ-follower! These are the times where we must stand against what is evil. These are also the times where we must continually share the grace and truth of the gospel, telling an ever-more perverted world about the love and power of God to heal them from whatever addiction they may be facing. No addiction is too dark, twisted, or powerful for Jesus to overcome.  \n  \nIf you are addicted, we would love to talk with you and point you to Jesus. We’ve also put together some resources to fight porn in other blog posts about [how to overcome a pornography addiction](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-overcome-a-pornography-addiction/), and [how to hate porn](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-hate-pornography/).

My wife and I were honeymooning in Hawaii when Micah Johnson gunned down five Dallas Police officers and injured seven more. We found out about the shooting the next morning through some Porch volunteers, and I was shocked and devastated to find out that Sergeant Michael Smith was one of the officers killed. Mike was a friend of mine, and we had a great conversation about marriage the Tuesday before my wedding. I had no idea that would be my last conversation with him on this earth.  \n  \nIt felt surreal to be surrounded by amazing natural beauty while reading stories and watching videos about the ugliness of one man’s anger poured out on those sworn to protect our city. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know how to feel or what to think. So my wife and I did the only thing we could – we prayed and cried out to Jesus.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4178), we talked about the Bible’s antidote to losing heart in the middle of chaos. The world feels crazy right now, caught in a spiral of sin and death that began with the Fall in Genesis 3. It seems like some kind of trouble is always around the corner, and it’s increasingly hitting close to home. To people who don’t have a relationship with God, it may seem like all this suffering is proof that an all-powerful and all-loving God does not exist ([that is not the case](http://www.rzim.eu/if-god-why-suffering)). And even for Christ-followers, those troubles can assault our hearts and rob us of peace and joy, if we don’t handle them according to God’s Word. Hopefully it won’t be a shooting, but some kind of trouble is coming for you – [Jesus guaranteed it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+16%3A33&version=NIV).  \n  \nSo how should you respond? Jesus gave us a model to follow in Mark 14:32-42, when He went to Gethsemane with a few of His disciples to pray right before He was arrested and crucified. Mark 14:33 says that Jesus was horrified at the prospect of what was to come, overwhelmed to the point of death. He knew what He was about to face, and yet He still kept going. How did He do it? And how can you? Passionate devotion alone won’t keep you going. The disciples were passionately devoted to Jesus, but they still fell asleep in His moment of anguish, and they still deserted Him when He was arrested. If you rely only on your passion, you’ll fall.  \n  \nBut there are two things that Jesus did, and that you can do, that sustained Him in the middle of incredible trouble.\n\n#### **1. Pray**\n  \nMark 14:35-36 says that Jesus prayed intensely: _Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. “Abba, Father,” he said, “everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.”_  \n  \nI see three important parts in Jesus’ prayer that can be a model for us:  \n\n  \n- He focused on God the Father, affirming that everything is in His control (“Abba, Father, everything is possible for you”)\n  \n- He prayed a sincere and honest request (“Take this cup from me.”)\n  \n- He prayed for God’s will to happen, not His own will, acknowledging that God’s will was more important (“Yet not what I will, but what you will.”\n  \n  \nYou don’t have to pray those same words, but you can pray the same way. When trouble or tragedy strike you, hit your knees and focus on God, affirm that everything is in His control, pray incredibly honest prayers, and acknowledge that God’s will is perfect and sovereign. The Bible promises that the [result will be peace](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+4%3A6-7&version=NIV).  \n\n#### **2. Humbly Obey**\n  \nWhen Jesus had finished praying, the people coming to arrest Him were nearby. Trouble was here! Death was close! Jesus’ words to His disciples were simple: [“Rise! let us go!”](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+14%3A42&version=NIV) Only instead of fleeing the situation, like His disciples did, Jesus willingly headed straight into the hands of His betrayers, knowing that it would cost Him His life. He humbly obeyed the will of His Father, [knowing that it would end in joy](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+12%3A2&version=NIV), though the sorrow that came first would be incredible.  \n  \nWe can learn from Jesus’ example and do the same. As Hebrew 12:3 puts it, “Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.”  \n  \nWhen tragedy or trouble come in your life, whatever form they may take, don’t leave Jesus and run off into sin. [Don’t be surprised if the world hates you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+3%3A13&version=NIV). [Don’t be surprised that trials come](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+4%3A12&version=NIV). [Consider it joy when you face trouble,](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1%3A2-4&version=NIV) knowing that it is growing your faith and making you more like Jesus.

We had our own storm in Dallas on July 7<sup>th</sup> when Micah Johnson opened fire on white policemen, killing five of them. Again, a similar tragedy occurred in Baton Rouge, LA on July 17<sup>th</sup>. Since the shootings, there have been news coverage, media stories, blog posts (read JP’s from last week [here](http://www.theporchdallas.com/discernment-or-prejudice/)), social media opinions, and more. Many people are sad, confused, and angry, wondering what we are to do next. As Christians, we may not have answers for all of the questions being asked, but we do have the answer on how to seek the One who controls all things.  \n  \nJust like Peter as he walked on the water toward Jesus, we need to keep our focus on Him. If we focus only on our circumstances, we’ll get distracted and overwhelmed, and we’ll sink. But how exactly can we encounter Jesus?  \n  \nChrist-followers feel their affections stirred for Him in many different ways, but these three things, practiced faithfully, will help you encounter the Living God:  \n  \n\n\n##### **Read His Word**\n  \nI often hear people say something like, “I want to read the Bible, but I’m not sure where to start.” Every Christian has been in this place at one point or another. Some people think they need to start with Genesis since that’s the beginning of the story, but starting with one of the four Gospel accounts – Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John – is probably a better idea. Reading a Gospel narrative will give you a clearer picture of the character of Jesus and what He did while on earth. From there, read a few of Paul’s letters like Romans, Ephesians, or Galatians. Then go back and read from the Old Testament. Reading along with a commentary resource like [NET Bible](http://net.bible.org/) or [Sonic Light](http://www.soniclight.com/) will help you understand what the Bible is saying.  \n  \nOr, if you’re looking for a more structured reading plan, find a schedule that helps you to read through your Bible in year like [this one](https://www.navigators.org/www_navigators_org/media/navigators/tools/Resources/Discipleship-Journal-Bible-Reading-Plan-9781617479083.pdf), or [sign up](http://wmcc.jointhejourney.com/page/signup) for Watermark’s Join the Journey daily devotional. Have a journal and pen when you read so you can jot down thoughts or questions you have. Whichever method you choose, just pick one and get reading! God’s Word is [living and active](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+4%3A12&version=ESV) and He wants you to get to know Him today.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Pray**\n  \nNot too long ago a friend shared a quote that said, “Pray until you pray.” It’s simple and communicates an honest message about what prayer looks like sometimes. I can get really distracted when I first start praying. It takes a little while for my mind to calm down from all of the thoughts that bounce around in my head during the day. Even after I have quieted my mind, I can still get distracted as I’m praying… “what will I have for dinner tonight?” “I need to text her back.” “What was the deadline for that project, again?” We have to fight through all of the noise until we are abiding with the Lord.  \n  \nOr maybe praying isn’t something you’re used to at all. A great place to start is to pray what’s already in the Bible: The Lord’s Prayer in [Matthew 6: 9-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A9-13), a prayer of confession in [Psalm 51](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+51&version=NIV), a prayer of thanksgiving in [Psalm 138](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+138&version=NIV). The most important thing to remember in prayer is to have an attitude of adoration, humility, and intentionality. God doesn’t grade you on how eloquent or long your prayers are. He tells us [to pray without ceasing](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+thessalonians+5%3A17&version=NIV), and He wants us to share the depths of hearts with Him through our prayers.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Commune with His people**\n  \nIt’s really hard to live as a Christian without community. When I joined a community group, it completely changed my walk with the Lord. For the first time I had people holding me accountable, loving me enough to tell me the truth, and reminding me of God’s promises when I struggled to remember them for myself. One of the best ways to experience God’s love is through His people, His Church.  \n  \nIf you’re not in community – a group of people you meet with regularly to help each other grow in your faith – a great place to start would be becoming a member of a church and joining one of their small groups. At Watermark, you can go through [membership class](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/connect/membership-class) and [GroupLink](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/community/grouplink) and meet others who are looking to lock arms with their brothers and sisters in Christ. If you’ve been living in isolation, you could be struggling to encounter God or with submitting to His will for you – “Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire; he breaks out against all sound judgment” ([Proverbs 18:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+18%3A1&version=ESV)). Earnestly ask God how He would have you engage with community.  \n  \nThe Almighty God, Creator of the heavens and the universe, wants you to focus on Him even in the middle of chaos. He is the [Prince of Peace](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+9%3A6&version=ESV), [the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+1%3A8&version=NLT), and you can trust Him.  \n  \nWhat steps can you take to encounter Jesus?  \n  \n- Caroline Coffee"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1XjCeyXSpaKIKqYCc0i0iy"}}},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-encounter-jesus"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-encounter-jesus/"}}},

Everyone notices. Everyone else is different. Nothing about them feels like familiar. How do you respond? Do you ignore it? Roll with it? Freak out over it? Embrace it?  \n  \nMaybe this is a real-life experience you’ve had, like that time you were the only one who thought it was a costume party, or when you had to put a few gallons in your car at that sketchy gas station late at night. Or when you shared the gospel in an Ethiopian village, as many Watermark young adults have done this summer. Or maybe you’ve never had an experience like that, because you only surround yourself with what’s familiar, similar, and comfortable. Either way, [like we talked about at the Porch on Tuesday](http://www.watermark.org/message/4220), learning how to deal with differences in a healthy way is a really important part of being a Christian.  \n  \nI know what it’s like to be different and abnormal. That may sound funny coming from a married 30-something white male living in Dallas, but it’s true. For one, I’m a redhead, which means that only about 2% of the world’s population is like me. But more significantly, I also grew up in Japan as a missionary kid. It’s hard to look less Japanese than I do. For years, everywhere I went I heard people shouting “gaijin!” (foreigner). Some of them ran closer, and some ran away. Everyone noticed.  \n  \nI also have some diversity in my family. All of my cousins on my mom’s side are half-Mexican. Many of my other aunts and uncles were missionaries overseas. At our family reunions you might hear a mix of English, Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and German.  \n  \nI’ve been the first white person that someone ever saw while I was on a discipleship trip to a remote village in Ethiopia. I’ve also been the only white person in a house full of black people, hanging out with my Mercy Street mentee.  \n  \nThis isn’t about me and how unique I am or my family is, but I say all of that because every one of those situations (minus the red hair) happened because someone made a decision to get past their differences in order to follow Jesus. And that’s something that you – and everyone else – needs to do too. Here are three ideas on how to do that more and more.\n\n#### **1. Focus on what really matters: the gospel**\n  \nThe Apostle Paul, who interacted with all kinds of people, had a laser focus on the gospel. In 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 he wrote that the thing of “first importance” to him was telling people the gospel – that Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures.  \n  \nOne of the things that this gospel does is bring unity across racial, economic, and gender lines. Paul said in Galatians 3:28 that everyone who has trusted Christ is a child of God, unified with other believers regardless of differences. God knows that those differences exist – He’s not oblivious to them. But he does look beyond them, [focusing on the heart and not on external appearance](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+samuel+16%3A7&version=NIV). As God’s children, we should imitate our Heavenly Father in that. The gospel is for everyone, and it has the potential to unite everyone.  \n  \nAre differences a really big deal to you? Do you struggle to relate to or connect with people who aren’t like you? Maybe you need to spend some time thinking deeply about the gospel and what it means, and ask God to help you see people as He does. If you’re not there yet, ask God for help – He’s able to [give you a new heart](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel+36%3A26&version=NIV) and [transform your mind](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+12%3A1-2&version=NIV).  \n  \nHow can you stop thinking like a \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and start thinking like a Christian?  \n\n#### **2. Talk about your differences in a healthy way**\n  \nDismissing or ignoring differences doesn’t actually deal with them; it just keeps them bubbling below the surface instead of getting aired out. Whatever your differences are with people, talking about them with gospel-inspired grace will help you build a deeper relationship with them. As long as you do it in a loving way, it doesn’t have to feel like you’re a member of the bomb squad when you talk about differences, just hoping that something doesn’t explode.  \n  \nThis is a biblical idea. 2 Corinthians 5:18-21 says that as a Christian, you are God’s ambassador to the world, imploring people to be reconciled to God. An ambassador’s job is to build relationships and overcome differences, on behalf the Sovereign who sent them. When you face and engage with differences around you, you should be an ally, not an antagonist. A brother, not the bomb squad. A diplomat, not a D-Day invader. [Speak the truth in love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4%3A15&version=NIV) about your differences, with an [emphasis on love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+13:13).  \n  \nWhat are the differences that you’ve been avoiding that you need to talk about and engage with in a gospel-centered way? Where have you not been a peace-maker?  \n\n#### **3. Intentionally reach out to and serve those who are different from you**\n  \nGod wants you to serve people who aren’t like you. James 1:27 says, “Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.” And Jesus said in Matthew 25:40 that anything we do for the “least of these” is something that we do for Him. God loves people who are really different from you, and He wants you to love them too.  \n  \nThis is not always easy to do. Being a missionary was really hard at times. Sharing the gospel in Ethiopia required training, fundraising, and using time off for that instead of vacation. Building a relationship with a Mercy Street mentee took time and a willingness to hang out in a neighborhood that wasn’t like mine. The amazing thing, though, is that God overcomes differences as you serve as His faithful ambassador. Some of my dearest friends in the world are Japanese. I still share a bond and communicate with Ethiopian brothers and sisters in Christ. And God changed my attitude towards West Dallas from feeling out of place to seeing the people there as my friends. The differences are still there, but they just matter less. What really matters is the gospel-centered relationship that’s been built.  \n  \nWhat are some areas where you need to reach out and serve those who are not like you?

There are millions of posts on social media with hashtags like #relationshipsgoals, where guys and girls post about the relationship they have, or just as often – if not more often – about the relationship they wish they had.  \n  \nWhat’s your ultimate relationship goal? A lot of you probably want to get married someday. Almost all of my single friends don’t want to be single forever, and many of them are actively searching for a future spouse, or at least actively praying for one. For many of the thousands of young adults who come to The Porch every Tuesday, we know that one of the reasons you come is because you hope to meet that special someone.  \n  \nSide note – more and more of you probably don’t care about getting married, or at least not anytime soon. This is a trend in our culture, and [you should read this](http://www.theporchdallas.com/get-married-already/). Others of you might have – or are afraid you might have – the gift of singleness. [You should check this out](http://www.theporchdallas.com/gift-of-singleness/). Ok – now back to those who have marriage as a relationship goal.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4228) we kicked off our new series, Relationship Goals, talking about what the Bible has to say about the ultimate relationship goal: marriage. It’s important to start there, since what you believe about marriage will inform what you’re expecting, who you’re looking for and how you find them (i.e. dating), and how committed you’ll be to it.  \n  \nIt’d be impossible to fully cover how to have a healthy marriage in a single blog post, but I’d like to introduce three things that you should do if you want to achieve the relationship goal of marriage.\n\n#### **1. Work on the Right Project**\n  \nLet’s start here – how would you answer the question, “what is marriage, and what is it for?” Why do people get married? Why _should_ people get married? It’s easy to put together a pretty long list of what would be awesome about being married, like love, companionship, acceptance, and of course sex. But are those the things that God, the Creator of marriage, says that marriage is for? What is the “project” of marriage all about?  \n  \nHere are three reasons to get married according to the Bible:  \n\n  \n- To have companionship and help (Genesis 2:18).\n  \n- To have and raise children (Genesis 1:28, Psalm 127:3-5).\n  \n- To display the permanence of God’s commitment to His people (Matthew 19:6, Ephesians 5:31-32).\n  \n  \nThat’s not an exhaustive list of the only reasons you should get married, but if the “project” of marriage doesn’t in some way include these things when you think about it, you might not be thinking about marriage God’s way. And God’s way is definitely the way you should be thinking about it, considering that He invented marriage.  \n  \nIf you want to get married – what are your reasons for wanting to get married? If you don’t want to get married – what are your reasons for not wanting to get married?  \n\n#### **2. Choose the Right Partner**\n  \nIf you know what project you’re working on, that will help you choose the right partner. They should be someone who shares a Biblical understanding and worldview of what marriage is. If you partner up with someone who wants something totally different out of marriage, that’s going to lead to a lot of pain and confusion.  \n  \nWe’ve talked a lot at the Porch about who you should be looking for in a “sole mate” (and not a “soulmate”), and here is some of the best advice that we could give you:  \n\n  \n- Girls: [look for these things in a man](http://www.theporchdallas.com/10-things-a-woman-should-look-for-in-a-man/), and [don’t date this guy](http://www.theporchdallas.com/dont-date-this-man).\n  \n- Guys: [look for these things in a woman](http://www.theporchdallas.com/10-things-a-man-should-look-for-in-a-woman), and [don’t date this girl](http://www.theporchdallas.com/dont-date-this-woman).\n  \n- Oh, and [what about “the one”](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-know-if-youve-found-the-one/)?\n  \n  \nI know that we’ll talk more in this series about who to date, how to date, and all that. More to come there. But big picture, you should absolutely know what you are looking for in a potential spouse, and be able to give biblical reasons for those things. Before I met my wife, I spent a lot of time processing with my community group about what I was looking for in a woman. They encouraged me to focus on what the Bible says to look for. When I met her and as we got to know each other, it was pretty easy to see that she was the kind of girl that was worth pursuing, because I knew exactly what God said about who to pursue. And before we got married, I was 100% sure that we were working on the same “project” together.  \n\n#### **3. Make the Right Promise**\n  \nLet’s say you do find the right person to marry. Now, what are you actually going to promise to do when you marry them? My opinion is that most marriage vows are unrealistic, and they promise to do something that is impossible.  \n  \nHere’s what I mean: If you take them at face value, the condensed version of most marriage vows is something like this…“I’m so into you right now! And I promise to feel these loving things about you, and treat you in an amazing perfect way, no matter the circumstances, for the rest of our lives.”  \n  \nBut can you actually do that? Will you actually feel in love with your spouse every day of your lives? And will you actually treat them in a perfectly loving way…having them, holding them, or whatever…no matter whether they are grumpy, you’re running late, or you’ve had a terrible day at the office? I think the only realistic answer is “no”. Every married person I’ve talked to says that there are times when they feel or act in an unloving way towards their spouse. I’ve been married less than two months, but I can tell you the same thing – there have been multiple times when I have not related to my wife in a completely loving way. This isn’t pessimism, it’s just reality when two sinners (and that’s everyone) get married.  \n  \nSo what does that mean? Are our marriage vows blown? Do we need to just throw out all that sappy wedding-day stuff and move on with our real lives? I don’t think so.  \n  \nAt the beginning of our vows, my wife and I promised a lot of things to each other, like putting the other person’s needs before our own, treating one another with kindness, and being gentle with each other. Those are all great, but we put also put these exact lines in our vows after saying all that:  \n  \n_“I affirm that it’s only through Christ’s power at work in me that I can hope to love you in this way. I also humbly acknowledge that in my weak moments and my darkest days, I will fail in many ways to do all of these things. And when that happens, I promise to confess to the Lord and to you, to seek your forgiveness, and to do everything in my power to restore oneness.”_  \n  \nThese things may be assumed in some wedding vows, but why not actually say them? I’m convinced that a wedding promise should include these four things:  \n\n  \n- A promise to love someone, both now and in the future, regardless of circumstances. _This shows commitment._\n  \n- An affirmation that Jesus’ power is the only way to actually be able to love someone in that way. _This shows reliance on God_.\n  \n- An acknowledgment that you will not perfectly live out those vows every moment of your married life. _This shows humility_.\n  \n- A commitment to pursue oneness even when promises to love are broken by sin. _This shows a willingness to forgive and reconcile._\n  \n  \nWork on the right project. Choose the right partner. Make the right promise. It’s possible to achieve the relationship goal of marriage, and a Christ-centered marriage is an amazing thing. We’re excited to walk through these next few weeks of Relationship Goals together!  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"5H8OOMxyXCiC4wIoCSIOO"}}},"url":{"en-US":"want-the-ultimate-relationshipgoal-do-these-3-things"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/want-the-ultimate-relationshipgoal-do-these-3-things/"}}},

[The story](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A38-42) contrasted two sisters. Martha, the first sister, was distracted, worried and upset about many things, and busy with the preparations of serving. Mary, on the other hand, was the free spirit type who knew what was important in life – sitting at the feet of Jesus and listening to Him. Unfortunately, out of the two girls, my default is to be more like Martha.  \n  \nI don’t know about you, but it’s easy for me to get distracted by the tasks of the day. Our daily activities may consist of things that aren’t necessarily bad, or that might even be great, like serving people and caring for them. Working in ministry at The Porch, I can easily justify why my work responsibilities are important. However, I can never let what’s good distract me from what’s MOST important – spending time with Jesus.  \n  \nIn the Scriptures, Jesus himself said that out of the two sisters’ behavior, [Mary chose what was better](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A41-42&version=NIV). There’s something about Mary that I need to constantly remind myself of – she prioritized spending time with Jesus above all else. To be more like Mary in that way, I have to remind myself of a few truths every day…\n\n##### **I Don’t Have to Earn God’s Love**\n  \nIn my Martha-like mindset, I can get so caught up in doing good things that I forget that I can’t earn God’s love, even if I wanted to. His love and salvation is a free gift! Ephesians 2:8-9 says, “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— <sup> </sup>not by works, so that no one can boast.” I can rest knowing that everything I do is out of an overflow of God’s love for me, not because I have to earn it.  \n  \nAnother verse I remind myself of is John 15:9: “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love.” God’s love is perfect, and Jesus says that He loves me the way that the Father loves Him. I need to constantly remind myself of His perfect love for me and remain in that love in the middle of my daily tasks.  \n\n##### **Jesus Cares about the “Little Things”** \n  \nHave you ever been in these scenarios? You woke up late because your alarm didn’t go off – you accidentally set it to PM instead of AM. You feel really prepared for a test but when you sit down to take it you realize you studied all the wrong things and you’re about to bomb it. You are heartbroken over a guy but think that it was probably your fault anyway, since you should have paid attention to all the red flags. Sound familiar? Yeah, me neither (except unfortunately they do). In those moments you may start to think, does God even care about all this stuff? I know He cares about the “big things” in life like family members getting saved, solving world hunger, and the Middle East, but does he really care about the “little things”? The answer is YES, He does. 1 Peter 5:7 says, “[Cast](http://biblehub.com/greek/1977.htm) [all](http://biblehub.com/greek/3956.htm) [your](http://biblehub.com/greek/4771.htm) [anxiety](http://biblehub.com/greek/3308.htm) [on](http://biblehub.com/greek/1909.htm) [Him,](http://biblehub.com/greek/846.htm) [because](http://biblehub.com/greek/3754.htm) [He](http://biblehub.com/greek/846.htm) [cares](http://biblehub.com/greek/3199.htm) [for](http://biblehub.com/greek/4012.htm) [you.](http://biblehub.com/greek/4771.htm)” Notice it says ALL your anxiety, not just the “big stuff”. How great is it to know that the God who [numbered the hairs on your head](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:7) pays attention to you at all times, He cares for you and wants to [carry your burdens](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A28-30&version=NIV), and He is [there for you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A20&version=NIV) anytime you need him?  \n\n##### **I Can’t Do Anything without Jesus**\n  \nWhile I’m hustling around, feeling like a boss, this is the verse that brings me back to reality:  \n  \n“I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.” John 15:5  \n  \nApart from God, I can do nothing. Even as I write this blog, I’ve stopped and prayed multiple times because I felt the truth of that verse. I can’t write this on my own, I need my Father to help me. I don’t have the words to say to someone going through a crisis, but the Holy Spirit does. I don’t have the wisdom to make hard choices in life, but I have the Word of God to inform my decisions. Everything I do, I want it to be for the [glory of God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+10%3A31&version=NIV) and to acknowledge that it’s in [His strength and not my own](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+12%3A10&version=NIV).  \n  \nThe story of Mary and Martha is a great reminder of what is most important in life – knowing God, learning about Him by reading His Word, and connecting with Him in prayer. Martha had Jesus in the other room and she was distracted by other things instead of spending time with Him. That seems silly, but we do the same thing. How cool is it that we can spend time with the Creator of the heavens of the earth whenever we want? I’m a recovering Martha. My hope is that the more I remind myself of these truths, the more I let go of my to-do lists and let the love of God consume my life. There really is something special about Mary – she constantly lived in the mindset of Jesus over everything, and so should we.  \n  \n- Alaina Anderson"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"6lOebezA9GsOOo0M8MAUM"}}},"url":{"en-US":"theres-something-about-mary"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/theres-something-about-mary/"}}},

First: if you’re a Christian, what did you need to be saved from, and where are you most likely to need help today? Second: if you’re not a Christian, would you consider yourself a bad person or a good person, and do you believe that there are areas in your life that need to be fixed?  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at The Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4225), we finished the [A.D. series](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/resources/messages#p/ministry/1/The Porch:4) that highlighted significant encounters people had with Jesus. You may have heard of Zacchaeus in VBS or Sunday School – he’s the guy who climbed a tree to get a better view of Jesus, ended up hosting Jesus at his house, and then got saved and paid back all the money he had stolen from people. It’s a pretty amazing story of how his life was transformed after meeting Jesus. Whether you’re a follower of Christ or not, I think there are some really important truths we can grab from this story.  \n  \nOne of the points from Tuesday’s message was that there is no mess that cannot be used for ministry. That doesn’t mean you’ll become a pastor; it means that there is nothing in your life – no abortion, no eating disorder, no alcohol addiction, no secret porn habit, no materialism, no rage, no whatever – that God cannot turn around and use to showcase His mercy and grace. But before you can be used for ministry, you need to realize and admit that you’re a mess.\n\n#### **We all have a rebellious stage**\n  \n_To the non-Christian_: if you consider yourself to be a good person, to be called a rebel and a mess may be offensive to you. But God’s Word makes it clear, whether you’re a murderer or a gentle mama’s boy – [you’re a sinner](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+3%3A23&version=NIV), which means you [deserve death and separation from God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A23&version=NIV), and [your good works can’t save you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A8-9&version=NIV). You [deserve God’s anger because of your sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A3&version=NIV).  \n  \n_To the Christian_: hopefully you are well aware of your “rebellious stage” – you definitely had one, even if you don’t have the “extreme” testimony of coming to Christ after giving yourself fully over to porn, sex, drinking, drugs, or whatever. The Bible says that you were [sinful at birth](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+51%3A5&version=NIV), well before you had a chance to do any of those things. If there’s any part of you that thinks you needed less saving because you lived a pretty good life and avoided the major sins, you need to watch out for pride! [God hates](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+8%3A13&version=NIV) pride and [opposes](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+4%3A6&version=NIV) the proud. The Bible is clear – you either were a rebel against God, or you still are. Don’t sell your testimony short! You needed saving from your sins just as much as any other person on earth.  \n  \nThis one is personal to me, because for a long time I thought that I was a pretty good guy who needed a Savior because of some bad stuff I did as a kid, but then thought I was doing OK after that. I shared my testimony at my high school graduation, and actually said something along the lines of “this is a testimony about the gutter that God kept me from, not the gutter that God saved me from.” There may be some truth to that, since God protected me from experiencing the pain of some “big” sins, but I pridefully thought I was better than other people and didn’t need Jesus as much as they did. This led me down a painful road of sin for years.  \n\n#### **You can’t try hard enough to fix yourself**\n  \n_To the non-Christian_: you may think that religion is about doing enough good things to outweigh the bad ones, and that as long as you’ve done enough good, you’ll go to heaven when you die. Plenty of (false) religions believe that, but Christianity isn’t one of them. No matter how hard you try and how many good things you do, [you can’t measure up to God’s standard of perfect righteousness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+3%3A10-12&version=NIV). You might be able to control some kinds of behavior, but there’s always going to be something broken on the inside, at the heart level, where only God can touch. You don’t need self-help; you need a Savior.  \n  \n_To the Christian_: Are you still trying to fix yourself? Do you believe that you can do better if you try harder? Just because you trusted Jesus to save you, doesn’t mean that you don’t still need Him to fix you! You will always have an area of your life that needs to be healed, because becoming more like Jesus is a lifetime process that’s only perfected on the other side of death. But while you’re alive, [it’s God doing the work](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+2%3A13&version=NIV), not you alone. The moment you try to go it alone and fix something in your life apart from Jesus, [you can do nothing](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+15%3A5&version=NIV). Trying to do that is exhausting, futile, and faith-killing. I know this from experience.  \n  \nI bought the lie for years that I needed to try harder to fix myself. I trusted Christ at 8, but from 15 to 23 I secretly indulgenced in pornography. I felt guilty, but overall I thought that I was doing OK since I could hide it, and I hypocritically felt like it wasn’t a “major” sin like having sex or getting drunk. I tried to stop sinning because I felt convicted (New Years’ resolution, anyone?), but it never worked. After years of secret struggle, nearly hopeless from being unable to make any progress, I finally confessed my sin [to God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+1%3A9&version=NIV) and [others](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+5%3A16&version=NIV), and surrendered that sin to Him. And God transformed me! That change didn’t come from trying harder, it came from encountering my Savior’s healing power, even well after I had first become a Christian.  \n\n#### **Jesus wants to rescue you**\n  \n_To the non-Christian_: God loves you enough to die for you, and His arms are wide open to you! Jesus came to [seek you out and save you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+19%3A10&version=NIV). If you [trust Christ for the payment of your sins](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+10%3A9-10&version=NIV), you’ll be rescued from the consequences of your sin. If you don’t believe you need rescuing – watch out, because [judgment is coming](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+9%3A27&version=NIV), and it will not go well for you. God [promises forgiveness to your repentance](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+1%3A9&version=NIV), but He does not promise tomorrow to your procrastination.  \n  \n_To the Christian_: Do you think that you still need rescuing? Or do you think that Jesus rescued you once when you became a Christian, and now it’s up to you? Yes, the [penalty of your sin has been forever cancelled](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+2%3A14&version=NIV), and you are [not condemned in any way](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A1&version=NIV) because of your sin, but the truth is that there is still sin that [easily entangles you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12%3A1&version=NIV) and can [harden your heart with its deceitfulness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+3%3A13&version=NIV), and you need Jesus to free you from it. Maybe the message you need to hear is what He said in Matthew 11:28, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” If you’re a Christian stuck in sin, the answer isn’t to keep running away from God or to try harder to fix yourself. The answer is to admit your sin and return to God, like the [Prodigal Son](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+15%3A11-24&version=NIV) did, and finally experience the rest that comes from surrender. God [delights in showing you mercy](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=micah+7%3A18&version=NIV), and [He will not despise your broken and contrite heart](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+51%3A17&version=NIV).  \n  \nI’ve experienced the dead-end of trying to fix myself, and I’ve also experienced the freedom that comes from repenting and relying on Jesus to do it ([you can read my story here](http://www.theporchdallas.com/thought-i-had-it-all-together/)).

In English, you can love your car, your dog, your meal, your profile picture, your friends, your spouse, God, and a whole bunch of other stuff. It’s the same word, but would you say that it means anything close to the same thing? Nope. Since we’re in the Relationship Goals series at The Porch right now, we’re going to about what love means in relationships, specifically dating relationships. How you _define and express_ love in dating will have a big impact on how well you _actually_ love someone.  \n  \n[Last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4234), we talked about how love is a decision, accompanied by emotion, that leads to a commitment. All three of these things need to be there in order for it to really be love. In fact, I’d add one more: “Love is a decision, accompanied by emotion <u>and action</u>, that leads to a commitment. Without actions of love, any decision or emotion of love goes unfulfilled and unexpressed.  \n  \nBig picture: Christians are called to love other people because God loved us first ([1 John 4:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+4%3A19&version=NIV)), and we’re supposed to love one another in the same way that God loves us ([John 13:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+13%3A34&version=NIV)). The biblical motive for love is universal – God loved us first, and gave us the example of what love should look like. But in marriage, you love one human being in a singular and unique way for a lifetime. And since dating is preparation for marriage, we need to talk about what love has to do with dating. Whether you are single or in a relationship, here are some ideas about how love should work in dating.\n\n#### **Learn about love before you date.**\n  \nYou shouldn’t date until you know what love actually is. What is love? Baby don’t hurt me…just kidding. But really, what is love? Movies will tell you one thing, Nicholas Sparks will tell you another, Tinder will tell you something else, and your own crush-obsessed heart will whisper to you that it’s all about “the feeling”. Our culture totally whiffs on this, substituting real love for some cheap thrills.  \n  \nThe only place to reliably learn about love is from God, [who is love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+4%3A8&version=NIV). One great place to start is 1 Corinthians chapter 13, which is a classic chapter about love. If you’ve ever heard the phrase “love is a verb,” this chapter might be why – it describes love by the way it _is_ and by what it _does_, not by how it feels.  \n  \nBut there is so much more than that about love in the Bible, and it would be a shame to just skim the surface. Whether you're in a relationship or not, do some homework on this, looking up verses that talk about love so that you can learn what God says about it, and apply them to your life. Here are a few to get you started: Deuteronomy 6:4-5, Proverbs 3:3-4, Proverbs 17:9, John 15:9-13, Romans 12:9-10, Galatians 5:13-15, Ephesians 3:17-19, Philippians 2:3-5, and 1 John 4:7-21. Challenge: memorize at least one of these.  \n\n#### **Be ready for love before you date.**\n  \nOnce you know what love is, you need to know and decide if that’s what you’re ready for, or at least if that’s what you’re ready to take a step towards. You shouldn’t date someone unless and until you’re doing it to find out whether you might marry that person. Dating can be fun, but unless you’re doing it as a step towards marriage, you’re just opening yourself up to temptation and heartache. You’re better off staying “just friends” if they’re more likely to be your ex than your spouse.  \n  \nThat doesn’t mean you have to _know_ you are going to love and marry the person you want to ask out, or that you need to _already_ love that person. That would be awkwardly intense. It just means that love and marriage should be a reasonable possibility for you in the reasonable future, regardless of whom you date (be sure to [read the previous post](http://www.theporchdallas.com/want-the-ultimate-relationshipgoal-do-these-3-things/) about picking the right partner). I say “reasonable” because there isn’t a formula, and it can look different for you vs. another couple. Pray a lot, and get plenty of wise counsel here. If the possibility of making a future permanent commitment to someone you date isn’t on your radar, don’t even start.  \n\n#### **Decide how you will use the word “love” in a dating relationship.**\n  \nOnce you start dating someone, when will you drop the “L-bomb”? After a week? A month? A year? Ever? And what will the situation be? A long phone call late at night? After a romantic date as you walk her to her door? While sharing a cup of coffee at your favorite spot?  \n  \nOr how about “when you actually mean what love actually means, and are ready to commit”? You don’t need to know the exact timing of when (or if) you will say “I love you” to your significant other, but you should be on the exact same page with what it means, and the situation where you’d use it. This means talking about it early on, and not making any assumptions. Love has many mysteries, but when you’re going to say it shouldn’t be one of them. This will take a lot of pressure and guessing games off the relationship as you set healthy expectations and avoid having to wonder when it will happen.  \n  \nGuys: my advice to you is to wait to say “I love you” until you are also ready to say “will you marry me?” And girls – let him go first in communicating love. It’s part of being a man and leading well.  \n  \nMy wife and I did this, and it really served us well. Once we started dating exclusively, we had a conversation not too long after that about how we would use the word “love” towards each other. We decided that “I love you” means “I want to marry you,” and that we would save it until engagement, if our relationship got to that point. It made dating much more clear, knowing that we weren’t going to be saying that casually to each other, and it also made our engagement that much sweeter. The first time I told my wife I loved her (and the first time I kissed her, but that’s another post) was when I asked her to marry me. And let me tell you – it was sweet, and it was worth it.  \n  \n_We’ll pick this topic back up in the next post, talking about things like exploring what it means to really love the person you’re with, understanding the feelings of love vs. the decision to love, and what to do once it’s clear that you do (or don’t) love each other._  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"6hoTpgO48gMCqOcSIiYos2"}}},"url":{"en-US":"whats-love-got-to-do-with-dating-part-1-of-2"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/whats-love-got-to-do-with-dating-part-1-of-2/"}}},

And you’re not alone! We got hundreds of questions about dating over the past two weeks for our Relationship Goals Q&A, and [last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4309) we talked through answers to some of the most frequently asked ones. JP and David followed up with a live video session that’s posted on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/theporchdallas/?fref=ts) to cover a few more. This blog post includes some of those, plus others that weren’t covered, in areas like singleness, looking for a relationship, dating the right way, and getting serious. This is a mega-post with 20+ questions answered, the longest we’ve ever done. Let’s talk!  \n  \n**<u>SINGLENESS</u>**\n\n  \n1. **I’m waiting for a relationship. What should I be doing right now?**\n  \n  \nSingleness isn’t just a holding pattern while you wait for what you think you really want – the relationship of your dreams. It’s an incredibly valuable and important stage of life where serving God should be your biggest priority. I Corinthians 7:32-35 talks about a single person having undivided interest in serving the Lord, while a married person’s interests are divided because they’re also focused on serving their spouse. Use every moment of your singleness to [love God and love others](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022:36-40). Waiting for a relationship is fine, but not if you’re making the attention, attraction, and pursuit of the opposite sex into something ultimate. You’re not on the sidelines until you get married – you’re in the game right now! Spend as much time with God and His Word as you can. Serve selflessly. Live boldly. [Be a disciple](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+timothy+2%3A15&version=NIV). [Make disciples](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV). [Set an example for others in everything you do](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+4%3A12&version=NIV), and set your focus on the relationship that matters most – the one you have with God.  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [10 Things to Do While You’re Single](http://www.theporchdallas.com/10-things-to-do-while-youre-single/).

[Service Opportunities](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/connect/serve).  \n\n  \n1. **How do I know if I’m ready for dating and/or marriage?**\n  \n  \nWe talk a lot about waiting to date until you’re ready to marry. That does not mean that you have to be ready to commit to someone for life before your first date with them! It also doesn’t mean that you need to figure out your wedding date within the first three months of the relationship. It means that the purpose of dating should be to decide whether or not you _should_ marry each other and _want to_ marry each other. You should have the end in mind before you start. You also need to be connected in community with other solid Christians, [because this is a decision you shouldn’t be making alone](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+15%3A22&version=NIV).  \n  \nHere are three great questions to ask yourself and your community to help decide whether you’re reading for dating and/or marriage:  \n\n  \n- Do I know what marriage really is? You need to define it the way God does. For starters, read Genesis 2, Ephesians 5, 1 Peter 3, and Colossians 3.\n  \n- Am I at a healthy place to pursue marriage? (e.g. Do I have any unprocessed baggage? Do I need to recover from any addictions or habitual sin? Do I view relationships as an idol? Am I secure in my identity in Christ? Am I committed to purity?)\n  \n- Is the other person at a healthy place to pursue marriage?\n  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [Regeneration Recovery](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/regeneration-recovery).

[Check Your Baggage](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/message/4237).  \n\n  \n1. **Is masturbation a sin?**\n  \n  \nOK, so technically this isn’t a question about dating, and it’s not a struggle that’s limited to singleness, but it was asked a lot and it’s relevant. Masturbation was a part of my life for years, so this is a sin struggle that I personally wrestled with. I guess I showed my cards there – yes, I believe it’s a sin. At worst, it’s an [act of lustful adultery that you should take extreme measures to avoid](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5%3A27-30&version=NIV). At best – even if you can do it without lusting – it’s an unwise short-circuiting of God’s plan for sexual intimacy and bonding in marriage, and it enforces a self-centered and undisciplined pattern of idolizing pleasure and release. I don’t say that with an [ounce of condemnation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A1-2&version=NIV) – like I said, fellow struggler here. But I’m completely convinced that it’s not God’s best plan for you, whether you’re single or married.  \n  \nHere are three questions you can ask yourself:  \n\n  \n- Does masturbation come from a place of faith in God? Romans 14:23 says that anything that doesn’t come from faith is sin.\n  \n- Does masturbating increase God’s glory? 1 Corinthians 10:31 says that whatever you do, you should do it for God’s glory.\n  \n- Does masturbation represent self-control? Galatians 5:23 says that self-control is a fruit of the Spirit, and Titus 2:6 urges young people to be self-controlled.\n  \n  \nYou may think that masturbating makes it easier to not have sex, so it’s a win, right? Wrong. [God has given you other means of resisting sexual sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A13&version=NIV), and substituting another sin isn’t one of them.  \n  \n**<u>LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP</u>**  \n\n  \n1. **Should I date someone who is not a Christian or who is far from God right now?**\n  \n  \nThis one is easy – no, absolutely not! 2 Corinthians 6:14 makes it really clear that Christians should not marry non-Christians. If dating is for the purpose of marriage (which it should be), then you shouldn’t date a non-Christian either, or someone who is far from God. Missionary dating is a really bad idea. Instead of dating them, pray for them. Share the gospel with them. Invite them to church, and connect them with people of their same gender who can get to know them and care for them.  \n\n  \n1. **How important is attraction and chemistry?**\n  \n  \nAttraction matters, but the million-dollar question is, what are you attracted to? Are you attracted to godly characteristics and qualities in someone, or are you just attracted to their face and physique? [Do you value what’s inside, like God does?](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+samuel+16%3A7&version=NIV) There’s nothing wrong with being attracted to someone physically, but if that’s the only thing you care about, or the first thing you evaluate to the exclusion of everything else, that’s a problem. If you’re looking at porn or lusting at the pool or gym, that’s going to inform what you’re attracted to. Your heart is going to be led by your [never-satisfied eyes](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+27%3A20&version=NIV), and [that’s a sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job+31%3A7-8%2C11&version=NIV). Physical attractiveness is a depreciating asset, and you don’t want to invest there. Instead, focus your heart on what really matters, like someone who is walking with Jesus, and ask God to help you be attracted to the things that He values. And if you are consumed by lust and/or porn, heal from that first before pursuing a relationship, because it will kill any relationship you’re in.  \n  \nChemistry is hard to define and even harder to build a healthy relationship on – I’d encourage you to focus more on _companionship_. Do you enjoy one another’s company? Is the other person a great friend to you? Do you complement one another? Great romantic relationships are actually great friendships that keep growing. Look for a godly friend more than you look for a chemistry lab partner.  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [How Important is Physical Attraction?](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-far-is-too-far/) [How to Build a Relationship that Lasts](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-build-a-relationship-that-lasts/).  \n\n  \n1. **How can a guy let a girl know he’s interested?**\n  \n  \nFirst, stalk her Facebook page. Then, show up at her gym and get on the treadmill beside her…NO. Don’t do that! As men we’ve invented all kinds of passive ways to show our interest, and they aren’t helpful. You need to use your words, preferably in person, or at least by calling her. If you’re typing that message, you’re wrong. Don’t be passive – man up and talk to her. God has given men the role of leading and initiating in relationships, and “the ask” is a great place to model that. The “how” is up to you – be who you are. You can be creative, clever, funny, straight to the point, or whatever. Your job is to remove confusion, not add to it. Make it clear that you’re interested in her, and that you’d like to take her out on a date. Don’t leave her wondering why you just had that conversation and what happens next. If she agrees to go out with you, great! If she doesn’t, don’t pressure her or lurk around and hope she changes her mind.  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [Date Ideas for Less Than $15](http://www.theporchdallas.com/less-than-15-dallas-date-ideas-for-less-than-15/).

[How to Date Intentionally](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-date-intentionally/).  \n\n  \n1. **Can a girl ask out a guy?**\n  \n  \nLadies, you could do this, but I wouldn’t recommend it. You might get a date out of it, but you're just choosing your problems. Would you rather not go on a date, or go on a date with a passive guy? Well, you might enjoy the date more than staying at home that night, but you asking a guy out increases the chance of you getting a passive guy who might not lead you well in the relationship. You want a man who will pursue you and take the initiative.  \n  \nNot asking a guy out isn’t a biblical command – you might even point out the story of Ruth and Boaz in the Old Testament, where she showed some initiative in indicating her interest to him – it’s more of a wisdom principle. If you want to get to know a godly guy better, try serving together, or getting your community groups together. If the guy you’re interested in just isn’t getting the hint or getting off the couch to ask you out, you’re better off moving on.  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [Treasures Don’t Do the Hunting](http://wordsfromwags.com/treasures-dont-do-the-hunting/).  \n\n  \n1. **Is online dating OK?**\n  \n  \nOne of my favorite Proverbs is 19:3 – “desire without knowledge is not good – how much more will hasty feet miss the way!” In other words, wanting something without knowing much about it isn’t healthy, and moving too quickly could cause you to make a mistake. Both of these can apply to online dating. Profiles lie – that person can be anyone they want to be online. Is that even them? How old is that profile picture? Do they really love God as much as they say they do? That burst of interest you feel when you come across their profile – that’s desire without knowledge. Agreeing to go on a date with that person before you know anything about them or have anyone who can vouch for them – that’s hastiness that can lead you astray. Be cautious in online dating, involve your community, and don’t make any decisions about the relationship in isolation.  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [Is It OK for Christians to Use Dating Websites?](http://realtruthrealquick.com/christians-dating-websites/) [Should Christians Use Online Dating?](http://www.theporchdallas.com/should-christians-use-online-dating/)  \n\n  \n1. **How do I tell a friend who keeps getting into unhealthy relationships to stop doing that, without controlling their life?**\n  \n  \nProverbs 22:3 says that wise people see a potentially dangerous situation and avoid it, but foolish people keep going and pay the penalty. Part of being wise is helping your friends avoid a potentially dangerous situation too, in this case an unhealthy relationship. People are ultimately responsible for their own decisions, but as a Christian friend you have an obligation to[speak the truth in love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4%3A15&version=NIV), to [remind them of what God’s wisdom says](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A16&version=NIV), and to [encourage them to not get hardened by sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+3%3A13&version=NIV). Approach them humbly, affirm your care for them, be specific with your concerns, point to Scripture as the basis for your opinion, and encourage them to respond to God’s Word. Read Matthew 18:15-17 for Jesus’ words on how to approach a fellow Christian who is in sin.  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [What does “judge not” in the Bible mean?](http://realtruthrealquick.com/what-does-the-bible-mean-when-it-says-judge-not-lest-you-be-judged/) [What Do I Say to My Friend Who Keeps on Sinning?](http://realtruthrealquick.com/what-do-i-say-to-my-friend-who-keeps-on-sinning/) [How to Have Hard Conversations](http://cms-cloud.watermark.org/How-to-Have-Hard-Conversations.pdf?mtime=20150921120031).  \n\n  \n1. **Does age matter in dating? Is there a minimum or maximum age gap?**\n  \n  \nI remember a friend telling me a math formula for figuring out the minimum age of someone you could ask out. I’m pretty sure it doesn’t actually work that way. As long as you’re following the laws of the land, are ready yourself for dating / marriage, and are dating someone who is also ready for dating / marriage, you’re probably OK. I’ve seen relationships work with people who are really close in age, pretty far in age, and everywhere in between.  \n  \nI think the bigger questions to process are the _why_ questions behind a potentially large age gap. Here’s an example for the ladies – do you want to date an older guy because of his wealth and stability? And for the guys – do you want to date a younger girl because she’s hotter than the girls your age? There could be a lot of fine reasons, but if you want to date a person far from your age because of reasons that Scripture doesn’t support, I’d stay away from it. This is another great one to process in community and get wise counsel on.  \n  \n**<u>DATING THE RIGHT WAY</u>**  \n\n  \n1. **What does it look like to lead well / follow well in dating?**\n  \n  \nIn short, leading well looks like following Jesus with all your heart, and following well looks like following Jesus with all your heart. If you are both doing that, leading and following well in dating will naturally happen. The reason that general guidance like that is more helpful for dating (though it may not sound as helpful) is because the Bible doesn’t lay out roles for dating at all, because dating didn’t exist in Bible times. So we have to apply general biblical principles on how brothers and sisters in Christ should relate to each other, and follow those in dating.  \n  \nYou’re not married yet, so you don’t need to act like it. Ladies, he’s not your husband, so you don’t need to [submit to him as if he was](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5%3A22-24&version=NIV). Guys, you aren’t yet called to [love this woman like Christ loved the church](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5%3A25-28&version=NIV). But, both of you are called to [walk in the way of love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5%3A1-2&version=NIV) towards one another, seeking to [honor the other person](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+12%3A10&version=NIV) and [put their needs above your own](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+2%3A3-5&version=NIV). Guys, while you are doing this you need to treat your girlfriend as your sister in the Lord, [with absolute purity](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+5%3A2&version=NIV).  \n  \nYou should make it a priority to encourage the other person to pursue and deepen their relationship with Jesus, and to not hinder that in any way by how you relate to each other. If you do that, you will lead and follow very well!  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [Should Women Submit to Men?](http://realtruthrealquick.com/should-women-submit-to-men/)  \n\n  \n1. **How much of our pasts should we share, and when?**\n  \n  \nHere’s a short answer from a previous blog we did on this topic: share everything your potential future spouse wants to know or needs to know before you get married. Don’t intentionally keep anything from them. In marriage, [you become one](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+10%3A7-9&version=NIV), and helping them know who, exactly, they’re choosing to become one with seems the loving thing to do. We are called to [live in the light](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+1%3A5-10&version=NIV) and be [children of light](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5%3A8-11&version=NIV), and that means we’re not hiding our sins in the dark.  \n  \nThe “how” matters too. Don’t share anything in two-hour, late night, emotional phone conversations. Don’t share over text (I’m grieved that instruction might be necessary). Don’t share alone, late at night, in your apartment with no one else around. Share in person, in a semi-public place. If it is really heavy, you might consider including your community group.  \n  \nA full answer is helpful on a sensitive topic like this, so be sure to read the blog posts linked below.  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [When Should I Share My Past?](http://www.theporchdallas.com/when-should-i-share-my-past/) [Discussing Your Sexual Past](http://www.theporchdallas.com/discussing-your-sexual-past/).

Is that being unequally yoked?**\n  \n  \nDisagreeing theologically doesn’t automatically mean you shouldn’t date or that you would be [unequally yoked](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+6%3A14&version=NIV) if you got married. It depends on what you disagree on. If your disagreement involves [the gospel](http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-gospel/) being at stake, then you definitely should not date. But if you are on the same page about the gospel, and differ in other matters that aren’t completely clear in Scripture, you can still have a healthy relationship as long as you are able to extend each other grace, and the differences aren’t a continual source of conflict.  \n  \nHere’s an example from church membership (bear with me!). At Watermark, someone can disagree with portions of our full doctrinal statement and still be a member, as long as they agree with the essentials of the faith that we’ve identified from Scripture. To apply it to dating, you definitely want to be on the same page with the “essentials of the faith”, and you can graciously give one another room to disagree on other non-essential issues.  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [Watermark’s Essentials of Faith](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/about/beliefs). [Watermark’s Full Doctrinal Statement](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/about/beliefs/full-doctrinal-statement).  \n\n  \n1. **Is it OK to keep up other friendships with people of the opposite sex while dating, or maintain contact with an ex?**\n  \n  \nWhile you’re dating, you want to set up healthy patterns for marriage. As a married man, I don’t have any significant individual friendships with other women, especially other single women. That doesn’t mean I don’t still have friends who are girls – there are women who I work closely with at Watermark, whom I serve with at The Porch, or who are dating or married to good friends of mine. I would consider all of those women to be my friends, but there are two main distinctions that keep it healthy:  \n\n  \n- I don’t pursue or cultivate a one-on-one relationship with any of those women, and I’m careful to keep all of our interactions fully above reproach.\n  \n- My wife knows and trusts the women whom I spend any significant amount of time with, which is pretty much limited to the gals I work with.\n  \n  \nSure, you may not be married yet, but the habits and relationships that you have while dating are more likely to be the habits and relationships you bring into marriage. That doesn’t mean you need to drop all of your friendships with people of the opposite sex, but it does mean you should be wise in your interactions with them, and considerate of your partner’s feelings and perceptions. You should set and agree to healthy boundaries and expectations for each other in interacting with other guys and girls. Don’t be jealous or possessive, but do be wise and considerate. Lean on your community group for solid counsel here.  \n  \nKeeping in contact with an ex just seems like a really bad idea. Why go back there? They’re an ex for a reason – keep it that way. Since they’re someone who you’ve been in a relationship with before, it may be easy to fall back into patterns of relational intimacy that are only appropriate in a committed relationship, and you should avoid it.  \n\n  \n1. **If we are committed to purity until marriage, is it bad to daydream about having sex with them as something to look forward to?**\n  \n  \nIt’s good to be excited about having sex with each other in marriage! But it’s bad to fantasize about it beforehand. The fact is, you’re lusting after someone who is not your spouse (even if they are going to be, they aren’t yet), and [that’s a sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5%3A28&version=NIV). To justify it with “we’ll eventually be married” minimizes the covenant you make before God – you’re not married until you’re married!  \n  \nSexual sin happens in the heart just as much as it happens physically. Fantasizing about sex with your future spouse will make it harder to avoid having sex with them now, and even if you stay out of bed with them, it takes your focus off of Christ. [Flee sexual immorality](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+6%3A18&version=NIV) – don’t toy with it.  \n\n  \n1. **Is it OK for couples to spend the night together without having sex?**\n  \n  \nIt’s not OK, and it’s not wise.

Getting in arguments and conflict isn’t necessarily a sign of an unhealthy relationship, but _how_ you argue and handle conflict is a sign of your health and maturity as a couple. Are you often picking at each other about the small things and pointing out one another’s flaws? Do either of you get defensive and unwilling to talk about the issues in the relationship? Is your relationship more defined by conflict than peace? If so, chances are good you aren’t arguing well.  \n  \nConflicts between Christians should be marked by [humility](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7%3A3-5&version=NIV), [grace](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+4%3A6&version=NIV), [compassion](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A12&version=NIV), [love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+13%3A4-7&version=NIV), [gentleness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A12&version=NIV), [kindness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A12&version=NIV), [patience](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A12&version=NIV), [honesty](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A9&version=NIV), [truth](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4%3A15&version=NIV), and [forgiveness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4%3A32&version=NIV). If you aren’t able to handle conflict well on your own as a couple, involve other Christians you trust to help you process disagreements better. The Bible should be your authority on how to argue. Scripture’s approach to conflict is laid out in an incredible resource called the [Conflict Field Guide](http://cms-cloud.watermark.org/Conflict-Field-Guide-2016-PDF.pdf?mtime=20160223151716). Read it and apply it to your life and relationship, and you’ll find that you are handling conflict God’s way. If you or your partner are unwilling to follow the Bible’s teaching in this area, it’s a sign that the relationship is not in a healthy place to continue, since handling conflict well is incredibly important to a healthy marriage.  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [Conflict Field Guide](http://cms-cloud.watermark.org/Conflict-Field-Guide-2016-PDF.pdf?mtime=20160223151716).

A relationship is about getting to know someone and spending time with them, and not being physically in the same place makes that tougher. Sure, FaceTime helps, but nothing is a substitute for actual face time. A few quick thoughts on how to do it well if you find yourselves apart:  \n\n  \n- Count the cost. Before taking on the project of a long-distance relationship, you should have an idea of what it might cost you. I don’t really mean that in financial terms (though plane tickets are expensive!), but more in the sense of knowing what you’re getting into and having healthy expectations. Talk to people who have dated long distance to see what it was like. Don’t just go into it casually.\n  \n- Plan, work, prepare, and persevere – you have to be a lot more intentional to build and sustain a relationship when you’re not together.\n  \n- Stay connected spiritually. Pray together. Memorize Scripture together. Talk about what you’re learning and where God is growing you. Listen to a podcast and discuss it.\n  \n- Set healthy boundaries. How much will you communicate, and how? What does physical interaction and purity look like when you’re together? How often will you try to see each other?\n  \n- Stay connected in community. You’re going to be really focused on that relationship, so you need to pay extra attention to staying connected in healthy friendships where you are. You’ll need biblical counsel and plenty of accountability to navigate the long-distance relationship well.\n  \n  \nIt’s challenging, but possible, to have a healthy long-distance relationship. Both of my brothers had portions of their relationships that were long-distance, and they are now happily married to those gals. I’ve known others who have done it well too. It’s possible!  \n  \n**<u>GETTING SERIOUS</u>**  \n\n  \n1. **How do I know if they are “the one”?**\n  \n  \nNobody “is” the one; they _become_ the one when you marry them. Boom. Next question.  \n  \nOh, you want more? The search for “the one” is a fruitless search for perfect compatibility and effortless connection, born out of Hollywood’s broken model of relationships. Sin makes no two people truly compatible, so finding “the one” is a pipe dream. They’re not out there. They don’t exist. You shouldn’t be looking for “the one”; you should be looking for “someone who \\_\\_\\_\\_” and fill in the blank with what God says matters. Check out the linked articles below for the things that you should be looking for and basing your commitment on, like someone who is gentle, faithful, selfless, kind, honest, and much more.  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [How to Know if You’ve Found “the One”](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-know-if-youve-found-the-one/).

[10 Things a Woman Should Look For in a Man](http://www.theporchdallas.com/10-things-a-woman-should-look-for-in-a-man/).  \n\n  \n1. **What if I don’t have “the feeling” in my relationship? Is having doubts about the relationship a deal-breaker?**\n  \n  \nOne of the best pieces of relationship advice I got was this: “You shouldn’t be looking for someone you _can’t live without;_ you should be looking for someone you _can live with_, and commit to them for the rest of your life.” It was basically this – redefine what you think love is, and make it a commitment instead of just a feeling. Feelings are real, but they aren’t reliable, and they aren’t solid enough to base a lifetime relationship decision on. This is similar to the mythical search for “the one” – you can’t make it just about your feelings.  \n  \nThat doesn’t mean you should just power through and marry someone you have zero feelings for, but it does mean that you shouldn’t sacrifice an otherwise healthy relationship on the altar of feelings. It comes down to a choice to love someone, and that’s a choice you make every day for the rest of your life, even after you’re married. I’ve heard it said that feelings of love follow the choice to love and actions of love, and I’ve seen that as true in my own life and others.  \n  \nIf you’re consistently struggling with doubts about the relationship, you need to take a look at your doubts, both in general and specific to the relationship. For example – are you a person who generally struggles with doubts? If so, that may be a deeper issue than just your relationship, and the relationship may not be the problem at all. Or more specifically, what are you doubting in the relationship? If it’s the other person’s faith, then that’s a great thing to lean into, and potentially call off the relationship over. But if it’s doubts about something that isn’t at the core of the relationship, like their hobbies, or their parents, then it’s fair to push through your doubts and keep your focus on the main things that matter – their love for God and love for you.  \n  \n_Other resources:_ [What’s Love Got to do with Dating?

[What is Love?](http://www.watermark.org/message/4234)  \n\n  \n1. **When should you get engaged?**\n  \n  \nThere’s no set timeframe for how long you should date; it depends on the situation. The key to making a good decision here is to act wisely, trusting in the wisdom from God’s Word and the godly counsel of people who you’re sharing life with.  \n  \nThere are some good reasons to date for a shorter time than you think, and some good reasons to wait longer than you think. It depends on what’s “short” and “long” to you. My parents were married about six months after they met; my wife and I took about two years from meeting to married. I don’t see a lot of good reasons for waiting much longer than that. Dating for years and years and years? No thanks.  \n  \nOverall, you want to date only as long as you need to. It’s probably shorter than you think, but it should be strategic so that you can make sure that they are who you think they are. Then, when you know that they are committed to Christ and would make a great life companion for you, put a ring on it.  \n  \n_Other resources:_[How Long Should You Date Before Marriage?](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-long-should-you-date-before-marriage/) [Get Married Already](http://www.theporchdallas.com/get-married-already/).  \n  \n-----------  \n  \nThanks for submitting your questions about dating!

This week we’ll cover four more ideas of how love and dating go together._\n\n##### **1) Learn to love the person you’re dating.**\n  \nI can see some of you thinking, “Wait – you just told me to hold off on ‘I love you’ until we get engaged, and now you want to talk about how to love the person I’m dating?” Yes. The advice to hold back on saying “I love you” is to set healthy expectations and avoid painful confusion in dating, because our culture has made those words mean very little. We want to raise the bar on what “I love you” means in dating. But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be learning to love the person you’re dating – first as a brother or sister in Christ, and then as a potential partner for life. Live it before you say it.  \n  \nAs you’re dating, you need to learn to love the other person both generally and specifically. There are some parts of love that are universal and should apply to your relationships with anyone [(for example, being patient, kind, humble, etc.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+13%3A4&version=NIV)), and then are other parts of love that are unique and specific to a committed relationship. As long as you have healthy boundaries for what love should _not_ mean in dating (e.g. [sex](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/), [cohabitation](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-not-live-together/), etc.), it’s a great time to grow in your love for one another. Here are three ways you can do that.  \n\n  \n- **Spend time with one another.** One way that you can spell love is T-I-M-E. This one might seem really obvious, but you can’t get to know someone without spending time with them. I mean that in two ways – quantity (how much) and duration (how long). There isn’t a formula for how much time you should spend with the person you’re dating, or for how long you need to date before taking the next step, but you should consider and get counsel on both of those things. Two general suggestions I’d make: 1) prioritize the relationship, but don’t make it an idol that consumes all of your time, and 2) don’t rush [or be hasty](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+19%3A2&version=NIV) in making a decision about the future. Give it time.\n  \n  \n\n  \n- **Learn one another.** Dating shouldn’t be aimless – the point is to get to know someone really well. Dinner and a movie won’t tell you everything you need to know. As you spend time with the other person, study and observe them on purpose. Ask thought-provoking questions. Learn their habits and tendencies. See how their faith plays out in daily life. [Be creative](http://www.theporchdallas.com/less-than-15-dallas-date-ideas-for-less-than-15/). Get them in unique environments to see how they respond. Serve together. Find out what makes them feel appreciated and cared for. In marriage you’ll need to be a good student of your spouse, and dating is a great time to learn how to study!\n  \n- **Consider a premarital class.** Watermark has a premarital class for seriously dating and engaged couples that’s called [Merge](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/merge). It’s a chance to learn, get wisdom, and receive counsel about marriage in a safe, fun, and authentic environment. If you’re seriously dating and considering marriage, a class like this can help you prepare for the next step in your relationship and get to know each other at a deeper level. My wife and I did this as a dating couple, and we highly recommend it.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##### **2) Understand the decision to love and the emotions of love.**\n  \nFor many people, this is the million-dollar question: “am I in love?” [Like we talked about a few weeks ago](http://www.watermark.org/message/4234), falling in love sounds like something that happens to you, like catching the flu, or being caught up in some uncontrollable force. For some of you, this is the way that you naturally view love, since you process primarily with your feelings and emotions (and maybe you’ve watched too many romantic comedies). For others, that’s a confusing definition because you process with facts and logic, and “falling in love” doesn’t really make sense to your rational mind. Either way, it’s the wrong question.  \n  \nI’d like to rephrase the question from “am I _in_ love with this person?” to “_do_ I love this person?” and “am I _willing_ to love this person even when they seem unlovable?” The reality is that love is an interplay of decisions, actions, and emotions. It’s important to examine your own expectations about love to see if they line up with God’s definition and expectations. Here are a few ideas:  \n\n  \n- **Love’s foundation is a decision**. To love someone is more of a conscious act of the will and heart than it is an uncontrollable flow of emotions. It is certainly more than _just_ a decision we make ourselves, since it [comes from God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+4%3A7&version=NIV), but the decision to love someone is more important than constantly having feelings of love for them.\n  \n- **Love’s expression is through action**. The Bible says that we should [“walk in the way of love”](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5%3A1-6&version=NIV). Love without action is only an empty sentiment; it needs to be shown to be real.\n  \n- **Love’s accompaniment is emotion**. Emotions of love – things like happiness, peace, joy, contentment, excitement, passion, etc. – are an awesome gift in relationships. If you aren’t feeling any of those things at all, that’s something you should pay attention to and get wise counsel about whether the relationship is a healthy one. On the other hand, emotions ebb and flow even in healthy relationships, so don’t freak out if there are times where you don’t “feel” love, since that’s not the foundation of the relationship. Even if you aren’t _feeling_ uncontrollably powerful emotions of love towards someone, you can still _actually_ love them in the way that God says to.\n  \n- **Most importantly, love should be rooted in Gods definition**. Ultimately, you have to come back to what the Bible says love is. [Our pastor Todd Wagner wrote an excellent blog post about “How Do You Know When You Love a Girl?”](http://wordsfromwags.com/how-do-you-know-when-you-love-a-girl/) There’s a ton of Scripture in there that reveals God’s perspective on love, and I would encourage you to read through it whether you’re a guy or girl.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##### **3) If you do not or cannot love each other, don’t stay together.**\n  \n  \n  \nIf it’s clear that both of you do not or cannot choose to love each other in the way that would lead to a permanent commitment, you should end the relationship in a gentle and clear way. Don’t make this decision hastily, and don’t do it in isolation! Get wise counsel and pray a lot. But if that’s where you are, and the relationship has no path forward, ending it is actually the loving thing to do. For more perspective on ending a relationship, [read this post about breaking up](http://www.theporchdallas.com/9-signs-you-should-break-up/).  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##### **4) If you do truly love each other, show it with a promise and a commitment.**\n  \nWe started off the post by saying that love should lead to a commitment. If you’ve dated in a Christ-honoring way, have received and submitted to wise and godly counsel about your relationship, and are on the same page about taking the next step, then make the commitment!

Depending on how well we know each other, you might be shocked by that. Maybe you’re thinking, “aren't you 34 – what took you so long?” Or, “oh no – what happened?!” Or even “why would you confess that in a blog?” Well, it’s not really that dramatic; I got married and “lost” my virginity to my wife. Is my story a Christian sexual success? In some ways yes, since I waited to have sex until I was married, [but that doesn't mean I was free from sexual sin.](http://www.theporchdallas.com/thought-i-had-it-all-together/) I’m grateful for God’s grace and forgiveness!  \n  \nYour story with sex is probably a mixed bag too. One thing is sure – sexual purity is an uphill fight. A recent article about young adults and sex headlined the [“skyrocketing rates of abstinence”](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/study-finds-skyrocketing-rate-of-abstinence-among-millennials) among Millennials. It said that fewer Millennials age 20-24 are having sex compared to previous generations. The study looked at the percentage of Millennials age 20-24 who have _not_ had sex since turning 18. The number?  \n  \nFifteen percent.  \n  \nThat’s right – only 15% of Millennials age 20-24 have _not_ had sex since turning 18 according to that study. Skyrocketing abstinence? Houston, we still have a problem.  \n  \nSex isn’t the problem, though. Sex is awesome, and God invented it that way. [God is very pro-sex](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1%3A28&version=NIV)! But sex outside of marriage is the problem, and any kind of sexual activity or desire that’s indulged outside of a marriage relationship. Porn, masturbation, sexting, fantasies, hookups, or whatever – even the clickbait and “sex sells” ads that are everywhere – it’s all part of how sex has gotten twisted by sin. It’s hard to escape it.  \n\n#### **How You Can Fight for Purity**\n  \nSo what are you supposed to do? How can you as a Christian young adult fight for sexual purity when sex is everywhere? [Like we talked about last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4246), purity is possible because the Holy Spirit is working in us. But what are some of the tools that He gives us to fight with? Here are five things that can help you fight for sexual purity.  \n\n#### **1) Confess your sexual sin**\n  \n _“If we confess our sins, [God] is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9). “…Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed…” (James 5:16)_  \n  \nIf you sin sexually, the first thing that you need to do is confess it – this means telling God and other Christians in your life exactly what you did, and [that it was wrong](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/). Don’t hold onto it for weeks or months, and don’t just confess part of it – confess quickly and fully! God already knows what you did and [isn’t mad at you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+103%3A8-14&version=NIV), but like a loving dad He wants you to talk to Him about it. And other Christians need to know so that they can pray for you to be healed, and help you in the fight for purity. Confession is a gift! And keep in mind that even if you keep sin a secret, [you’re not really getting away with it](http://www.theporchdallas.com/getting-away-with-it/), and [it won’t go well for you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+28%3A13&version=NIV). Ouch.  \n\n#### **2) Be sorry for your sexual sin**\n  \n_“Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.” (2 Corinthians 7:10)_  \n  \nAre you sorry that you sinned sexually, or are you sorry that you got caught? A good way to tell is by what you do afterwards. Do you feel bad for a little while, and then do nothing differently and get stuck right back in the same sin? That’s probably worldly sorrow, and it’s a destructive cycle. But if you are genuinely grieved over your sin, and take steps to turn away from it (repentance), that sounds like godly sorrow.  \n  \nYou know that “what was I thinking?!” moment that comes after you sin sexually, where you can’t believe what you just did? Don’t waste your regret – channel it to take steps that will help you fight sin in the future. Temptation is coming again, and you’ll need to be ready. _([Listen to this message](http://www.watermark.org/message/3676) for more about how to respond to sexual sin.)_  \n\n#### **3) Do whatever it takes to fight sexual sin**\n  \n_“…if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away…” (Matthew 5:30). “The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty. (Proverbs 22:3)_  \n  \nAre you willing to do whatever it takes to fight sexual sin? Can you see in advance what situations might lead you to sin, and are you willing to avoid them? If not, you probably aren’t experiencing godly sorrow yet, and you should pray that you do. Instead of asking “[how far is too far?](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-far-is-too-far/)” you should be asking how far you can go to pursue purity. Are you willing to change your habits? Relationship? Friends? Entertainment? Job? Living situation? Computer? Phone? Anything that might be leading you to lust or sin sexually? Maybe it’s getting rid of your smartphone, changing where you spend your time, or starting a [Christ-centered recovery program](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/regeneration-recovery). The point is, do whatever it takes to address the things that are leading you to sin sexually.  \n  \nHere’s an example: when my wife and I started dating, [we decided to not kiss](http://www.theporchdallas.com/when-should-you-kiss-in-dating/) until we got engaged (if we got to that point). We were really attracted to each other, but we didn’t want to be distracted by the physical, and we wanted to help each other fight sexual sin. It wasn’t easy, and some people thought we were crazy, but it was one of the best decisions that we made! Now that we’re married we get to be as physical as we want, and we don’t regret for a second that we barely kissed until we were husband and wife. Waiting was worth it.  \n\n#### **4) Get accountability to fight sexual sin**\n  \n_“Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.” (2 Timothy 2:22)_  \n  \nOne thing is for sure – if you try to fight sexual sin on your own, you have no chance of success. At some point, no matter how strong you are, your willpower will wear down, temptation will feel overwhelming, and sin will seem so attractive that you give in. [If you think you’re strong and can handle it on your own, watch out](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A12&version=NIV)! Read what Paul told Timothy in the verse above again: you shouldn’t run away from sin and toward righteousness by yourself! Other Christians in your life can [encourage you in the fight](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+3%3A13&version=NIV), [remind you of what’s true](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A16&version=NIV), and [help pick you back up if you blow it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+6%3A1-2&version=NIV). These people need to know exactly where you struggle, and they should know the steps that you are taking to fight sexual sin, so that they can help you stick to them.  \n  \nAnd don’t make the mistake of thinking that true accountability is just a group of people that you confess your sins to after you’ve already committed them! You won’t experience freedom from sexual sin if you only use accountability to describe your sin after it happens, instead of reaching out for help in the middle of being tempted.  \n  \nDoes this sound anything like the accountability you’re used to? “Hey guys/girls, I messed up sexually this week. I [looked at porn / masturbated / went too far with my boyfriend/girlfriend, etc.]. I confessed to God and we’re good, but I just wanted you to know.” Response: “Thank you for sharing that. I/we messed up in [whatever sexual sin] too. Let’s pray for each other.” That’s not real accountability; that’s just commiserating with each other.  \n  \n[Confessing and praying for each other is great](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+5%3A16&version=NIV), but at that point it’s too late – you already fought alone and you lost. You need help while you’re actually in the battle! That means you need to commit to reaching out sooner, asking for prayer and confessing what you’re tempted to do before you do it. This is more like what I’m talking about: “Hey guys, I’m feeling tempted to [insert sexual sin] – can we pray together and can you share some Scripture with me?” Even a quick call or text is better than going it alone. Even better, meet in person. You probably need accountability earlier than you think, and more often than you think.  \n\n#### **5) Look to Jesus to heal your sexual sin**\n  \n_“…let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles… **<sup> </sup>** fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith…” (Hebrews 12:1-2). “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.” (John 15:5)_  \n  \nIf you follow the first four steps but miss this one, all of those steps are empty and will fail you at some point. Real, lasting change only comes if you are relying on Jesus’ power to make it happen. He said it Himself – apart from Him, you can do nothing.  \n  \nYour focus can’t just be on fighting sexual sin; you need to fight even harder for your relationship with Jesus. [Read His Word](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+1%3A1-3&version=NIV). [Memorize it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+119%3A11&version=NIV). [Do what He says in it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14%3A15&version=NIV). [Pray to Him continually](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16-18&version=NIV). [Ask Him for help](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+5%3A1%604-15&version=NIV). [Rest in His love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+11%3A28-30&version=NIV). [Trust in His grace](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+4%3A15-16&version=NIV). Know that [He is working in you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+1%3A6&version=NIV), even when you may not feel it in the moment. Put your focus completely on the One who has the power to heal you, and [the healing will come](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+30%3A2&version=NIV).  \n  \nIf you’d like help in your fight for sexual purity, we’d love to meet you at [Re:generation Recovery](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/regeneration-recovery).

If you were both mega-millionaires, talented and famous, and incredibly attractive? You might be able to make it last, but those things wouldn’t be the reason. They might actually make it harder.  \n  \nIf there’s ever been a couple that shows how empty and messed up Hollywood’s way of building relationships and marriage is, it’s Brad and Angelina. They have it all from a worldly standpoint – the looks, the money, the talent, the fame, and pretty much whatever else you might want – and still it’s all come crashing down with their recent filing for divorce. Which would you rather have: $400 million in net worth, or a marriage that lasts?  \n  \nLike we talked about last [Tuesday at The Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4286), Hollywood gets it wrong a lot of the time when it comes to relationships. And here’s the other, bigger, problem that matters even if you don’t read the tabloids – it’s not _whether_ you’ve bought into Hollywood’s way of doing relationships; it’s _how much_. You may not be willing to admit it, but I’m betting that there’s a part of your heart that longs for a version of the red-hot romance, manic highs, and nonstop passionate emotions that we see on TV and in the movies. It’s an alluring mix, and sometimes pursuing or being pursued by a faithful Christ-follower can seem, well, almost boring in comparison. The world is selling you a lie, and you’ve probably bought it in part or in full. But like JP said on Tuesday, building a relationship on the things the world values is a recipe for heartbreak, not success.\n\n#### **Hollywood’s Way to Build a Relationship**\n  \nWhen you build a relationship Hollywood’s way, here’s what you care about, starting with what you believe is the most important:  \n\n  \n1. Are they attractive? (Physical)\n  \n2. Do I feel good when I’m around them? (Emotional)\n  \n3. Do they have the personality that I want? (Psychological)\n  \n4. Do they advance my relationships and status? (Social)\n  \n5. _Optional_: Is there a deeper inner connection? (Spiritual)\n  \n  \nThis doesn’t just happen in Hollywood. Tinder, anyone? You’re always on the prowl when you live like this, looking for the hottest person you might be able to ask out or be asked out by. It’s about the other person only to the degree that they fit the ideal you’ve created in your head, but really it’s all about you, you, you.  \n  \nTest yourself on this in your next social situation, or maybe the next time you come to The Porch. What gets you interested in or excited about someone of the opposite sex? Is it how attractive they are and how good you feel when you’re around them? Or do you push pause on how attractive they are, and wait to get excited or make any decisions until you know how much they love God? There are a lot of attractive, fun people out there, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But if that’s your first filter for starting a relationship, you’re missing out on a lot of great people, and you’re building your relationship on shaky ground. Let’s flip the script and see how wisdom would have us do it.  \n\n#### **Wisdom’s Way to Build a Relationship**\n  \nNo surprise, the wise way to build a relationship is pretty much the opposite of the Hollywood model. A great relationship that lasts is built on what really matters. Here’s what you should care about, starting with the most important.  \n\n  \n1. **Spiritual** : [Is the other person a Christian](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+6%3A14&version=NIV)? Are they [following and obeying Jesus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14%3A15&version=NIV)? Do they have an [abiding relationship with Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+15%3A5&version=NIV)? The spiritual foundation has to be there first. If this isn’t there, nothing else matters. This should be the first thing that you look for when learning more about someone or spending time with them. If their relationship with Jesus isn’t obviously the most important thing about them, move on, or hold off until it is.\n  \n2. **Social** : Are they authentic and [kind in their relationships with others](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4%3A32&version=NIV)? Are they [connected in community](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+timothy+2%3A22&version=NIV)? Are [they servant-hearted](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+10%3A43-45&version=NIV)? Notice how they handle relationships, especially with people who can’t do anything to help them. How they treat other people is how they will treat you.\n  \n3. **Psychological:** Do they know who they are, and are they comfortable in their own skin? Are they being their true self? Do your personalities fit well together? Getting to know each other in a group setting can be great way to see if there’s a personality fit, and see if the other person is the same when they are around others as they are around you. Don’t obsess over “compatibility”, but do pay attention to how you are able to connect and interact.\n  \n4. **Emotional:** Are they emotionally stable, healthy, and mature? Do emotions have the proper place in the relationship? You should have positive feelings toward each other, but you should see them for what they are – [something that accompanies the relationship, but doesn’t define it](http://www.watermark.org/message/4234). You need to keep your emotions behind God’s leading, and appropriate for your level of commitment to each other. Don’t let your emotions dictate the relationship.\n  \n5. **Physical:** Are you attracted to the outside based on what’s inside? Physical attraction matters, [but less than you think](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-important-is-physical-attraction/). Having someone be your physical “type” is great, but watch out for that being an idol, and it definitely shouldn’t be the main thing you base the relationship on. And as far as getting physical goes, [don’t go too far](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-far-is-too-far/). Save it for marriage, and [look to set an example by how you pursue each other in purity](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+4%3A12&version=NIV).\n  \n  \nYou may not have the money, the fame, the looks, or whatever, but if you are a Christian [you have been given everything that you need to live a godly life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+peter+1%3A3&version=NIV). And that includes building a healthy relationship that lasts. Build your relationship on God’s Word and God’s wisdom, and no matter what happens, [it will stand the test of time](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7%3A24-27&version=NIV).  \n  \nWhat are you building your relationships on?  \n  \n-Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"2BbG36FazuKkUW2yKAYIKu"}}},"url":{"en-US":"how-to-build-a-relationship-that-lasts"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-build-a-relationship-that-lasts/"}}},

Unless you’re that rare person who marries their first boyfriend/girlfriend, you probably already have been – or will be – part of a breakup. Personally, I’ve been broken up with (ouch), I’ve been the one ending the relationship (doesn’t feel much better), and I’ve been a part of that unicorn of a breakup that felt mutual and healthy. It feels like I’ve covered a lot of the breakup bases, and now I’m glad to be married and never have to worry about breaking up again. But you might have to, so let’s talk about it.  \n  \nLike we said [last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4260), there are times when it’s clear that a dating relationship needs to end. But we didn’t dig much into the _how_ of ending the relationship – can that even go down in a way that doesn’t hurt so badly? Breakups are usually painful – after all, you’re telling someone that you don’t want to be with them, or can’t see yourself loving them in the future, and that’s a hard thing to say and to hear. But there are some principles from the Bible that you can apply to break up well. You can do this whether you’re the guy or girl in the relationship, since whoever believes the relationship needs to end is the one who should lead out in that conversation.\n\n#### **Be Wise**\n  \nNever break up alone. I don’t mean that other people need to physically be with you in that conversation (that could be awkward), but you should get plenty of wise counsel from other people as you decide how to end the relationship. Whatever plans you have, [they are much more likely to succeed with wise advice](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+15%3A22&version=NIV). You shouldn’t tell your community group after the fact that you broke up – involve them beforehand. And you should definitely [ask God for wisdom](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1%3A5&version=NIV) and pray a lot before you do anything.  \n\n#### **Be Brave**\n  \nBreaking up takes courage. You’re ending something that you worked hard at. You may be hurting someone that you care about. You’re saying things that are hard to say and hard to hear. You might be single for a long time after this. [When you’re afraid, that’s the time to trust God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+56%3A3&version=NIV) and move forward in faith, since [He will direct your paths as you trust Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+3%3A5-6&version=NIV).  \n  \nPart of being brave is having the conversation as soon as you know you need to have it. Don’t just put it off until the “right time.” There probably isn’t going to be one. The time I ended a relationship, I avoided the breakup talk for way too long because I was afraid of hurting her feelings, and I didn’t really know what to say. When it came out that I had been thinking about breaking up for a while, that hurt her even more. Be bold. Have the conversation as soon as you can after you know it needs to happen.  \n\n#### **Be Considerate**\n  \nHow would you like to be broken up with? The Golden Rule applies to breakups just like it applies to everything else – [do it the way you would appreciate having it done to you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+3%3A5-6&version=NIV). Time and place matter. Usually in private is best, in a place where you both can have some space to process. One practical suggestion is don’t drive somewhere together – that would not be a fun ride home.  \n  \nThis also means do it in person. If you’ve been in a relationship with someone, don’t dishonor them by hiding behind a text, social media message, email, phone call, or even worse by ghosting them. Just like you should ask someone out face-to-face, you should do the same when you’re breaking up.  \n\n#### **Be Grateful**\n  \nThe other person gave you the gift of their time, and you should thank them for what they invested in the relationship. Even though the relationship is ending, they probably did some things well, and you should affirm them for that and for the positive things you see in them. Don’t just do this to soften the blow; do it because [it’s what God would have you do](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+thessalonians+5%3A18&version=NIV).  \n\n#### **Be Honest**  \n\n  \nBeing honest might be one of the hardest things to do in a breakup. You might be tempted to use some tired clichés like these: “I love you, I’m just not _in_ love with you.” “You deserve someone better.” “We’re just better off as friends.” “I need some space.” “It’s for the best.” “God told me we need to break up.” And of course the classic, “It’s not you, it’s me.” Are any of those things _really_ the reason for the breakup? Most of the time they’re smoke screens for something else.  \n  \nYou should [speak the truth in a loving way](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4%3A15&version=NIV). Don’t use clichés. Don’t over-spiritualize it or just blame God (though if you’re breaking up for a reason specifically found in the Bible, be sure to tell them that). Give them enough information about how you arrived at this decision without being unnecessarily hurtful or crushing them. You should get wise counsel from other Christians on exactly what to share here. Don’t say something that might be true but would not be helpful to the conversation. Even in a breakup, you should look to [encourage the other person](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+thessalonians+5%3A11&version=NIV).  \n  \n\n#### **Be Sensitive**\n  \nDon’t be a jerk when you’re breaking up. The message that things are over is hard enough to hear; you don’t need to add to it by the way you deliver the message. [Be gentle](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+4%3A5&version=NIV). [Be kind and compassionate](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4%3A32&version=NIV). Be careful. Speak calmly. If emotions rise, deal with them in a mature way. Give the other person the room to respond with anger, sadness, or other tough emotions without getting caught up in those emotions yourself. After all, this conversation was probably more of a surprise to them than it was to you.  \n\n#### **Be Clear**\n  \nIf the relationship is over, make sure that you communicate it with crystal clarity. Don’t let being sensitive become people-pleasing, where you tell the other person what you think they want to hear. You’re not just taking a break or giving each other some space. If the relationship is done, don’t create false hope. It may feel good to say that something could change in the future, but if you don’t actually have plans for that, it’s a cruel lie. If something does change in the future, the time to talk about it is _then_, not now.  \n  \nPart of being clear in a breakup is being clear _after_ the breakup too, and that means making a clean break in the immediate aftermath. It’s usually helpful to not see or talk to each other for a while. Stand firm in your decision. Lean on your community. Pray a lot. I’ve known some couples who have gotten back together and married after breaking up, but all of them gave each other plenty of healthy space during the time they were broken up.  \n\n#### **Moving On**\n  \nWhether you were the one doing the breaking up, or the one broken up with, you shouldn’t jump right into another relationship to fix the pain of a breakup. Remember that your value and worth is not defined by whether you are dating or single – [your identity is in Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+1%3A12&version=NIV), and [God has chosen you as His own](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+2%3A9&version=NIV). Take some time to heal if that’s what you need. Think about what God taught you through the relationship. Think about the qualities in another person that should matter to you. Evaluate where you need to grow or change, and get some help in those areas. Ask God to direct your steps, whether toward eventually being in another relationship or staying single. Take it a day at a time, [focusing on God’s kingdom, and trusting that He will provide what you need when you need it.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+6%3A33&version=NIV)  \n  \nTrusting God alongside you,  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"YM0gZ9wt8IqK0GkSQkSAW"}}},"url":{"en-US":"when-its-over-how-to-break-up"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/when-its-over-how-to-break-up/"}}},

Some of you want sex so badly that you’re having it now [even though you’re not married](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-sin/). Others of you burn for sex but are a “good kid” who doesn’t have sex before marriage so you’re turning to [porn](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-i-love-porn/) and fantasy, or if you’re not doing that you’re feeling ripped off by having to “stay pure.” Still others of you are so defined by your sexual desires and orientation that they direct where you live, who your friends are, and how you present yourself to the world.  \n  \nYou may not say it, but sex is the most important thing to you, more than following God, and you can’t imagine that God could ever satisfy you like sex can. I’ll say it for you – sex is your idol, and maybe even your god. Or even if it’s not that extreme for you, your sexual desires affect you more than you’d like them to, and you’re wondering why you struggle so much with them even though you’re a Christian. Isn’t God supposed to take care of that?  \n  \nSex is a good thing and a gift from God, but like everything else in the world it was twisted by sin in [the Fall](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+3&version=NIV). The gift became more important than the Giver, and we threw out the guidebook too, looking to use sex in the way that [seemed best to us](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+14%3A12&version=NIV). Like we talked [about last Tuesday at The Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4335), as a culture, and as individuals, we have overlooked God’s clear instruction and have prioritized our preferences over truth when it comes to sex.  \n  \nThe Bible has something to say about sex, struggles, and where to find true satisfaction. Let’s dig in.\n\n#### **Truth #1 – Your eyes will never be satisfied sexually.**\n  \n_Death and destruction are never satisfied, and neither are human eyes (Proverbs 27:20)._  \n  \nWhen it comes to sex, you’ll always want more than what you have. Your eyes will never truly be satisfied by what they take in, whether it’s a person in real life or on a screen. I think we all know the feeling…the last time you looked at porn was the “last time,” until you wanted to look again, which you probably did. The last time you hooked up with that guy was the “last time,” until you saw him or another guy and did it all over again, because you forgot what it felt like to not want to.  \n  \nThe reality is that there isn’t ever a true “last time” when it comes to sexual desire and temptation. The more times you give into your sexual desires, the less you feel satisfied by what you’re doing, and more extreme you need to get to feel that same hit of pleasure. Your eyes will always want to take in more.  \n  \nThis is dangerous if you keep giving in to the desires, but it’s also [normal and common to be tempted sexually](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A13&version=NIV), so you don’t need to feel like a crazy deviant just because the desires are there. Being tempted by sin is part of being a sinful human being. The important thing is, how are you responding to those desires?  \n\n#### **Truth #2 – If you follow your eyes, your heart will never be satisfied.**\n  \n_If my heart has been led by my eyes…that would have been wicked, a sin to be judged (Job 31:7, 11)._  \n  \nMany of you have probably heard that it’s important to guard your heart. Your heart in this case represents your inner desires, will, and feelings. Guarding your heart means that [you’re careful about what you let into it](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-guard-your-heart/), because [everything that you do flows out from it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+4%3A23&version=NIV).  \n  \nIf your heart isn’t fully satisfied, it’s because you’re not guarding it well, and you’re feeding it things that don’t fully satisfy. Follow me on this – since your eyes can never be satisfied sexually, if they are leading your heart, _then your heart will never be satisfied either!_ Your heart is asking the question, “what should I want?”, and your eyes will always answer, “more!” no matter what they are looking at. It’s an endless cycle…your eyes lust, which is sin, and then your heart is led by your eyes, which is also sin. And the pattern continues. You can’t stop it on your own, no matter how hard you try. Sin will never satisfy you, and you simply don’t have the ability to fight it by yourself.  \n\n#### **Truth #3 – Your heart can only be satisfied by God.**\n  \n_[God] satisfies the longing soul, and the hungry soul he fills with good things (Psalm 107:9)._  \n  \nGod can satisfy your heart in a way that sex never can. If that sounds crazy to you, it’s a symptom of believing the lie that you are a sexual being first, and a spiritual being second. If that were the case, then something spiritual could never meet that deep sexual need. But the truth is, you are a spiritual being first, and a sexual being second. Your spirit, your soul, your inner person – those are the most important thing about you, not your sexual desires or orientation. God created us to have sexual desires, but not to be ruled or defined by them.  \n  \nThe Bible says that our [souls are immortal](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A46&version=NIV), and that God [has set eternity in our hearts](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ecclesiastes+3%3A11&version=NIV). There’s no way that an immortal soul with a heart that’s wired for eternity could ever be satisfied by something as short-lived and insignificant as sex. No – our immortal, eternal desires can only be satisfied in an immortal, eternal God! And God wants to satisfy you. He invites you to [listen to Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+55%3A2&version=NIV), [be satisfied in Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+107%3A9&version=ESV), [delight in Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+37%3A4&version=ESV), [rejoice in Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+4%3A4&version=ESV), and [receive pleasure from Him forever](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+16%3A11&version=ESV).  \n\n#### **Truth #4 – You have to keep refocusing your heart on what satisfies.** \n  \n_[S]et your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. **<sup> </sup>** Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things (Colossians 3:1-2)._  \n  \nYour heart is going to be led by something, and you have to choose what that is. If you feed your heart sexual desires through your never-satisfied eyes, then your heart will never be satisfied. But if you feed your heart what really satisfies it, then it will be satisfied!  \n  \nTo find satisfaction in God, though, you have to fight our sin-saturated world and your own sinful nature on a daily, hourly, moment-by-moment basis. Setting your heart on heavenly things is not a one-time thing, it’s an all-the-time thing. You have to [set your heart on the right path](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+23%3A19&version=NIV), because it wants to wander. You have to [pull your heart away from envying sinners](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+23%3A17&version=NIV), because it wants the false satisfaction of sin. You have to [apply your heart to understanding God’s Word](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+23%3A12&version=NIV) and [discipline yourself to be godly](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+4%3A7&version=NASB), because it will want to be lazy and apathetic. You have to intentionally think about things that are true, pure, and right, because otherwise your flesh will pull you towards things that are false, sinful, and wrong. Oh, and you shouldn’t be doing any of that alone. You need biblical community around you to help, since [sin is deceitful and you can easily get hardened by it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+3%3A13&version=NIV), and you’ll need their encouragement!  \n\n#### **Truth #5 – A satisfied heart changes everything.**\n  \n_Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it (Proverbs 4:23)._  \n  \nIf your heart is guarded from sin, focused on things that really matter, and satisfied in God, then that will be reflected in every part of your life, including your sexuality. A satisfied heart helps you see the lies of pornography, fantasy, masturbation, homosexuality, and promiscuity for what they are – empty promises that will only enslave you. When you see those sins for what they really are, and when you see God for who He really is, the choice to follow God becomes much easier. It’s still an everyday battle because our sinful nature still wants lead us astray, and because the [devil is out there trying to destroy us](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+5%3A8&version=NIV), but you can experience [true victory in Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+15%3A57&version=NIV) as you find your satisfaction in Him.  \n  \nWhere are you looking for satisfaction?  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"4YidLa9pBYwMQIUGiS6W0i"}}},"url":{"en-US":"sex-cant-satisfy-your-heart-but-god-can"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/sex-cant-satisfy-your-heart-but-god-can/"}}},

I wanted to study at a seminary and find a job at a church somewhere, and “the buckle of the Bible Belt” seemed like the right place to go, where the churches are many and the seminaries are serious.  \n  \nOther than a decent car from my dad and a few bucks from an aunt, I didn’t have much in my corner. I had no formal ministry experience, and I had zero ministry contacts. (That’s right. I moved to a city full of churches, hoping for a church job, with no church home and a network of zero church leaders in town.)  \n  \nBut my relationship with Jesus was strong. I’d been a passionate believer for a few years, had devoured my first small group experience in college, and had sponged up a few systematic theologies. I was memorizing the Bible like crazy. I wanted to travel internationally. I had ideas, and was willing to take risks. I sincerely felt I would lay down my life for Jesus if He asked me to. My faith felt gritty and real. I was a nobody on the outside and (mostly) healthy on the inside.  \n  \n**And then a few things went right.**  \n  \nI got into a competitive leadership development program at a big church (the [Watermark Residency Program](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/residency)), and then was hired there full time. I graduated with a Master’s in Christian Education. A leader took a chance on me, and I started working on the sermon team for a young adults ministry ([The Porch](http://www.theporchdallas.com/)), supporting – and, every once in a while, giving – sermons to a live audience of thousands and live-streamed to thousands more across the country.  \n  \nAt some point, something weird happened...people started respecting me. Peers asked for mentoring. Christian camps asked me to come speak. Emails came in asking for guidance. It felt good...too good. On top of all that, a woman who had both remarkable character and beauty (a rare combo, says Proverbs 31) agreed to become my wife. So we got married, honeymooned in Mexico, and bought a house for good measure.  \n  \nNow I’m 28, and I have the wife, job, house, success, safety, comfort, and opportunity of my dreams. I have a mortgage, two cars, two incomes, and a vacation planned. I’ve gained more in five years than I thought possible for a lifetime.  \n  \n**But now I’m in trouble.**  \n  \nIt’s harder for me to love heaven desperately when my arms are so full of earth. That enthusiastic, risk-it-all-for-Jesus faith I had when I moved to Dallas is being threatened by something safer, more calculated. That desire to tell people in other countries about Jesus has been replaced by a resistance to be away from the love of my wife for even one night. The readiness to sacrifice my life for the gospel been replaced by dread and fear that persecution could come to my future family. I guess you could say that as success picked up on the outside, my faith was attacked on the inside.  \n  \nI know the world loves me more at 28 than it did at 23. But I’m not sure which version I like better.  \n  \nDon’t get me wrong. I don’t think success is a sin. I don’t think my wife or my house or my job are sins (if they were, hopefully I wouldn’t have them). But to love them more than the Jesus who will long outlast them...that’s a sin of the worst kind. And that’s a new and real temptation for me.  \n  \nSo, if you are a Christian, my message to you is this: be careful what you wish for. Success may be the worst thing that could ever happen to you – not because success is wrong, but because if you aren’t careful, it will chip away your love for God and numb you to how valuable He is. [The more you love your life, the harder it is to lose your life for Jesus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+16%3A25&version=NIV).  \n  \nBy God’s grace, I love Him today. I know He’s better than anything else. I understand that chasing success is a hollow pursuit. And I know the love of Christ is better than life itself. But, if I’m honest, those things are harder for me to remember than they’ve ever been.  \n  \nBe warned. Success can kill you in two ways – it can withhold itself from you or it can give itself to you. But if you love success more than Jesus, you’re already dead.  \n  \nMy prayer for you is that you’ll stay “[poor in spirit](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5%3A3&version=NIV)” even if this life makes you rich. That you’ll prefer the love of the Father over the love of the world. And that no matter how many “wins” you may or may not get in this life, that you’ll [count it all as loss](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+3%3A8-9&version=NIV) for the sake of Christ, and lose your life over and over again in order to find it in Jesus.  \n  \nHow are you handling success?  \n  \n- Garrett\n\n"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"2Xugw7bUli2AaMcEwC2Mig"}}},"url":{"en-US":"your-success-could-be-your-downfall"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/your-success-could-be-your-downfall/"}}},

But how about what you believe about sin? Does sin matter to God? You bet it does. And if something matters to God, it should matter to you. What you believe about sin is incredibly important to your relationship with God and to your spiritual health.  \n  \nLike we talked about [last Tuesday at The Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4379), it’s easy to get amnesia about the blessings that we have in Christ – like the permanent status that Christians have before God, where [He doesn’t count our sins against us](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A19&version=NIV). We might understand it conceptually, but it’s still easy to live like that isn’t true. Believing – or living – lies about sin can hold you back from experiencing freedom and healing from sin, and it can also kill your intimacy with God. Here are four killer lies about sin that can make you its slave.\n\n#### **Lie #1: Sin isn’t that big of a deal**\n  \n_“Grace, bro! Jesus paid for it all, so now that I’m a Christian, sin isn’t a big deal, right_?” It’s a big deal because it was important enough for Jesus to die for. If you give your sin a free pass, you downgrade Christ’s sacrifice and dilute the gospel. But if you see sin for what it is – [something deserving eternal separation from God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A23&version=NIV), then your natural response to being saved from sin should be incredible gratitude towards God, and a humble attitude as you relate to other sinners.  \n  \n[You’ve been set free from being a slave to sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A18&version=NIV), but remember that sin used to be your slavemaster, and it still has some influence over you. If you’re a Christian, [sin is still at work in you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+7%3A21-22&version=NIV) even though it doesn’t define you. Believing the lie that sin isn’t a big deal can keep you from fighting sin and pursuing holiness like God wants you to. And if you [get complacent about sin, it will destroy you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+1%3A32&version=NIV). Those “white lies” you’re telling? Sin. Those casual lustful glances? Sin. That sense of prideful superiority you have? Sin. Don’t get complacent because you might not be struggling with the “big” sins anymore – keep striving to [throw off every sin that entangles you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+12%3A1&version=NIV)!  \n  \n**Application:** Do an inventory of where you might be getting complacent about sin in your life. What sins feel more “acceptable” to you? Are you justifying any persistent sin that seems innocent, respectable, or victimless? What would your community group say?  \n\n#### **Lie #2: I’m still tempted – I must be a bad Christian**\n  \n_“I’m a Christian, so why do I still want to sin? Am I even saved?”_ No matter how long you’ve been a Christian, you’re going to be tempted to sin. The Bible says that [it’s a common thing for all humans](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A13&version=NIV). The difference is that as a Christian you’re not a helpless victim to temptation anymore. You have [weapons to fight it with](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+6%3A10-17&version=NIV)! Temptation is a choice to sin, but it can’t compel you to sin. That’s a big difference! [God promises to provide a way out from temptation when you face it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A13&version=NIV). Of course, you have to actually take the way out, which isn’t always easy.  \n  \nBut take heart! There’s one word that describes Christians who are still tempted to sin: **normal**. Even [Jesus was tempted in the same ways we are, and He empathizes with us](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+4%3A15&version=NIV) because He knows what it’s like to be tempted (though He didn’t sin). You should [ask God to lead you away from temptation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+6%3A13&version=NIV), and you should [flee the things](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+timothy+2%3A22&version=NIV) that you know will tempt you, but don’t believe the lie that you’re a “bad Christian” just because you’re still tempted by sin.  \n  \n**Application:** Think about the temptations you most commonly face. Do you feel guilty for being tempted? Where are you most likely to be tempted? How can you fight or flee from those temptations? What is God’s way out for you in those moments of temptation?  \n\n#### **Lie #3: God is angry at me because I still sin**\n  \n_“God expects me to not sin anymore. And every time I do, He gets angrier with me.”_ I’ve got good news for you, Christian – God isn’t mad at you! The Bible says that we have [peace with God through Jesus](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+5%3A1&version=NIV). If you are in Christ, [God doesn’t count your sins against you anymore](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A19&version=NIV). [He’s angry at the godlessness and](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+1%3A18&version=NIV) wickedness of those who are not in Christ, but none of that anger is directed towards you. The Bible says that [God is slow to anger and abounding in love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+103%3A8&version=NIV) toward those who fear Him, and [He doesn’t treat us like our sins deserve](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+103%3A10&version=NIV). Instead [He has compassion on us, remembering that we are weak](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+103%3A13-14&version=NIV).  \n  \nGod hates sin, but He doesn’t hate you because you sin. You don’t have to be afraid of His anger, and you can [approach Him with confidence, knowing that He will extend mercy and grace to you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+4%3A16&version=NIV). Run to God when you sin, not away from Him. He is [faithful to forgive you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+1%3A9&version=NIV) when you ask Him!  \n  \n**Application:** Examine your own thoughts about God. Do you think He’s mad at you? If so, why? If not, why not? Do you feel confident in approaching God to confess sin and ask for forgiveness? Ask God to [help you understand His great love for you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+3%3A17-19&version=NIV)!  \n\n#### **Lie #4: There’s no way out of my sin**\n  \n_“Freedom feels impossible. I’ve been stuck in this sin so long as a Christian, and I can’t do anything about it.”_ When you feel hopelessly stuck in your sin, humbled by your own inability to fight it, that’s actually a good place to be. The first step to recovery in [re:generation](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/regeneration-recovery) (Watermark’s Christ-centered recovery ministry) is to admit that you are powerless over your sin, and that you can’t manage sin on your own. And that’s where God comes in! [He humbles those who are prideful, but He lifts up those who are humble](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+4%3A6&version=NIV).  \n  \nRead this [parable that Jesus told](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+18%3A9-14&version=NIV) about a Pharisee and a tax collector – God doesn’t want you to come to Him thinking that you have it all together. He wants you to come to Him asking Him for mercy and help in your time of need. And [He loves to give it to you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=micah+7%3A18&version=NIV)! [Mercy beats out judgment](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+2%3A13&version=NIV) when it comes to God’s children.  \n  \nBut He doesn’t just stop at being merciful – He also wants to restore and heal you! It often isn’t a quick process, but God is in the business of changing lives, and He wants to change yours too. He’s more powerful than your sin, and He will bring regeneration and freedom to your life as you turn to Him. Like the [prodigal son found out](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+15%3A11-27&version=NIV), hope is never lost – there is always a way home.  \n  \n**Application:** You can’t fight sin on your own. Have you fully confessed your sin to God and others? Do you have others in your life who are praying for you and supporting you? Have you taken [radical measures](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5%3A29-30&version=NIV) to flee sin? Have you considered a Christ-centered recovery program like [re:generation](http://www.regenerationrecovery.org/)? Ask God what He would have you do today to turn away from sin and run to Him.  \n  \nDon't believe the lies!  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1oDmRIXSJSWimmK02mQq4o"}}},"url":{"en-US":"4-killer-lies-we-believe-about-sin"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/4-killer-lies-we-believe-about-sin/"}}},

Not the money kind, but the life kind. Some people have to have it; others hate it. Like we talked about [at the Porch on Tuesday](http://www.watermark.org/message/4388), the Christian life is all about change, where we become more like Jesus as God does His work in our lives and we faithfully follow Him. That change happens through being in a relationship with God, having new thinking based on God’s Word, and being in community with other Christians who help each other grow.  \n  \nChange can be tricky. Sometimes you make a lot of progress, and other times it can feel like one step forward, two steps back. And other times, it’s hard to even know _what_ even needs to be changed. A little introspection would do you well – here are seven areas to consider in your life that might need to change for you to grow in your faith. These are all areas that are incredibly influential in your life, either positively or negatively!  \n  \nI’m not going to tell you what to think or what you specifically need to change – that’s between you, God, and your community. But I’d like to give you a few questions to ask yourself and each other, and some verses for you to look up. Do what we talked about on Tuesday: ask God to give you the right thinking in each of these areas based on the Bible, and get your community’s feedback too.\n\n#### **1. What you want most**\n  \n_Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart. (Psalm 37:4)_  \n  \n**Questions:** What do you want more than anything else? Is God the most important thing to you? Do your priorities reflect God’s priorities? What desires do you most actively try to satisfy? Do your actions match your stated priorities? What do you think would make you the happiest?  \n  \n**Verses:** [Psalm 1:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+1%3A1-3&version=NIV), [Psalm 119:92-93](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+119%3A92-93&version=NIV), [Psalm 62:5-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+62%3A5-8&version=NIV), [Psalm 19:7-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+19%3A7-14&version=NIV), [Matthew 6:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+6%3A33&version=NIV)  \n\n#### **2. What you think about most**\n  \n_Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. (Philippians 4:8)_  \n  \n**Questions:** Is your thought life pure? Do you fantasize about anything? Are you consumed by worldly things? What kinds of thoughts most easily and most often come to your mind?  \n  \n**Verses:** [Colossians 3:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A2&version=NIV), [Romans 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+12%3A2&version=NIV), [Romans 8:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A5-6&version=NIV), [Matthew 5:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5%3A28&version=NIV), [Psalm 119:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+119%3A9&version=NIV)  \n\n#### **3. How you use your money**\n  \n_Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth…. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. (Matthew 6:19-21)_  \n  \n**Questions:** Are you stewarding money wisely or just spending it? Are you anxious about money? Do you want to get rich? Do you think having more money would make you happier?  \n  \n**Verses:** [Matthew 6:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+6%3A24&version=NIV), [1 Timothy 6:6-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+6%3A6-10&version=NIV), [Proverbs 23:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+23%3A4-5&version=NIV), [Hebrews 13:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+13%3A5&version=NIV), [Ecclesiastes 5:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+5%3A1%600&version=NIV)  \n\n#### **4. What you do with your free time**\n  \n_Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. (Ephesians 5:15-16)_  \n  \n**Questions:** Are you wasting your time or investing it wisely? Does your down time consistently lead you to sin? Do you struggle with laziness? Do you feel aimless, or are you on mission?  \n  \n**Verses:** [Psalm 90:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+90%3A12&version=NIV), [Proverbs 24:30-34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+24%3A30-34&version=NIV), [James 1:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1%3A22&version=NIV), [James 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+4%3A17&version=NIV), [Colossians 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A17&version=NIV)  \n\n#### **5. Who you spend time with**\n  \n_The righteous choose their friends carefully, but the way of the wicked leads them astray. (Proverbs 12:26)_  \n  \n**Questions:** Are your friends wise or foolish by God’s definition? Are you dating in a godly way? Do you influence your friends positively, and do they do the same for you? Are you making an impact for Christ on those around you?  \n  \n**Verses:** [Proverbs 13:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+13%3A20&version=NIV), [Ecclesiastes 4:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ecclesiastes+4%3A9-10&version=NIV), [Proverbs 17:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+17%3A17&version=NIV), [Proverbs 27:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+27%3A17&version=NIV), [2 Timothy 2:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+timothy+2%3A22&version=NIV)  \n\n#### **6. Who and what you admire**\n  \n_Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. (Hebrews 13:7)_  \n  \n**Questions:** Who do you want to be like? Who are your heroes? Who do you respect?  \n  \n**Verses:** [1 Peter 2:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+2%3A17&version=NIV), [1 Thessalonians 5:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+thessalonians+5%3A12-13&version=NIV), [1 Peter 3:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+3%3A15&version=NIV)  \n\n#### **7. What you laugh at**\n  \n_Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. (Ephesians 5:4)_  \n  \n**Questions:** What do you think is funny? Is your sense of humor clean or crude? What are you entertained by? Would you be ashamed of anyone finding out what you laugh at? Is what you watch / listen to clean?  \n  \n**Verses:** [Psalm 101:2-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+101%3A2-3&version=NIV), [Isaiah 5:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isaiah+5%3A20&version=NIV), [Proverbs 17:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+17%3A22&version=NIV), [Ephesians 5:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5%3A11&version=NIV)  \n  \nDon’t get overwhelmed – you can’t change all of these areas at once. It’s a process! And really, you aren’t even the one who can change your heart – that’s God’s job. If you are a Christian, God is at work in you, and He is going to [keep working on you for your good](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+1%3A6&version=NIV). Your job is to [love and obey Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14%3A15&version=NIV).  \n  \nWhere do you most need God’s help to change?  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"1CHqjDmtMMaquUOug0CyqK"}}},"url":{"en-US":"want-to-change-look-at-these-7-areas-of-your-life"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/want-to-change-look-at-these-7-areas-of-your-life/"}}},

That’s all he ever really ate – beans and rice. A very nice meal, on rare occasions, might include a chicken leg, and sometimes he might find (steal) a banana.  \n  \nI’ve said “I’m hungry” many times – maybe waiting to be seated at a hostess stand, or before a big meal with family. My kids often say “I’m starving!” when they’ve had to go a few hours without more than a snack. But that little boy’s limit of hunger was much higher than mine or my children.  \n  \nOver the break I got to take my family on vacation. One morning as we left a hotel with central heating and air conditioning and drove to the airport after a week that included Legoland, Disneyland, and fun in San Francisco, I hit a different limit. I heard those same words coming from the back seat: “I’m hungry!” Followed by, “Daddy, my stomach hurts I’m so hungry!” I was fed up with complaining. “Why is it raining?” “Traffic is so bad.” “How far is the airport?” “I’m so hungry!”  \n  \n  \n\n#### **Your preferences can rob you of paradise**\n  \nI think Monica and I are pretty good parents, but we’ve done something terribly wrong. We are much like thermostats, changing the temperature to ensure our children’s comfort. We’ve engaged when they were cold, hot, hungry, and generally whenever they are uncomfortable. We’ve constantly given our kids choices on what they can eat. We often cater to their preferences.  \n  \nHere's the problem with that: I believe that often our preferences rob us of paradise. We were not meant to do whatever we want. In fact, when Paul describes those who are enemies of the gospel, he says “[their god is their stomach](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+3%3A19&version=NIV)…”(Philippians 3:19). Meaning, they eat whatever they are hungry for. They feed their appetites. Said otherwise, they follow their preferences. As I’ve spent the last 10 years studying a generation of young adults, I believe this marks us. We long to satisfy our every craving. We constantly seek to fix anything making us uncomfortable. This has caused us to be weak-minded, with no real resolve to fight sin. We are more like tourists than soldiers. We’ve embraced earthly citizenship rather than our calling to be [strangers and aliens](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+2%3A11&version=NASB).  \n  \nImagine with me two scenarios. One is a trip to the airport with three kids in the back talking over each other expressing every single thing that might not be perfect. Their words are void of gratitude, even after a loving father has lavished on them experiences for their enjoyment. They point out that it’s cold and rainy, traffic is bad, the car is stuffy with luggage and every seat occupied, and that granola bar they had 30 minutes ago did not fill them. In fact, it left them “starving!”  \n  \nNow, for another scenario, imagine a car filled with children giving thanks that they have a car, and that the traffic allows them to see the sights, as they trust that their daddy knows when they should eat. They have preferences that are not being met, but they know their father is a great provider of everything he believes they need, and they trust him.  \n  \nWhich scenario is more like paradise? When our preferences for something turn to discontentment, paradise is farther out of reach. However, when we see that our unmet preferences make us stronger and more dependent on Jesus, Paradise is closer to us.  \n  \n  \n\n#### **You must learn to depend on Jesus**\n  \n[Jesus calls us to fast](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+6%3A16-18&version=NIV). That is to go without food. Why would Jesus want us to go without something that our body needs? I believe there are [several lessons to learn in fasting](http://www.theporchdallas.com/fasting/). One of them is learning that we need Jesus more than food. Another lesson is that we don’t have to follow our cravings. We can build resolve to fight the cravings of our flesh. Through sanctification we are learning to trust God’s Spirit over the desires of our flesh. We don’t have to be slaves to our preferences. As Paul says, \"[I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+4%3A12&version=NIV)...” (Philippians 4:12).  \n  \nHow can we “learn” this secret without ever actually being in want, or hungry? By hungry there, I don’t mean how I feel while waiting for my table at my favorite restaurant. I’m more referring to a hunger like what the boy in Haiti felt. It is a hunger than many of us may never know in the normal course of our lives. However, unlike that boy, we can willingly choose this hunger through fasting in order to realize that we need Jesus more than food, and to realize that we don’t have to follow our every craving.  \n  \n  \n\n#### **Join the revolution!**\n  \nYou don't have to do whatever you want. In fact, it is not good to do whatever you want. People who do whatever they want become dysfunctional. They are selfish. Some of them are the most depressed and ungrateful people I've met. It is good to use your life for the purposes that God intends. [We should seek to do whatever He wants](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+6%3A33&version=NIV). As we look to start a New Year Revolution, we are recruiting soldiers. Not weak-minded people who need to feed their every desire, but real fighters who demonstrate victory over the battles of sin in their lives. They resist the urge to sin and seek to please their Commanding Officer, [not getting entangled in the affairs of this world](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+timothy+2%3A4&version=NIV). Is that you? If not, we are also training soldiers, and we’d love to help you get there. Come start a revolution with us!  \n  \n  \n  \n- JP"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"5H4sU82VbiwwWiq4eAMYKY"}}},"url":{"en-US":"your-preferences-can-rob-you-of-paradise"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/your-preferences-can-rob-you-of-paradise/"}}},

It was not covered largely by the media, but that does not downplay its importance. It is something you should know about, and certainly something you should care about. Hundreds of thousands gathered to march, advocating for the rights of men and women alike, advocating for the rights of those who might not ever have the chance to develop the vocal chords it takes to do so for themselves.\n\n#### **What is the pro-life movement?** \n  \nIt is the movement that champions life at every stage of existence. From the embryo to the end, pro-lifers believe that life has inherent dignity and value.  \n  \n\n#### **Why should you care?**\n  \nThere are a lot of reasons you should care.  \n  \n**Primarily** , because you are alive because your mom chose not to have an abortion. If you were born after 1973, your mother had the legal right to end your life in the womb, and she chose not to. You should care because though you have surely inconvenienced your mom throughout the course of your existence, the thought of you didn’t move her to prevent the labors and pains you would bring about.  \n  \n**Secondly** (or maybe firstly), you should care because God cares. If you are reading this and you do not know God, or even more, if you do not believe in God, don’t ignore what I am going to say. Every human on earth past, every human on earth present, and every embryo currently in utero was made in the Image of God. This means that all people are uniquely created with purpose.  \n  \nEvery person has the potential to reflect the character of God and be His ambassador of love and truth to the world. _This means that whether you believe in God or not, you were created with qualities and characteristics that mirror His own._ Though we are all created with touches of His character and a God-ordained purpose, we do not all live in it. (See also the men and women who are wicked, unhappy, wealthy and depressed, purposeless, lost, etc.) However, your response to God, or lack thereof, does not undermine the fact that you have undeniable rights and unarguable value.  \n  \n**Thirdly** , because though many of our fellow humans disagree, there is overwhelming philosophical and scientific evidence that human life begins at conception. This, my friends, means that human life begins the moment his sperm meets her egg.  \n  \nHere is a great way to understand the science and have the conversation. Not to convince your friends, but rather to give them something to think about. The following is borrowed from Scott Klusendorf, a leading apologist for life. Using the acronym SLED, you can be equipped to show that there is nothing that suggests that a life inside the womb, at any stage, has less value than a life outside. This is not a conclusive argument, but it’s a really good start.  \n\n#### **<u>S: Size</u>**\n  \nIs a short person less valuable than a tall person? Why then would the size of the human in the womb determine its value? True, embryos are smaller than newborns and adults, but why is that relevant? Do we really want to say that large people are more valuable than small ones? Men are generally larger than women, but that doesn’t mean they deserve more rights. Size doesn’t equal value.  \n\n#### **<u>L: Level of Development</u>**\n  \nIs an infant less valuable than a 2-year-old? How about a 4-year-old who can’t read versus a 40-year-old? True, embryos and fetuses are less developed than you and I. But again, why is this relevant? Four-year-old girls are less developed than 14-year-old ones. Should older children have more rights than their younger siblings?  \n\n#### **<u>E: Environment</u>**\n  \nIs someone from South Dakota less valuable than someone from Texas? Is someone living in the Congan jungle less valuable than someone living in Beverly Hills? Where you are has no bearing on who you are. Does your value change when you cross the street or roll over in bed? If not, how can a journey of eight inches down the birth-canal suddenly change the essential nature of the unborn from non-human to human? If the unborn are not already valuable human beings, merely changing their location can’t make them so.  \n\n#### **<u>D: Degree of Dependence </u>**\n  \nIs an infant, totally dependent on its parents’ care and provision, less valuable than a 12-year-old who can feed and clothe themselves? Is someone with a broken ankle and reliant on crutches less valuable than an Olympic track athlete? If self-sustaining viability bestows human value, then all those who depend on insulin or kidney medication are not valuable and we may kill them. In short, although humans differ immensely with respect to talents, accomplishments, and degrees of development, they are nonetheless equal (and valuable) because they all have the same human nature.  \n  \nThe answer to those questions is “no”. Therefore, one can believe that a single cell, complete with the entire genetic code to create a baby, then a boy, then a grown man, is indeed a life, worthy of living and worthy of protection.  \n  \nFor a more in-depth and eloquent argument, see:  \n  \n[http://prolifetraining.com/resources/five-bad-ways/](http://prolifetraining.com/resources/five-bad-ways/)  \n  \n\n#### **How can you get in the game?**\n  \n**First** , Christian, you can be just that. A follower-of-Christ. Know first that you are fully loved by the One who _gives_ you worth. Then, in response to the fullness of love that you are shown, love others unapologetically. Remember this order though.  \n  \nYour own ability to love others, especially those different from you, especially those who think you’re ridiculous, will run out, leaving you feeling ashamed and disappointed that you could not muster enough to supernaturally love them. Don’t project this shame or disappointment on God either. He looks down on you with love still, with compassion, not mad that you in your finite state couldn’t produce His supernatural love. He looks down and mourns the fact that you did not allow the Spirit in you to lead and guide you, therefore forsaking the joy and peace and love that would have been yours as a result. The Scriptures do not joke when they say:  \n\n  \n- “Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and _are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy”_ (1 Peter 1:8-9)\n  \n- _“The prospect of the righteous is joy,_ but the hopes of the wicked come to nothing” (Proverbs 10:28)\n  \n- “How blessed is the man who has made the Lord his trust” (Psalm 40:4)\n  \n- “Do not be wise in your own eyes, fear the Lord and turn away from evil._It will be healing to your body and refreshment to your bones.” (Proverbs 3:7)_\n  \n- Jesus says, _“I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly” -_ John 10:10\n  \n  \nThere is a theme to observe here – joy, blessing, refreshment, peace, and _life_ follow a person who is in right relationship with God.  \n  \nIt is said that politics is downstream of culture, meaning that when the culture changes, so will our politics. So don’t fear that you can’t argue before the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. In fact, rejoice, because I doubt any of us could argue sufficiently. Yet, love unapologetically. Serve your coworkers, your neighbors and your family, be bold in conversations, put rocks in people’s shoe. Be quick to ask for forgiveness; humble yourself often. Know God, be honest with God, know the promises of His word and the depths of His love. The transformation in your life will start here. And when the Church begins to stand out like the Church was intended to, the world will respond. The church is the hope of the world. One cannot ignore the power of the Body’s love and ministry. The people will see your love and want to know your God. _Politics will change as culture will change, because the people will change._   \n  \n**Second** , you can engage culture at every turn. Be conversant, be winsome, be first and foremost humble and loving. Do not shy away from co-workers or friends who disagree with you. These are the very people you should pray for and initiate with. We are on the right side of this argument. Though the mainstream media and culture quite proudly disagrees, if something is true, then no amount of scrutiny or screaming will prove it otherwise. Check out this [RTRQ](http://realtruthrealquick.com/how-to-talk-about-abortion/) for a 5-minute video on how to talk about abortion.  \n  \n**Third** , be generous with your time and money. Invest in groups that are actively advocating for life. Share your story. Volunteer at a pregnancy resource center. Ask the Lord what He wants you to do. To read the story of others or share your own: [https://standforlife.org/](https://standforlife.org/)  \n  \n**Fourth** , pray. For men and women in this nation and around the world, that there would be a revival in their hearts. For the church, that there would be revival in their pews. Remember that God wants to know you, and He wants you to know Him. He seeks the transformation of your heart, the transformation of “his” heart, “her\" heart and even “their\" heart. God does not need us to pass legislation to end abortion, though that is absolutely a worthy goal. He does aim to use the Church to reach humanity. He cares infinitely about every single life, and rest assured that He WILL do something about it one day.  \n  \nIn the meantime, let’s get busy. Let’s have the conversation.  \n  \nIs abortion part of your story? We love you and would love to know you and care for you.

How is my life going to change? What’s our country going to look like? Will I still have the same job? Will I finally meet my future spouse? I think you might not be asking one of the most important questions: how am I going to change spiritually this year? It’s a question that only God can fully answer, but you play a part in answering it too. And trust me – you want to get this one right.  \n  \nThis question isn’t just about you though. Like we [talked about on Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4423), we want to start a revolution, not just inspire you to make resolutions. Resolutions can be good, and they might make a better you, but revolutions (the right kind, at least) make a better world. And revolutions are started by people who first resolve to make a change in their own life and then the world around them. Here are three areas to examine as you think about what might need to change in your life this year.\n\n#### **Who’s in charge of your life**\n  \nAsk yourself: _Is there any area of my life where I am not completely following Jesus?_  \n  \n JP spent a lot of time talking about this[on Tuesday](http://www.watermark.org/message/4423). One of Christianity’s paradoxes is that for you to be completely free, you need to be under the right person’s authority. And that person isn’t you. Like JP said, Christian victory comes through surrender, freedom comes from submission, and your faulty pursuits of freedom will actually [lead you to captivity](http://www.theporchdallas.com/sexual-sin-will-make-you-its-slave/). True freedom (_great blog from JP on that topic if you click the link!_) cannot come from following anyone or anything but Jesus.  \n  \nSome of you, or people you know, might resist the idea of following Jesus because you don’t believe that He is actually the Son of God. If that’s you, we’d love to talk! There are some really good answers here. For your own reading, you can also check out the books “[More than a Carpenter](https://www.amazon.com/More-Than-Carpenter-Josh-McDowell-ebook/dp/B002OFAY6O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1484949726&sr=8-1&keywords=more+than+a+carpenter)” or “[The Case for Christ](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Christ-Faith-Compilation-ebook/dp/B0039W58QM/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1484949764&sr=8-5&keywords=the+case+for+christ)”.  \n  \nA lot of you would probably say that you follow Jesus, but the million-dollar question is _how, and_ _in what areas?_ Are there any areas where you might give lip service to Jesus but not do what He says? Jesus’s own words were, “[If you love me, keep my commands](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A15&version=NIV)” (John 14:15). Are you following Jesus 100% in areas like purity, money, relationships, work, serving, confession, and prayer? Like _really_ following? You won’t be perfect, but that’s not the point. The point is faithfully responding to a loving Savior who knows what’s best for you.  \n  \nWrite down your answer to the question above, and share it with someone close to you. If there’s a consistent hurt, habit, or hang-up you’d like to work through because you haven’t been following Jesus in certain areas, come check out [re:generation](http://www.watermark.org/events/20) to experience Christ-centered recovery!  \n\n#### **What you’re feeding yourself**\n  \nAsk yourself: _Am I feeding my mind, body, and spirit what’s healthy or unhealthy?_  \n  \nWhat you let in determines what comes out, and I don’t just mean food. Your intake determines your output in a lot of areas. On the physical side, we probably all know that one person who could eat at Raising Cane’s every day and not gain a pound, but I’m guessing it’s not you. The Bible affirms that [physical discipline has some value](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+4%3A8&version=NIV), and taking care of your body honors God. I’m not saying you have to do the Whole 30 or join that CrossFit box, but you’re better off making healthy decisions where your body is concerned.  \n  \nMore important, though, is whether you’re feeding your mind and spirit a steady diet of God’s Word and truth. What are you more likely to invest an hour in: reading the Bible, watching Netflix, or scrolling through social media? A few years ago a guy I trust told me that the #1 thing most people need to change in order to get in the Bible more and change spiritually is to watch less TV. Add social media to that list, and I agree. Save yourself the comparison, jealousy, and wasted time, and choose to feed yourself something that will nourish your soul. If you’re looking for a way to start, check out [jointhejourney.com](http://www.jointhejourney.com/) for a daily bite of truth, or jump in Watermark’s [Equipped Disciple](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/equipped-disciple) class to take a big step in growing your relationship with God.  \n\n#### **Who you’re spending time with**\n  \nAsk yourself: _Are the people with the greatest influence on my life following Jesus 100%?_  \n  \n The people you spend time with will change your life one way or the other, either for good or bad. You might think you have a choice in the matter – “I can hang out with this crowd and not get dragged down!” – but that’s naïve. The Bible says that [bad company corrupts good character](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+15%3A33-34&version=NIV), and you aren’t the exception to that rule. [You will be influenced](http://www.theporchdallas.com/whos-influencing-you-the-choice-is-yours/) by the people you spend time with and do life with. If you want to make the right resolutions and start the right kind of revolution, make sure it’s with the right people – those who are following Christ with everything they’ve got.  \n  \nIf that sounds like a total drag, please let us help change your mind! Not all Christians are boring, and not all alternatives to the bars and clubs mean you stay home on the weekend. I’d say we have more fun than anyone, and it’s the kind of fun that doesn’t come along with a side dish of regrets. Check out the Porch’s [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/theporchdallas/?fref=ts) or [app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-porch/id908788854?mt=8) to hear about all the things coming up! We have an entire team of young adults who dream up and put on events you’d actually want to come to.  \n  \nBeyond just the weekend scene though, you need Christian brothers and sisters who know you deeply, love you unconditionally, and encourage you to follow Jesus every day. At Watermark, we call these [community groups](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/community). If you’ve never been in one, check out Open Community Group after the Porch on Tuesday! Or if you’re a Watermark member or looking to join, check out [Singles GroupLink](http://www.watermark.org/events/1067). At both places you’ll meet other young adults just like you who are looking to connect with other Christians to follow Jesus with.  \n  \nIf you want to start a revolution, it starts with you. What do you want to change in 2017?  \n  \n- Luke  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

Do you want to leave the job you have now? In American Christianity there are several areas of our lives that are so culturally acceptable, we are unable to see how far off we are from God's desires for us. For example, materialism: very few Americans are content with just food, shelter and clothing (1 Timothy 6:6-8). Another example is work. Like we talked about [at the Porch on Tuesday](http://www.watermark.org/message/4445), so many of us are chasing our passions in and out of multiple jobs with no regard for how we are representing Christ in doing so.  \n\n##### **We are work, and work is good**\n  \nWhen God made the universe, He worked (Genesis 2:2). God made us in His image (Genesis 1:27), which – among other things – means that God made us to work. God gave man work to do when the world was still perfect (Genesis 2:15). Notice that this is before sin entered the world in Genesis 3. Work is not a result of sin! When sin entered the world, work became difficult. Work itself wasn't cursed, but the ground man worked was. Now the broken world wars against our work.  \n  \nLooking forward, we will work in heaven, but there will be no curse on it (Revelation 22:3). We will work and not grow weary – our work will be a joy. For those of you who looked up that verse and didn’t see the word “work” anywhere . . . keep reading.  \n  \nIf work existed before sin, and exists in eternity where there is no sin, and we were made to bear the image of God, then a part of our work is to reveal God's kingdom here. We should try to display God's loving character in our work as much as we can. We should be our coworkers' favorite colleague in the way we help them, work hard, and exceed expectations.  \n\n##### **What if your job is hard?**\n  \nThe Bible addresses difficult work environments in several passages like Ephesians 6, Colossians 3, and 1 Peter 2. Why does the Bible give so much instruction to “slaves” and “masters”? This was in many ways the employee/employer relationship of that time ([Read more on that here](https://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-slavery.html)). While this wasn't the racial slavery in our country's tragic history, it was often a harsh working environment. These verses remove our excuse not to excel in a difficult work environment. I saw this quote the other day and it resonated with me: “When did we start believing that God wants to send us to safe places to do easy things?”  \n  \nWhile there are lots of biblical commands for how slaves (employees) should act in harsh work environments, there is no instruction for them to ever leave. So, when should we leave a job?  \n  \nMost often we leave for a better opportunity. Better usually means \"more money\" or \"more freedom\". I'm afraid when we are face-to-face with Jesus and He asks, \"why did you leave that mission field I had you in?\", We will have no better response than \"because I could make more money, Jesus.\"  \n\n##### **So, should you leave your job?**\n  \nYour job is a primary means of you advancing the Kingdom of God. God placed you there on purpose, so give careful consideration to what He might be doing there before you leave. Here are some questions to ask if you’re thinking about leaving your job. (_Also check out another Porch blog post, “_[_What to do if you hate your job_](http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-to-do-if-you-hate-your-job/)_”_.)  \n\n  \n- Would I leave my job better than I found it? (Do my coworkers agree?)\n  \n- Has my work ethic made the teachings of Jesus more attractive? (Titus 2:10)\n  \n- Have I worked in a way that silences my critics? (1 Peter 2:15)\n  \n- Do I want to follow my passions elsewhere?\n  \n- What skill do I hope to develop in a new opportunity that I can’t develop here?\n  \n- Have I prayed, read Scripture, and sought the advice of wise godly people?\n  \n- Do I trust that my reward from the Lord for working for Him is better than any promotion or reward I'll receive here? (Colossians 3:24)\n  \n- Am I being called to a new mission field, or am I simply leaving an uncomfortable environment?\n  \n- How does my leaving advance the kingdom?\n  \n  \nDon’t just answer those questions by yourself. If you go through them already wanting to leave your job, you’re likely to answer them in a way that justifies the decision you want to make. Instead, follow the advice of Proverbs 15:22 and get counsel from other wise people who know you and who know God’s Word.  \n\n##### **Don’t “Follow your passions”**\n  \nIf you were born between 1980 and 2000, you have been pretty much brainwashed to \"follow your passions\". The term hardly existed in print before 1980, and then it skyrocketed in use with the birth of Millennials.  \n  \nYour great-grandfather most likely never questioned his passions. He probably didn't give much consideration to what he wanted to do. He didn't take Strengthsfinder, Myers-Briggs, DISC, or have any idea if he was a \"lion, otter, beaver, or retriever\". He did the work that was in front of him. He most likely did the work that his dad did, and what needed to be done to survive. And he was probably much happier than you in doing so.  \n  \nI know we've evolved, and now we can match personalities to specific jobs. These advancements, however, have not made us happier. We have lower job satisfaction than ever. We jump between jobs more than ever. We stay at jobs for less time than ever. And we'd be hard-pressed to compare our work ethic to that of our ancestors. We are not getting better at this, and I believe it is simply because we've moved away from God's values. We have embraced cultural norms over biblical mandates.  \n\n##### **Work is worship**\n  \nRemember the reference to Revelation 22:3 above? It says “No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him.” (NIV) But wait – what does that say about work?  \n  \nThe Greek word translated as “serve” in that verse also means “to worship” or “to serve for hire” . . . that sounds a lot like work, doesn’t it! It’s a very similar idea to the Hebrew word “adovah” that’s used to describe work in Genesis 2:15. Adovah means to labor, to work, to worship, _and_ to serve. We compartmentalize each of these actions, but God doesn't. He receives your work as worship! It is the service you will be doing much of in heaven. It is also an opportunity for you to display heaven to others today.  \n  \n- JP & Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"5ZZxmLG1pYGC8YCgyw6wiU"}}},"url":{"en-US":"should-you-leave-your-job"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/should-you-leave-your-job/"}}},

Not in a romantic way – they might be a friend or coworker, or maybe a relative. They’re always happy to see you. Like almost obnoxiously happy to see you. When they ask, “how are you?” you have to choke back the standard “I’m great, how are you?” and give a real answer, because you know they mean it. They want to know. They care, and they have time to listen. They have a “there you are” kind of attitude, as if you’re just the person they wanted to see. They’re so sincere compared to most people you run across, it might even feel a bit awkward. Deep down, you’re impressed by them. Their sincerity feels good. But you also wonder – how in the world do they do it?  \n  \nWe also know another kind of person. The person that’s special to them, is them. They’re not mean to you, but you’re definitely not who they really care about. They have a “here I am” attitude, and you’d be lucky to get them to really see you. They might be on their phone a lot while you’re talking, or scanning the crowd behind you to see who they can talk to next. It’s the same small talk as usual, and the conversation somehow always keeps coming back to them. When it’s over, you’re left wondering – what did we just talk about?  \n  \nHere’s the question you need to be asking: which kind of person are you?  \n  \n**Selfishness robs you of happiness**  \n  \nLike we talked about [on Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4461), narcissism and self-centeredness define us in a lot of ways. Give yourself a little test: What percentage of your thoughts in the last five hours have been about yourself? How much do you care about how you look, or what other people think of you, or your own performance? How much do you battle insecurity? How many great questions have you asked others and actually listened to? How much do you show other people how important they are?  \n  \nWe think that looking out for #1 will make us happy. The ironic thing is, the exact opposite is true. Instead of giving something to us, selfishness robs from us. It takes away things like contentment and compassion, and it steals our opportunity to be truly great.  \n  \n**A revolutionary greatness**  \n  \nWe need to redefine greatness. We need a revolution in our selfishness. We need a revolution in our relationships with others. You need to become a “there you are” kind of person, not a “here I am” kind of person. It will change your life profoundly. But how can you do it? The answer isn’t just to try harder.  \n  \nTo be great, be a servant, following Jesus’ example of sacrificial service and love.  \n  \nIn Mark 10:43-45, Jesus tells His followers “…[W]hoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”  \n  \nTo be great, be humble, imitating the mindset that Jesus had.  \n  \nIn Philippians 2:2-5, Paul says “Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus…”  \n  \nThis won’t be easy. Selfishness dies hard. Hebrews 12:1-2 says “…let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith…”  \n  \nTo be great, look to Jesus. Focus your attention on Him, not yourself. Jesus is the One who redefines greatness and gives you the ability to achieve it (John 15:5).

(Hebrews 11:1,6)_  \n  \n  \n  \nReasonable faith. Blind faith. Step of faith. Leap of faith. Shaky faith. Dead faith. Confident faith. Everyone has a faith. What’s yours like?  \n  \nWait, _everyone_ has a faith? Even the atheist, agnostic, or skeptic? They may not know it or admit it, but they do. An atheist has faith that atheism is true. An agnostic has faith that agnosticism is true. A skeptic…well, you get it. They may not claim a _religion_, but they have a _faith_. Each of them has a worldview – a mental model of reality – that tries to explain the big questions about life, like who we are, where we came from, why we’re here, how we should live, and where we’re going. Everyone’s ideas and attitudes about the world, themselves, and life in general come from their worldview. And everyone believes (has faith) that their worldview is true.  \n  \nThe question is, what’s worth believing? What’s worth having faith in?  \n  \nThe thing about religions and worldviews is that they aren’t just about faith – they are also about _facts_. All worldviews make claims about what’s true (facts), and those claims can be analyzed. We can evaluate which worldview has solid evidence for its conclusions (beliefs), and which worldview’s conclusions are most reasonable based on reality. We can see whether faith is reasonable or not.  \n  \nBut you might be thinking – do “reasonable” and “faith” really belong in the same sentence? Aren’t they opposites? The opposite of faith isn’t reason, it’s _unbelief_. A faith is reasonable if its worldview and supporting facts can be shown to be reasonable.  \n  \n_Quick timeout. Still with me? Is all this talk about worldviews making your eyes glassy? We’re going to dig in a little more, then pull out some applications for your life. Stick it out._  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Christian Apologetics 101**\n  \nThere’s no way that a short blog post can fully defend the Christian worldview, but I want to give you a few points that show how the Christian faith makes logical sense. There’s a lot of evidence and reasoning backing these up that I can’t include for the sake of space, but there are more resources at the bottom of this post that you can dig into for details.  \n  \n_Arguments for the existence of God_  \n  \nIf someone says to you, “why should I believe that God exists? That’s crazy! Give me one good reason for the existence of God.” Here are four good ones. God is the best explanation for:  \n\n  \n1. _Why anything at all exists rather than nothing_. Where did everything come from?\n  \n2. _How the universe came to be_. When did the universe get started, and how?\n  \n3. _The fine-tuning of the universe for intelligent life_. Why does the universe and earth seem so well suited to human flourishing?\n  \n4. _The existence of objective moral values and duties_. How can we say that something – for example, torturing babies for fun – is always wrong?\n  \n  \nThe best answer to these questions is because God set it up that way. That isn’t just a “drop the mic” statement though – a lot of non-Christians disagree with that. But I believe that the facts point to God as the best explanation for reality. Check them out for yourself by digging into those resources that I mentioned. If something is true, no amount of scrutiny can affect it.  \n  \n_12 Steps to show that Christianity is Logical and the Bible is True_  \n  \nThe first book I ever read about Christian apologetics was called “[I Don’t Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist](https://www.amazon.com/Enough-Faith-Atheist-Foreword-Limbaugh-ebook/dp/B0029RJ7D8/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1489766202&sr=1-1&keywords=i+don%27t+have+enough+faith+to+be+an+atheist).” Catchy title, but it also laid out and defended 12 logical steps to show that biblical Christianity is reasonable. They are:  \n\n  \n1. The truth about reality can be known.\n  \n2. The opposite of true is false (two contradicting things can’t be true at the same time).\n  \n3. It is true that the theistic God exists. The evidence for this is the beginning of the universe, the design of the universe and of life, and the moral law.\n  \n4. If God exists, then supernatural miracles are possible.\n  \n5. Miracles can be used to confirm a message from God.\n  \n6. The New Testament is historically reliable. The evidence for this is early, authentic, eyewitness testimony of historical events that was accurately recorded and copied.\n  \n7. The New Testament says that Jesus claimed to be God.\n  \n8. Jesus’ claim to be God was confirmed by His fulfillment of prophecy, His sinless life, His miracles, and His prediction and accomplishment of His resurrection.\n  \n9. Therefore, Jesus is God.\n  \n10. Whatever Jesus (who is God) teaches is true.\n  \n11. Jesus taught that the Bible is the Word of God.\n  \n12. Therefore, it is true that the Bible is the Word of God, Christianity is true, and anything opposed to it is false.\n  \n  \nEach of those points took a few chapters to explain and defend. Together, they build a logical argument that makes sense. And if they’re true, then being a Christian is the most reasonable thing you could possibly do!  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Apologetics Can’t Prove Your Faith**\n  \n_These [tests] have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. (1 Peter 1:7)_  \n  \nPoints like the ones above can show that Christian faith in general is reasonable, but no logical argument can prove that your personal faith exists. You could defend facts about Christianity without trusting in Jesus yourself. What shows you have a real faith isn’t how well you can lay out a rational argument for God – it’s how much you trust God when hard times come. Faith is proven when it’s tested, and your faith develops when you exercise trust in God.  \n  \nYour response to whatever you’re going through – temptation, a breakup, job loss, depression, tragedy, and other tough situations – shows what kind of faith you really have. That kind of faith can’t be proven just with logic and apologetics; it must be proven with trust. A “Jesus, no matter what happens, I’m going to follow you” kind of trust. And the more you follow Jesus and trust Him, the more your faith grows. It’s like a muscle – it gets stronger when you use it.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **God Wants You to Trust Him**\n  \nThe other day I was walking by a playground at Watermark. A little girl was standing on the edge of a platform a few feet off the ground, and her dad was right in front of her with his arms held out. “Jump, honey!” She hesitated. “I promise I’ll catch you!” No movement. “You can trust Daddy.” Finally, she jumped! And of course, her daddy caught her, hugged her, and put her safely on the ground.  \n  \nIf she had said, “I trust you Daddy” but didn’t jump, would you believe that she really trusted him? Or if she had listed off all the facts of the situation – how big, strong, coordinated, and close her daddy was, but still didn’t move? She had the facts straight. The evidence was clear. It was perfectly reasonable that she would be caught. But she didn’t prove it until she leapt into her daddy’s arms.  \n  \n[God is asking you to trust Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+3%3A5-6&version=NIV). Right now, in whatever you’re going through. It’s probably going to feel uncomfortable or scary. But the facts are there – He’s trustworthy.

When he trusted Christ, Amelia Earhart was still flying, the game Monopoly first hit store shelves, and Babe Ruth hit his final three home runs before retiring.  \n  \nLast Tuesday at the Porch ([watch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4490) it here), we had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear this historic national hero share in person about his experience during the Pearl Harbor attacks, and more importantly, about the Savior who changed his life.  \n  \nGet a 60-year jump on your faith. Here are five pieces of advice from a man who’s built a revolutionary legacy of faith and finishing well.  \n  \n**Advice #1: Get acquainted with Jesus**  \n  \nThe best advice that Jim said he’d ever received, or could ever give anyone, is to get acquainted with Jesus Christ, who will prove to be the greatest Friend you’ll ever have.  \n  \n_Ask yourself:_ Have you started a relationship with Jesus by trusting in Him for your salvation?

[Equipped Disciple](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/equipped-disciple).  \n  \n**Advice #2: Find your completeness in God, not circumstances**  \n  \nJim said that Christ provides resources that your circumstances can’t touch. Jesus provides a completeness in our lives that nothing else can. God has set eternity in our hearts (Ecclesiastes 3:11), so only something eternal can satisfy us. And God promises that when we delight ourselves in Him, He will give us the desires of our hearts (Psalm 37:4).  \n  \n_Ask yourself:_ Do you feel complete?

Jesus promises that kind of peace to His followers (John 14:27). God tells us that He is a very present help in times of trouble (Psalm 46:1). You don’t have to worry – instead, trust God, who works everything out for the good of those who love Him (Romans 8:28).  \n  \n_Ask yourself:_ What do you worry about? Does anxiety own you?

He said that the best definition of love he’d found is _voluntarily giving yourself up to another_ _person_. (Jesus said this too, in John 15:13). Their marriage was based on living out that principle. They also allowed each other to develop and exercise their unique strengths and gifts.  \n  \n_Ask yourself:_ How would you define love – and is it the right definition?

Later in life, he trusted Christ after receiving a gospel tract from a US veteran who had been a Japanese POW (you can [read Fuchida-san's story here](https://www.biblebelievers.com/fuchida1.html)).

Google has more than 40 million hits on a “life hacks” search, and you can find creative shortcuts and ideas on everything from how to fold a fitted sheet (we’re still not sure that’s possible) to using Doritos to start a fire.  \n  \nA life hack is a simple and clever tip or technique for doing a common task more easily and efficiently. Did you know that the Bible also has a life hack for something you do every day? This one is way better than knowing the ten uses for that toilet paper roll. It’s _how to fight temptation – the choices you make every single day to sin or not sin._  \n  \nWe’ve written before about fighting temptation (_check out_ [_this blog post_](http://www.theporchdallas.com/5-steps-to-fight-temptation-and-win/) _on five steps to fight temptation and win_), but it’s important enough to keep emphasizing it. [Like Adam talked about last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4539), fighting temptation is one of the most important parts of the Christian life. Learning how to deal with temptation can be the difference between becoming who God wants you to be, or becoming a mere shadow of it.  \n  \nThe Bible’s perspective on temptation can be summarized in one verse: **<sup> “</sup>** No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.” (1 Corinthians 10:13, NIV).\n\n##### **Temptation is Unavoidable**\n  \n_“No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind.”_  \n  \n You are going to be tempted. Fact. Maybe you’re even being tempted right now_._ It would be nice if there was an off-switch for temptation, but you’re not going to find it on this side of heaven. You might think that you’re a bad Christian for being tempted (_that’s a lie_ [_we talked about in this blog post_](http://www.theporchdallas.com/4-killer-lies-we-believe-about-sin/)), but that’s not the case. Your temptations might be unique to you, depending on the sin you find most attractive, but the fact that you’re tempted is not unique.  \n  \nIt doesn’t matter if you’re tempted by pride, sex, anxiety, materialism, porn, greed, lying, people-pleasing, or whatever kind of sin. As a Christian, every day is a battle. Take a deep breath – you’re in the same boat as literally every other human on the planet. You’re normal. The hits are going to keep coming, no matter who you are.  \n\n##### **No Temptation is Unbearable**\n  \n_“And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.”_  \n  \nThe hits _will_ keep coming, but here’s the deal – none of them is a guaranteed knockout punch. God Himself said so! No temptation that you’ll face is more than you can bear. You will _never_ be forced to give in to sin. It is _always_ a choice. That’s both comforting and sobering. Comforting in that the temptation you face won’t be more than you can resist, but sobering in that you can’t pass the blame on to anyone or anything else. You can’t blame culture, your friends, your parents, the way that person dressed, or the picture that popped up on your Instagram feed. And you definitely can’t blame God – the choice to sin is yours alone (check out James 1:13-15 for more on this). But God is faithful. The reason that you’ll never be tempted beyond what you can bear is because God always provides a way out before you break.  \n\n##### **No Temptation is Unescapable**\n  \n_“But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.”_  \n  \n This is where the two-part life hack comes in. Part one is knowing that every time you’re tempted, God provides escape hatches. Find them! Part two is actually taking the way out! But here’s where this life hack is different from most: it isn’t always easy. Let’s be honest – a lot of times when you’re tempted, you’ve blown right past the early escape hatches without even thinking. By the time you snap to your senses, it might be too late. A lot of times that realization comes after you’ve sinned. Don’t blame God for not providing an easy way out at the last minute, when you ignored the escape hatches He gave you along the way!  \n  \nHere’s a scenario: if you’re in bed with your boyfriend / girlfriend, about to go all the way, it might not feel like there’s a way out in that moment (_hint: here it is – STOP, and leave! It will feel incredibly hard, but it’s still a way out_). It feels like there’s no way out now, because you ignored all the ways out earlier. You could have avoided alone time at night by setting up healthy boundaries in your relationship. You could have told your community group where you were going and asked for real-time accountability for when you’d leave. You could have moved to separate couches the moment that you felt sexual desire stirring. You could have stopped and left after that first kiss. The list goes on. All of those were opportunities that God gave you to escape that sin! But you kept going. The way out is still there, but now the escape hatch is barely cracked, and you’re the one who’s been closing it.  \n  \n_For some great thoughts on how to take a crowbar to the escape hatch and throw it wide open against the temptations of lust, porn, and sex, check out_ [_ANTHEM: Strategies for Fighting Lust_](http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/anthem-strategies-for-fighting-lust)_._  \n\n##### **Start Playing Offense Against Temptation, Not Just Defense**\n  \nHere’s a bonus life hack: you don’t just have to play defense against temptation. You can also play offense! God offers tools that can help keep you from getting to that place of intense temptation in the first place. Memorize these verses and start applying them to your life:  \n\n  \n- Submit yourself to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you (James 4:7)\n  \n- Walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfill your flesh’s desires (Galatians 5:16)\n  \n- Choose your friends – and the person you date – carefully (Proverbs 12:26)\n  \n- Make no provisions to gratify the desires of your flesh (Romans 13:14)\n  \n- Flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness (2 Timothy 2:22)\n  \n- Flee from sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18)\n  \n- Put on the armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-18)\n  \n- Memorize God’s Word (Psalm 119:11)\n  \n- Confess your sins (1 John 1:9)\n  \n- Pray (Luke 22:40)\n  \n  \nMake it your mission to find – and take – as many early escape hatches as you can.

(1 Peter 1:1-2)_  \n  \nGod chose you. Did you know that? If you’re a Christian, you’ve been chosen by God to be made holy (sanctified) and obedient. Like we talked about [last Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4550), this choosing by God gives us a [hope for life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+1%3A3&version=NIV) and the promise of an [incredible eternal inheritance](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+1%3A4&version=NIV). But what about that “holy and obedient” thing? Does being made holy and obedient to God sound like He’s giving you your freedom or taking it from you?  \n  \nI believe it’s the most incredible kind of freedom there is. Let me explain.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **What a concussion taught me**\n  \nA few years ago, some friends and I visited one of my college buddies in Houston. Monica and I were the last ones to arrive, and as we pulled up, my buddies were in the street playing football. Excited, I jumped out of the car and ran to the huddle. I looked at my friend playing quarterback and said, “hit me on a post route.” I went up to the line of scrimmage and at “hut”, I sprinted down the street. He launched the ball, and I jumped up in the air and turned around to catch it. That was stupid. My momentum had me flying backwards over asphalt. The first thing to hit the ground was my back, and then my neck acted like a slingshot to throw my head into the street. I was out cold.  \n  \nI woke up with a huddle of friends around me. They took me to the hospital. I was not well. I didn’t know where I was, and I kept asking the same questions over and over. It turns out I had a concussion. I rested for a few days and recovered. But what happened next, I didn’t see coming.  \n  \nMy favorite candy is chocolate. I love chocolate. As I ate my first piece of chocolate after the concussion, though, I spat it out. “It’s gone bad”, I thought. I tried some more. It was disgusting. Coffee was another love of mine. But when I took a sip, it was bitter. Some of the things I used to love were no longer enjoyable! Why? Because my tastes had changed.  \n  \nTo me, I think this helps explain what it’s like to be chosen to by God to be made holy and obedient. When you become a Christian, God starts to change your tastes. The sin that you used to enjoy and indulge in without guilt or shame, now comes with conviction. There’s a new influence in your life – the Holy Spirit! [Part of His role is to convict you of sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+16%3A8&version=NASB) and point you toward obedience to Christ.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **A new perspective on porn**\n  \nThis happened to me with porn. I used to be addicted to porn. I used to love it and watch it whenever I could. But when I became a Christian, I got a new perspective on porn. I’m not saying that I didn’t still want to look it, but I got a greater awareness that it was deadly and would bring death to my life. Once upon a time, I only enjoyed it. But God’s Word showed me that it’s a killer wearing an attractive mask. And through God’s work in my life to make me obedient, I don’t look at porn any more.  \n  \nPart of me still loves porn ([I wrote about that here](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-i-love-porn/)). But because I have new God-given tastes and desires, I can write about [how to overcome a pornography addiction](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-overcome-a-pornography-addiction/) and [how to hate pornography](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-hate-pornography/). God has given me the freedom to obey Him instead of my sinful desires, and He helps me obey Him through the power of the Holy Spirit. [I’m not a slave to my sin anymore – I’m a slave to righteousness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A17-18&version=NIV).  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Freedom comes from obedience**\n  \nIf what I just described doesn’t sound like freedom to you – if you still want the “freedom” to do whatever you want – you might not have ever experienced the work of the Holy Spirit in your own life. I can call obedience, “freedom,” because I’m following the only One who can truly set me free. God hasn’t set me free <u>to</u> sin; He’s set me free <u>from</u> sin! And that new perspective is something that only He can provide. If you don’t have it, you should be worried for your soul.  \n  \nThe good news is, God doesn’t require you to work at being obedient for Him to save you. The work that God requires is to believe in Jesus, the One whom He sent (John 6:29). And when you believe, God saves you and starts to change you. You start to love Him more and more. Because you love Him, you become more obedient to His commands (John 14:15). As you obey Him, you experience the abundant life that He came to give you (John 10:10). And that’s the best kind of freedom there is.  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n(with help from Luke)"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"12zwrd48GwSEikoc88iyCm"}}},"url":{"en-US":"freedomcomesfromobedience"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/freedomcomesfromobedience/"}}},

A lot of young adults don’t. Take a few seconds and answer this: What’s your reason for existing?  \n  \nHow did you land at your answer? And are you sure it’s the right one? Better check with God.  \n  \nLots of things fight for the chance to define your purpose. Your job will tell you that your purpose is to make money and enjoy success. The American Dream will tell you that it’s to reach a comfortable status quo. Your apathy will tell you it’s to just take it easy and let life come to you. Your relationship (or the absence of one) will tell you it’s to have someone who makes you happy. Your depression will tell you that you have no purpose. The weekend will tell you that it’s to do whatever feels good. But what really is your purpose? And how will you know when you’ve found it? Like I said…better check with God, [who gives everything its purpose](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+11%3A36&version=NIV). As we talked about [Tuesday at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4585), 1 Peter has a lot to say about what your purpose is.\n\n#### **1. Your purpose is to grow in your faith**\n  \n_Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation… (1 Peter 2:2)_  \n  \n“Grow up!” You may be used to hearing that as an insult, but not in this case. It’s what God wants for you! Part of your purpose as a Christian (literally, a “little Christ”) is to become more like Jesus. And that happens as you grow in your faith. It’s a [process that God started when He saved you, and He will ultimately see it through to completion](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+1%3A6&version=NIV). But you do have a part to play in your growth.  \n  \nWe all start as spiritual babies, no matter whether you trusted Christ at 5 years old or 35. And like a baby needs nutrition to grow, your soul needs spiritual nutrition to grow in Christ. But as a young adult, no one’s going to force you to eat – you have to feed yourself!  \n  \nTo grow spiritually, you need to consume the things that will make your faith grow. [Fill your mind with God’s Word](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+1%3A2&version=NIV). [Focus your mind on things with eternal significance](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A2&version=NIV). [Apply your heart to learn from godly instruction](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+23%3A12&version=NIV). As your faith grows, [use it to serve others, not be served](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+10%3A43-45&version=NIV). A baby is needy, but a healthy young adult shouldn’t be. Don’t just grow in knowledge, but also in [obedience](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7%3A24-27&version=NIV) and in [action](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+1%3A22&version=NIV). You might not be able to tell right away that you’re growing, but it will happen as you [discipline yourself to be more godly](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy+4%3A7&version=NIV).  \n  \nAs you feed your soul the good stuff, you also need to starve it of the things that hurt it. Porn. Pride. Anxiety. Codependency. Materialism. Premarital sex. These and other poisonous sins will stunt your growth! Do whatever it takes to strip them from your life. If you’d like some help with that, check out [re:Generation Recovery](http://www.watermark.org/events/20), a discipleship program that helps people overcome hurts, habits, and hang-ups by following Jesus.  \n\n#### **2. Your purpose is to connect with others who are following Jesus**\n  \n_You also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood… (1 Peter 2:5a)_  \n  \nBeing connected with other Christians is at the core of Christianity. To use Peter’s words, you’re a “living stone”, meant to be connected with other “living stones”, resting on the foundation of the Cornerstone, which is Jesus.  \n  \nWhat does that actually mean? Be a part of a local church. Be under godly leadership. Be deeply connected with other Christians who are following Jesus as their only foundation. Enjoy fellowship and accountability. You’re missing out on your purpose if you’re not a part of a local gathering of believers (a church) who are committed to supporting one another and helping each other live out their purpose.  \n  \nTo do that, it might mean that you need to [change your playground and your playmates](http://www.theporchdallas.com/changing-playground-and-playmates/), removing [unhealthy influences from your life](http://www.theporchdallas.com/whos-influencing-you-the-choice-is-yours/) and focusing on [joining a healthy community](http://www.theporchdallas.com/whats-the-big-deal-about-community/). The other stones in your spiritual house need to build you up, not drag you down.  \n  \nChristianity is a team sport. You can’t play it without teammates! Live out your purpose by going all in with other Christians. It doesn’t mean you have to completely [shut non-Christian people out of your life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+5%3A9-10&version=NIV)! It means that you need to build your life around other followers of Jesus.  \n\n#### **3. Your purpose is to tell people about Jesus**\n  \n_But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. (1 Peter 2:9)_  \n  \nThis might be the clearest point that Peter makes in these verses: your purpose is to tell others about Jesus! You’ve been chosen by God to talk about how He brought you from darkness into light, from death to life. You were made to share the gospel! You’re [God’s ambassador to the world](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A20&version=NIV), telling other people how wonderful it is to follow Him.  \n  \nBut if you were made for it, why does it feel so hard sometimes? It might feel awkward to start a spiritual conversation. You might not know how. You might feel like a hypocrite for sharing about a perfect Savior when your life isn’t so perfect.  \n  \nThe good news is, you don’t need to be perfect! You just need to be able to share the story of what God has done in your life and tell others about the way they can experience the same thing. Start here: “Do you have a faith?” Ask them about theirs, and tell them about yours.  \n  \nIf you’d like to get better at this, come join us for an [Unashamed weekend](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/unashamed) sometime! We’ll train you in how to share the gospel in a way that’s not awkward, hard, or hypocritical. You’ll get plenty of opportunities to share the gospel with people you meet, while hanging out with a group of other young adults who are committed to doing the same thing. It’s one of the best things we get to do.  \n  \nIt would be tragic if you spent your young adult years missing out on your purpose. God’s told you what it is – will you live it out?  \n  \n- Luke  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

(1 Peter 2:11)_  \n  \nYou’re at war. Sound dramatic? It’s true. Every day, you’re in a battle for your soul. The opponent? Your sinful desires. Their weapons are many and their strategies are powerful. In this fight, there’s no truce, compromise, or surrender. You must kill sin, or sin will kill you. What’s your battle plan?  \n  \nLike we talked about [Tuesday at The Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4596), you’re not home yet! Heaven is where you can let down your guard, since [there will be no sin there](https://www.gotquestions.org/heaven-sin.html). But until then, while you’re living on earth, you need to be alert and sober-minded. Your enemy, Satan, is prowling around like a roaring lion looking for lunch (1 Peter 5:8). He’s throwing lies at you left and right. Your job is to resist him, standing firm in your faith (1 Peter 5:9).  \n\n#### **Not _planning_ to sin, or planning to _not_ sin?**\n  \nHow do you resist the devil? How do you abstain from the sinful desires that are waging war against your soul? It sure isn’t by wishful thinking or by pretending that there’s no problem. It isn’t by hoping that sin won’t grab you. You can’t just not _plan_ to sin; you must plan to _not_ sin!  \n  \nLet that sink in. The fact that you aren’t necessarily planning to sin isn’t going to help you in the heat of the battle – for example, you might think, “well I’m not _planning_ on looking at porn” but that won’t help you fight the temptation when it hits you like a sledgehammer. That’s letting your desires determine the plan. You need to plan to _not_ _sin_, more like “I know that the temptation to look at porn is going to hit me hard. I may not know when, but it’s coming. I have defenses in place to resist that temptation whenever it shows up.” That’s letting the plan determine how you will respond to the desires. That’s making choices that make it harder to sin. That’s waging war against your sinful desires.  \n  \nYou’ve probably heard it before, and it applies here too: failing to plan is planning to fail.  \n  \nThis matters in so many areas! It affects your personal purity – how will you fight your desire to lust, look at porn, or masturbate? It affects your dating relationships – how will you fight your desire to have sex, or idolize your partner, or lament your singleness? It affects your money and spending habits – how will you fight your desire to chase wealth, buy the latest everything, or be defined by your stuff? It affects your friendships – how will you fight your desire to fit in, to compromise, or to keep quiet about your faith? Just to name a few.  \n\n#### **Create your plan to fight sin**\n  \nYour plan to fight sin won’t just come together by itself. You need to be purposeful and intentional in how you put it together. Here are some ideas to get you started:  \n\n  \n1. **Prioritize time with Jesus.** If you’re not doing this and growing in your relationship with Jesus, drawing strength from Him, no plan will ultimately help you. He can satisfy your soul in a way that no other desire comes even close to.\n  \n2. **Get wise counsel**. Don’t fool yourself into thinking you can handle this alone. Involve your community group in this entire process! Dig into the Bible together to get God’s counsel.\n  \n3. **Be brutally honest about where you’re weak.** This is not the time for sugar-coating or false optimism. Identify and call out where you’re most likely to give in to sinful desires. This might be a long list, and that’s OK.\n  \n4. **Put up the strongest barriers and defenses against sin that you can.** Protect yourself! Do whatever it takes to make it harder to sin. Read Matthew 5:29-30. Is that iPhone a gateway to sin? Hello, Nokia.\n  \n5. **Decide in advance what you’re going to do when temptation hits.** “When I’m tempted to \\<whatever your desire is\\>, I will respond by \\<action steps\\>.” Planning a specific response makes it much more likely that you’ll actually respond that way in the moment.\n  \n6. **Communicate your priorities and decisions.** Let your community group know what your plan is. If you’re hanging with friends who might lead you into temptation, stand up for yourself and don’t be afraid to tell them what your boundaries are.\n  \n7. **Reach out for accountability in real-time, not after the fact.** The best time for accountability is when you actually need it – in the middle of the fight! Just giving your group a recap on your struggles from the past week won’t cut it. Reach out for their help as soon as temptation strikes. Pray together. Share Scripture. Be there for each other.\n  \n8. **Reflect on and readjust your response to temptation.** How did you do at fighting sin? What can you do differently? If you blew it, confess and repent. If your plan didn’t work, make it better. If you don’t know how, reach out. Then, get back at it – another temptation is around the corner.\n  \n  \nPraise God that we aren’t defined by our sin! His grace forgives us when our plan explodes and we give into those sinful desires. God’s grace also “teaches us to say ‘No’ to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age” (Titus 2:12). Be a good student of God’s grace, and let it teach you to fight sin with everything you’ve got!  \n  \n- Luke  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

Do do the things that make you smarter, that make you better, that bring you joy, that bring you peace. For example, don’t feed your mind things that compound the lies you already believe about your body, your relationship status, or your life. Do spend time cultivating the fruit of the Spirit in your life and investing in healthy relationships with other Christians.  \n  \n\n\n##### **The Fallen Mind and the Aggressive World**\n  \nI used the word “lie” intentionally. The near-tragic reality is that the thought most likely first in our minds – or at least deepest in our minds – is a lie. We tend to have a default setting that tips south towards the untrue. We’ll call it “the fallen mind.” The fallen mind is coupled nicely with what we’ll call “the aggressive world”.  \n  \nDo you consider yourself someone who believes the Scriptures are true? Well, consider what Paul wrote in Ephesians 6:12 – _“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.”_  \n  \nAgain, we’ll call it “the aggressive world,” which is easier to remember than “the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” This means that you are being quite strategically attacked by a force, by powers who have everything but your good in mind. You must be alert, for “_Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.”_ (1 Peter 5:8)  \n  \nIt’s not surprising, the abundance of lies. People make money off of them. Or at least they make money off of partial truths and managed information. And, as a rule, people will continue to do and make whatever makes them money, whatever the cost. 1 Timothy 6:10 goes as far as to say the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil, it causes wandering from the faith, and brings many griefs. Sounds about right.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Consider Your Time and the Longings of Your Heart**\n  \nMy goal is twofold. First – to have you consider how you spend your time. Second – to have you long for an enriched heart.  \n  \nThink of the last movie you saw that made you long for the friend, family, or partner you may not have. Think of the last advertisement that made you wish you had \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Think of the last song you listened to, or article you skimmed online…the list goes on. I’ll raise you ten and have you think of the last Instagram you saw – did it make you wish you had a different closet or body? Did it make you wish you were better at lighting and editing candid shots? Did it make you wish \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_? How real were those moments, scenes, or lyrics?  \n  \nThe world needs more men and women who dream, who create, who learn, who think, who search and question. The world is already full of so many who know too much about the Kardashians, Sportcenter, the Oscar red carpet, and video games. I am under no illusion that just because you might be reading Desiring God articles that you haven’t already spent more than your fair share of time on Facebook, Elle, ESPN, and the like (I am obviously writing from experience.)  \n  \nBut more than just curious thinkers, eager readers, learners, or adventurers, the world needs men and women of conviction. The world needs bold, anchored-in-truth men. The world needs secure, assured and unafraid women.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **What are You Feeding Yourself?**\n  \nFor a moment, let’s view time as food. Time spent is food eaten. What you spend your time doing, which is to say, what you eat, either makes you stronger or weaker. Not always immediately, but without a doubt over time. There are certainly moments at the table, fridge, or pantry when your decision has immediate effects either positively or negatively, but the overarching truth is that what you consistently eat has far-reaching consequences for both the near-future and the far-future.  \n  \nThis illustration could go on, but I will make the connection for you here: If you consistently spend your time aimlessly scrolling (“eating cereal”), it will not make you a more fit, healthy, interesting, engaging, thoughtful person, friend, husband, wife etc. In fact, it will do the opposite.  \n  \nI want you to consider what you are feeding yourself.  \n  \nYou may be a regular guy or girl by your own definition, you may even _be_ regular relative to the “accomplished” “intelligent” person at your office or from college. However, you alone have the capacity and absolute responsibility to live and work out every day you are given. Meaning, _you_ are the only reason you are or are not who you want to be. And don’t worry, I am not about to get all self-help on you. I merely want you to thoughtfully consider _everything_ you _choose_ to do. Emphasis on _everything_ and _choose_ is intentional.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Do What is Good For Your Soul**\n  \nIt’s not hard. Or at least, it shouldn’t be. The truth is easy to find if you're looking in the right place (see: the Bible), but it can still be hard to believe. And once believed, the truth can be even harder to remember and put into practice. You can thank “the fallen (forgetful) mind” for that. Consider it a war – consider it a war for you.  \n  \nHowever hard it is, it can be simple: do what is good for your soul. I would never recommend listening entirely to your feelings, but they can be a helpful gauge in determining whether or not something is creating spiritual, emotional, or physical health or sickness. Simply put, do things that are good for your soul. Be curious about, and spend time on, things that make you better. Listen to music that inspires you, that lifts your spirits, that makes you think. Read books that teach you something, that tell stories worth knowing, that introduce you to people who left the world different than they found it. Better yet, read the Book that holds the words of God himself. Research a culture, people group, or moment in history you know nothing about. Spend your time discovering more than who-broke-what-sports-record and what-she-did-wore-ate today.  \n  \nTruly, think about the time you spent today or this week on your phone scrolling. Then, don’t beat yourself up, but take note of a few things you wish you would have done, learned or seen instead. At the very least, take note of the reality that the same never-ending feed will be available tomorrow, and tomorrow you will still run the risk of finding yourself unchanged and increasingly discontent. Don’t hear me say sharing life, photos, and fun moments on social platforms is bad. That would be unfair and untrue. Hear me saying share, celebrate, “like” away, but don’t waste the moments given to you by wishing for something else.  \n  \nHere’s to curiosity. Here’s to being committed that our generation will not be totally lost to our phones, the media, and the lies told by those who want our money and don’t care about our minds and hearts.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Where Should You Start?**\n  \nI submit to you the words of King David.  \n  \nGo outside.  \n  \n_“The heavens are telling of the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.” (Psalm 19:1-2)_  \n  \nRead God’s Word, and know His way.  \n  \n_“The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul.”_  \n  \n _“The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.”_  \n  \n _“The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart.”_  \n  \n _“ The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.”_  \n  \n _“The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever.”_  \n  \n _“The decrees of the Lord are firm, and all of them are righteous.”_  \n  \n _“They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold;they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the honey comb.By them your servant is warned; in keeping them there is great reward.”_   \n  \n_(Psalm 19:7-11)_  \n  \nRefreshment? Wisdom? Joy? Sweeter than honey? More precious than gold?  \n  \nNeed more ideas? Neither do I. Just start somewhere.  \n  \n- Kirby  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

When I hear it, I picture a tired UFC fighter in the Octagon tapping out as he winces in pain. But submission is something we are all called to. It's a normal part of our lives. It is a daily practice for any Christian. If you've been a Christian for long, you know that you are to submit your life to Christ. There is, however, also clear instruction that we are to submit to every human authority _(see_ [_1 Peter 2_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+2&version=NIV)_)_.  \n  \nThis authority includes governments, police officers, bosses, and well, any human authority. Submission starts by understanding that you are not in charge. Take a deep breath and read that again and let it sink in. You. Are. Not. In. Charge. No matter how high you climb on any ladder, there will still be someone over you, for the rest of your life. You can stop trying to think of the exception – there isn’t one. Boards rule over CEOs, and the government rules over the self-employed. Every human is subject to authority. And all authority is instituted by God. One implication of this is that you should pay taxes fairly.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **All human authority is corrupt**\n  \nWhat about corrupt authority? Because every human is a sinner, every human authority is sinful in some way. Therefore, every human authority is corrupt at least in part. That means someone with the purest of motives still has an ego or a selfish ambition that could get in the way at times. If you are in a position of authority over others, please consider how your own sin nature gets in the way of your effective leadership.  \n  \nNow that we've established that all human authority is sinful, we can understand that submission to human authority is not a fair requirement. You will be asked to do things that are not fair. You will be asked to do pointless tasks that take hours and don't make sense. You will be asked to prioritize work over other things that feel more important to you. You will be asked to come in on the weekends, change the rows to columns, change the font and color, and redo the project. Sometimes others will be promoted over you when they cheat. Sometimes your boss won't like you for no logical reason. This is all very unfair. But if you expect it, you won't be blindsided when it happens. And it will happen.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **What about rebelling under unfair authority?**\n  \nThese unfair situations are incredible opportunities to show Whose authority you are really under. As a follower of Christ, you are directly under God, Who tells you to submit to every human authority as an act of worship to Him. He says He will reward you for being faithful in these unfair situations. This is where a lot of faith and patience comes in. These moments are great opportunities to trust Him.  \n  \nWhat about when you are asked to sin by a human authority? That's easy – don't sin. Remember you are ultimately under God's authority – you must obey God rather than men (Acts 5:29). However, HOW you avoid sin really matters. Sometimes I think we are waiting for that moment to really stand up to corrupt authority in a dramatic way. Calm down – they are simply sinners being sinners. Make sure you are the most excellent example of an employee. Communicate clearly what you are unwilling to do and why, but also communicate clearly what you are willing to do. \"I will be the best at anything you ask me to do. I'll come in early and stay late. I'll work with excellence, exceeding your expectations. I cannot, however, do that...(dress like that, go to strip clubs, get drunk, cheat, lie, etc.)”  \n  \nPeople often ask, “what about our forefathers who came to America in rebellion against British authority?” “What about Bonhoeffer who sought to kill Hitler?” “What about Martin Luther who rebelled against the Roman Catholic Church?” Were they wrong? Yes, in part, because all of them were also sinners. God used their imperfect rebellion, and He was honored by the portion of their rebellion that came from faith. Most of our motives are mixed. Some of their motives were probably pure and God-honoring, and some probably weren’t. The Proverbs say that “all a person’s ways seem pure to them, but motives are weighed by the Lord.” (Proverbs 16:2)  \n  \n  \n\n##### **How you should respond to authority**\n  \nBut let's get back to you. You are not in charge. You are subject to someone over you. You should obey the laws fully – even the ones you don't like. And when you don't obey them, you should pay fines responsibly, not trying to get out of what you owe. You should work hard under the authority over you, exceeding expectations and being respectable. [If you have to leave your job](http://www.theporchdallas.com/should-you-leave-your-job/), leave respectfully and with honor. You should not slander or speak poorly about anyone in authority over you. Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, and honor the government (1 Peter 2:17).  \n  \n- JP"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"2MHHku3nmwQioQI4wySSAI"}}},"url":{"en-US":"you-are-not-in-charge-get-used-to-it"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/you-are-not-in-charge-get-used-to-it/"}}},

Gloria Steinem, a spokeswoman for the feminist movement in the 1960s, said “we are becoming the men we wanted to marry.” What a devastating statement and tragic suggestion. Many of us would agree that most of the conversations surrounding gender rights, the feminist movement, equal pay, etc. are controversial, to say the least.  \n  \nWell, the Bible is no stranger to controversy. I submit to you now, 1 Peter 3, and a topic more crucial now than ever to understand, believe and live out. By the time Peter gets to the third chapter in his first letter, he’s already called us to submit to _all_ human authority, not shying away from hot topics (see Nero and last week’s blog). You’d think he would take a break, but then comes 1 Peter 3:1-7. Peter calls the men and women of the early church to a radical kind of living in relationship to one another. In chapter three, that relationship is marriage. He calls men and women alike to follow, to pursue true beauty, and to lead.\n\n##### **Submission in Dating**\n  \nMany of the women converted in the early church were still married to nonbelievers. These women had found for the first time, freedom, value, and honor in Christ remained married to men who had not yet trust Christ. In verses 1 and 2, Peter calls them to remain married and faithful; he calls them to be a living testimony of God’s grace to their husbands. Not an easy task – especially for a woman with few rights in that day and age.  \n  \nMore than that, though, Peter is teaching a valuable principle to those who are single and searching. The principle for women is to choose to follow men who are already following He whom is worth following. Simply put: Date the guys who are pursuing Christ.  \n  \nSubmission in dating looks like a man and a woman _both_ fully submitting first _to Christ_. Peter calls women to submit to _their own husbands_. In short, he’s saying submit as a wife to your own husband alone, an important note for women who are not yet married. Don’t submit as a wife to your boyfriend, to someone else’s husband, but to Christ in your pursuit of faith, love, and purity.  \n  \nLadies, wondering if that guy is a good leader? Inspect these areas outlined for us in 1 Timothy 4:12. Is he leading in how he’s pursuing Christ, and maintaining purity? This may sound old-fashioned, but here’s the deal – I see a lot of relationships. I see the ones that work and the ones that don’t. I see the foolishness of people who think the Bible teaches old ideas while they embrace a MISERABLE dating track record.  \n  \nIn God’s created order, men lead. Godly submission in marriage means wives should follow their husbands, as their husbands follow Christ. Here is the truth: when men are living out their roles, to the best of their Spirit-led ability, women thrive and submission is easy. Similarly, when women, to their best of _their_ Spirit-led ability, live out their roles, the men are supported, properly helped, and made better, which allows for the further thriving of women. It’s what we like to call a win-win, and it’s what God called “very good.”  \n\n##### **Pursuing True Beauty**\n  \nIn verses 3-4 Peter begins to address the issue of beauty. Ladies, before you write off his words as outdated and extreme, he is not calling you to put away your bronzer and throw out your curling iron. Rather, he is saying that you should spend MUCH more time and energy on becoming truly beautiful, which is to say, godly. When you prioritize physical beauty over inner beauty, you are selling yourself short of the more full and true beauty found in walking with Christ. Spend time with Him and his Word, allow him to transform your heart and mind to look more like his… He is the great Origin and Creator of beauty. That sounds like a more strategic way to spend your morning routine. Worst case scenario: you continue to have mixed up priorities, get with a guy who is as confused as you, and you have a few short-lived, good-looking-on-the-outside-miserable-on-the-inside years.  \n  \nMen, you are to pursue women who are truly beautiful, which is to say, godly. Before you write off Peter’s words as outdated and extreme, realize that he is not telling you to pursue women you aren’t attracted to, but rather to consider whether or not you are attracted to what God says is attractive. If you are not attracted to what God says is attractive, it would be worth taking some time to think about why that’s the case. Pornography, for example, will ruin your attractions. If you know it has, stop “pursuing” altogether and prioritize your healing.  \n  \nAs Todd often says, bodies deteriorate (that’s science) – people should develop, invest in, and pursue that which lasts. That’s the person on the inside, not the outside.  \n  \nFinally, Peter in verse 7 speaks to husbands. In this verse he is calling men to self-sacrificial leadership. He warns them that anything short of honoring their wives will hinder their communion with God. Wait…What?!  \n\n##### **The Call is to Lead**\n  \nAnd all the ladies said “amen.” Like I said before, women in the ancient world had no rights. They couldn’t own property, they couldn’t speak in public, and their opinion meant nothing. Peter called men to use their strength to bless women, rather than oppress or undress them. In Ephesians 5:25-33, Paul is calling men to the same ideal. He calls men to leadership rooted in love, inspired by the First and Greatest Love. A man surrendered, submitted to Jesus, leading in love, is a man worth following.  \n  \nGod desires His people to live in peace and unity. He desires His people to be an example to the watching world of His intended design. The beauty and goodness of God’s design is found when things are working together, according to their God-ordained purpose.  \n  \nBut to quote Shakespeare, therein lies the rub. In today’s world our God-ordained purpose and our God-ordained roles as men and women are constantly being manipulated, maligned, and misrepresented. God Himself exists with purpose _and_ in relationship in the Trinity: God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Equal in rank, different in role. Likewise, men and women are equal in rank, in dignity, in value, but different in God-ordained role. You will not find true purpose and joy apart from living within the roles God has intended for us. When men and women live submitted first to God, then within their God-given roles, each thrives, and the world looks on with awe and wonder. Controversial or good? You decide.  \n  \n- Kirby  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

Mine has. Mine, weak as it was, included this pipe dream involving the summit of Mt. Everest. When I was younger I read every story and article I could and hung on every word detailing the experiences of professional climbers and dangerous expeditions. I was personally convinced that I would get to Everest one day.  \n  \nThen, around high school, I came across some statistics that gave me sobering perspective on the cost and time required to even make a summit _attempt_. I say attempt because even if you are lucky enough to have the time and resources to get there, you have a 1 in 10 chance of not living (aka dying) to tell the tale. Not summiting the mountain, but _living_ through the experience. I realized then that my dream coming true was unrealistic at best.  \n  \nThen, this past spring I had the chance to go on a discipleship trip to India and Nepal. When we were in Nepal the dreams I held years ago came flooding back. I could not come this close and not at least make an effort.  \n  \nWe scheduled a plane flight to do a Everest fly-by. I was as excited as I was disappointed. I felt a genuine sense of urgency to do something. _When would I be back? Would I ever get this chance again? Is this really all I’ll ever do?_ I was 29,000 feet high, headed to the Himalayas, and I realized Everest was more within reach than it ever had been. In fact, it was in sight. She was beautiful and menacing. Clouds hung over her summit and threatened anyone who would dare traverse her ice, rock, and snow-covered faces. Then it hit me as I was sitting in that tiny plane, or, that was the moment the Holy Spirit was waiting for to remind me of what Paul wrote in Romans 8:18-21,  \n  \n“_For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the anxious longing of creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.”_  \n  \nI will be back. In this lifetime? Probably not. In the next? With joy. In fact, not only will I be back to enjoy it, but I will be back with no capacity [for pain or sorrow](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21%3A4). There will be no lack of oxygen or sub-zero temperatures that could bring me off the mountain. I will experience her beauty in all of her intended God-given-and-inspired created glory. My bucket list evaporated.  \n  \nAll the time and money that was going to be given to my fun, adventurous “bucket list life” has been touched by this perspective. So what do I do with the rest of my days? Peter has an answer and he writes it to his friends in 1 Peter 4:7-11. He writes to them with the same sense of urgency I had felt, “_the end of all things is near_”, he says. And just when you would think he is going to encourage the early church to live it up in their last days and go see the hanging gardens of Babylon, or catch the epic chariot races in Rome, he completely redefines their priorities and encourages the church to start living differently and radically – to change their bucket lists.  \n  \n_“The end of all things is near. Therefore, be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray. Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. Each of you should use whatever gifts you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms. If anyone speaks, they should do as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.”_  \n  \nOur bucket lists need to change. JP summed it up [in a sermon](http://www.theporchdallas.com/media/) this way: Pray, Love, Give.  \n  \n\n\n##### **Item #1: Pray with Perspective**\n  \n _“The end of all things is near; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer”_  \n  \n\"I know what you’re thinking, “How could someone inspired by the Holy Spirit have been so off on his doomsday prediction?” The answer is in the question…the Holy Spirit. Peter, and several other early disciples of Christ, all lived and taught, convinced that they would see the return of the Lord in their day. I think there is something to be learned from their God-given perspective. Peter felt so compelled as to include it in his letter, “live like you are dying” (Tim McGraw paraphrase). His encouragement here is different than you may expect. He essentially says “your days are running out, so pay attention, and pray”. He is placing a high and immediate priority on prayer, something that we tend to only do when it’s “game-time”.  \n  \nPeter tells us to have sound judgment – to remain sober in spirit so that we can pray. We see that Peter places the highest priority on prayer. He encourages us to take measures to ensure that we can pray. How much time do you spend worrying? Probably a lot. How much time do you spend thinking about yourself, about your desires, about your future? More than you need to. Here’s the truth: thinking and worrying accomplishes nothing.  \n  \nHere’s the amazing thing: we have the opportunity in prayer to speak to, hear from and ask things of the Almighty God, who can and has changed the course of the universe. Instead of spending wasting your time thinking, pray. Pray as one who believes you are running out of time (because you are). Pray as though everything is a game-day/game-time decision (because it is). Our anxieties grow as we feed them with our irrational and unmeasured thoughts. A mark of an immature, insane person is constant, unmeasured thoughts. The mark of a sane, mature person is lots of prayer. One runs circles in their head. One runs to the ear of the One who knows all things and holds all things in His hands.  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Item #2: Love without Limits**\n  \n_“Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.”_  \n  \n Now that we are praying the right way, Peter tells us to love. Today, the definition of love could not be more misunderstood. Love has been confused with tolerance, which is confused with acceptance, which is just plain confused. Love does not mean accepting people the way they are and letting them stay that way because speaking up would be awkward. Love is the opposite of silence. The Scriptures teach that love [speaks up](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+27%3A5-6&version=NASB). Love is leaning into the “awkward” so that people can experience healing and freedom. Love sees people as they are and commits to not let them stay that way. I am willing to say that the single most important thing for us to understand in this day and age is a right definition of love.  \n  \n[Love is patient.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+13%3A4&version=NASB) It does [not keep a record of wrongs.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+13%3A5) When Peter says that love covers a multitude of sins, he is saying that love forgives. Not that love overcomes consequences, but that love [overlooks the minor offenses](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+19%3A11&version=NIV), forgives, extends grace, and practices patience. Look to the example of our Father. Do you think that He sees our minor offenses? Certainly, or at least, at one point He did. Does He overlook them? Yes, [because of Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+9%3A27-28&version=NIV). Has He forgiven us? Absolutely. Does He extend grace? Every day. Does He practice patience? [Without a doubt.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+peter+3%3A9&version=NIV) Of all the virtues He could have claimed, God says that [He is love.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A8) He said the greatest command is to [_love_ God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+6:5) and [_love_ others](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:27). He says the [greatest of all the characteristics of the faith is love.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+13%3A13&version=NASB) We must understand what true love means. Don’t let your love be watered down by the deluge of culture’s redefinitions.  \n  \nLove in a way that stretches your limits. Love self-sacrificially, putting the true well-being of others above your own comfort.  \n  \nGod, Love, broke through the silence of our world and spoke light into darkness. Then, in His great love for us, He broke again the silence of our sin by becoming like us. When He could have remained on high, He humbled himself and spoke to us words of life and love, in our language. This. Is. Love. _“Not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.”_  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Item #3: Glorify God with Your Gifts** \n  \nIf you’re thinking: “I don’t have gifts,” “I would glorify God if I had them,” and/or “I don’t know what my gifts are”. Here is what God is telling you: _“each one of you has received a special gift”_. Use it for others. Insecurity follows a person who sets out to use their gifts for their own good and their own glory.  \n  \nHere is God’s design: He gives you gifts, by His power, and He allows for your blessing when you steward them for the good of others. [Joy is made full](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A11&version=ESV) when we remember God’s order and design: Abide in Him, He will produce the fruit, you (and others) will be better for it. It is He who enables us to do the work. When we remember that we are to speak as _“those who are speaking the utterances of God_” we end up saying things that are more life-giving to others and uplifting to ourselves. See how God speaks to and about his own children graciously, lovingly, truthfully. When we serve, we do so as those who do so “_by the strength which God supplies”_ not on our own, but by His supernatural strength. His power and strength, His glory, our good.  \n  \nRemember His good design, _“in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs all the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen”_ God is not looking for the gifted, equipped, intelligent, he doesn’t need them. He is looking for the faithful and available. It is He who makes you gifted. If you don’t know what your “gifts” are, ask those who know you well, search the Scriptures, and commit to finding out!  \n  \nHere’s the reality. Our time here is short, and our days are numbered. He who is Love, He who broke the silence twice will break it once again. The time is coming quickly. He will [create new heavens and a new earth](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2065:17-25). In such a way that the former things will not be remembered. I’m not claiming that I know what New Earth will be like entirely, I do know it’s better than my best guess, but I think I will potentially climb Everest in a Hula skirt, after I run a marathon next to a cheetah, and watch a thousand suns rise and set over Antarctic glaciers at the south pole. So I’m going to commit my days to pray more, love more, and glorify Him with all that I have. I suddenly have a lot more time on my hands.  \n  \nAre you ready? Use the breaths you have left to communicate with the God of all things; love rightly, deeply and unconditionally; discover your gifts; deploy them for the Lord’s business, by His strength, in His great and perfect design.  \n  \nTime. . is…. running…… out.  \n  \n- Kirby  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

Please don’t show up, because you will be very alone. But please do be on mission, wherever you celebrate! Imagine the impact of 3,000+ young adults heading out into our city with the purpose of not just celebrating our national freedom, but of sharing the [freedom that we have in Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+5%3A1&version=NIV). Whether or not you got a Be Bold wristband at The Porch last week, go out and be bold with the gospel!  \n  \nHere are some ideas on where you can do that.  \n  \n\n\n##### **Dallas Fireworks**\n  \nBig D has some great options on July 3<sup>rd</sup> AND July 4<sup>th</sup>! Fireworks for days.  \n\n  \n- On the 3<sup>rd</sup>, [Kaboom Town](http://addisonkaboomtown.com/) in Addison dishes out a heaping dose of gridlocked traffic fireworks, said to be one of the best shows in the country. If West Dallas is more your style, there is [Red White & Boom](http://kluv.cbslocal.com/the-city-of-dallas-kluvs-red-white-boom-on-the-bridge-presented-by-mrs-bairds/) on the Margaret Hunt Hill bridge. That show is sponsored by Mrs. Bairds Bread, so gluten-sensitive beware! Or, if you prefer to go into full-on patriot mode and engage in our national pastime while watching fireworks, there’s always the [Texas Rangers game](http://purchase.tickets.com/buy/MLBEventInfo?orgid=3&agency=MLB&pid=8361497&tfl=Texas_Rangers-Schedule-2017_Promotional_Schedule-na-a0).\n  \n- On the actual 4<sup>th</sup>, you can head down to Fair Park for the [Fair Park Fourth](https://fairpark.org/index.php/en/?option=com_content&view=article&id=87) and get your fill of fireworks and Fletcher’s Corny Dogs. If you prefer more the neighborhood vibe, the show at [Lakewood Country Club](http://www.lakewoodcc.com/) is a solid local option.\n  \n  \n\n##### \n  \n\n##### **Suburb Fireworks**\n  \nYeah, Frisco, we get it – you’re not a suburb. Sure. But you do have a pretty cool fireworks show! [Frisco Freedom Fest](http://www.friscofreedomfest.org/) is on July 4<sup>th</sup>, and they say their show rivals anything else in North Texas. Kaboom Town attendees will be the judge of that, but the sparks fly after an FC Dallas soccer match – take that, big city!  \n\n##### **Fort Worth Fireworks**\n  \nThe show out west, [Fort Worth’s Fourth](http://fortworthsfourth.com/), claims to be the largest in North Texas. We’re waiting for scientific proof, but they are promising an F-16 flyover, so they win. America!  \n  \n  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

Sunlight. Water. No weeds. In case you missed David’s college agronomy lesson [at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4687), those are the things that grass needs to grow. Thank you, general elective classes! No doubt David has put that higher education to good use taking care of his own lawn, but the bigger question – and the real reason he shared that – is, what do _you_ need to grow? More specifically, what does your faith need so that it can grow? 1 Peter has some answers.  \n  \nIn chapter 5 Peter is wrapping up his letter to Christians who have been scattered because of persecution. These [few verses have some powerful truths](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter+5%3A5-7&version=NIV) about how to live and grow as a Christian. Some of them were written specifically to young adults, and they apply to our lives now just as much as they did when Peter wrote them nearly 2,000 years ago.\n\n##### **1.**  **Submit to Godly Leadership**\n  \n_“In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders.” (1 Peter 5:5)_  \n  \n This doesn’t mean that you have to do what someone says just because they’re older than you. It means you should put yourself underneath the leadership of godly elders who will help care for your soul and develop your faith. Do you have it all figured out spiritually? Didn’t think so. Being led by mature Christians with more spiritual experience than you is a great way to grow your faith.  \n  \nOne incredibly important way to do this is to join a local church as a member. Becoming a member means that you put yourself underneath the spiritual leadership of elders who meet the qualifications found in 1 Timothy 3:1-7 and Titus 1:6-9. Whatever church you join, make sure that it teaches the Bible accurately and calls people to actually follow its teachings! We talk a lot about church membership at The Porch. Listen to [this message](http://www.watermark.org/message/3885), or read [this blog post about the importance of church membership](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-church-membership-is-important/), and [this one about three reasons you should join a local church](http://www.theporchdallas.com/3-reasons-you-should-join-a-local-church/).  \n  \nIf you want to learn more about joining Watermark, you can check out our [Membership Class](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/connect/membership-class)!  \n\n##### **2. Clothe Yourself in Humility**\n  \n_“All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, ‘God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.’ Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.” (1 Peter 5:5b-6)_  \n  \nYou’ve probably got a favorite outfit – maybe it’s the latest one you bought, or the classic that you feel like a million bucks in. But would you like to know the best-looking thing you could possibly wear? It’s humility. Humility looks good on _everyone_, all the time, and it always fits.  \n  \nA great definition of humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less. Meaning, you don’t need to be down on yourself to be humble – you just need to [look to others’ needs more than you look to your own](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+2%3A3-4&version=NIV), and “I’m just watching out for number one” should not be in your vocabulary.  \n  \nLike that outfit, you have to _choose_ to put humility on. It doesn’t just happen. If you spend more time in the morning getting physically ready than you do getting spiritually ready, your priorities are probably off, and humility most likely isn’t the thing that marks your life. And that’s a pretty big deal, because God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble. Divine favor? Yes please. Hello, humility.  \n  \nFor more thoughts on what it means to be humble, check out [this blog post on revolutionary humility](http://www.theporchdallas.com/revolutionary-humility/).  \n\n##### **3. Don’t Carry Your Anxiety – Cast it**\n  \n_“Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.” (1 Peter 5:7)_  \n  \n Am I going to get that job? How am I going to make rent? Will I get married, and to whom? How will I pay off all this student debt? Am I ever going to get asked out? How do I cope with all this stress? Worry and anxiety can choke out the work of God’s Word in your life. Sound extreme? Jesus Himself said so in the [parable of the sower](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A1-23&version=NIV). You cannot grow spiritually if you are full of anxiety and try to carry it on your own.  \n  \nYou should not be holding onto a single ounce of anxiety in your life. Peter says to cast _all_ of it on God because He cares for you. It’s impossible for you to over-burden God with your worries. He can handle them, and [He wants to carry them for you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+68%3A19&version=NIV). Cast them on Him by praying specifically about the things you’re worrying about, asking for His help, and then trusting Him with the outcome. [He’s in control, He’s good, and He will help you make it through the day](http://www.theporchdallas.com/waging-war-on-worry-3-steps-to-peace/).  \n  \nLike grass, anxiety grows in a certain kind of soil – uncertainty. You’re not sure that things are going to work out, so you worry. But you know what else needs uncertainty to grow? [Faith](https://www.gotquestions.org/definition-of-faith.html)! If you handle uncertainty in your life by worrying about it, you’ll be burdened by anxiety and unable to grow. But if you handle uncertainty by praying about it and trusting God with it, you’ll find that your faith gets stronger as you see God work. Love Him. Trust Him. Lean on Him. He won’t let you down.  \n  \n- Luke  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you! You can email_ [_theporch@watermark.org_](mailto:theporch@watermark.org) _with any questions or comments.

Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith…(1 Peter 5:8-9a)_  \n  \nDo you know that you’re at war? That there’s an enemy out there, prowling around and looking for ways to make you his lunch? Buckle up – it’s true. Satan and his demons are alive and well. [They will get what’s coming to them](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+20%3A10&version=NIV), courtesy of divine judgment, but for now, the [struggle is very much real](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+6%3A10-13&version=NIV).  \n  \nYou don’t need to look for demons behind every bush, but you’d be foolish to ignore the spiritual reality that they exist and that they will do whatever they can to pull you away from walking with Jesus. As [Todd shared at the Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4758), the devil wants you to believe that God isn't good, that God’s Word isn't true, that disobeying God isn't a big deal, and that life can be found anywhere apart from God. This is what Satan always does – [just ask Adam and Eve](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+3%3A1-4&version=NIV).  \n  \nThe devil isn’t a buffoon – don’t think of some goofy-looking red guy with pointy horns and a pitchfork. He’s a powerful spiritual being! But he isn’t an irresistible force, and God has told us in His Word that [if we resist the devil, he will flee](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james+4%3A7&version=NIV). Here are seven things you need to know about doing that.  \n  \n\n\n##### **1) There is no secret about what's coming and who it's coming from.**\n  \nThe [devil is a liar and a murderer](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+8%3A44&version=NIV). In fact, he’s “the father of lies”. You can bet that Satan will try to use lies to get at you. Your weapon to fight those lies? [The full armor of God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+6%3A11-16&version=NIV), including the shield of faith and the sword of God’s Word. The lies are coming. You must know [the truth that can set you free](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+8%3A32&version=NIV) from them.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **2) There is no shame or sin in being tempted.**\n  \nEveryone is tempted. Even Jesus was tempted (though He didn’t sin), so [He knows what it’s like and has empathy for us](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+4%3A15&version=NIV). Temptation is a [common part of the human experience](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A1%603&version=NIV). Don’t feel ashamed that you are tempted, no matter what it is. The key is how you respond to temptation, which is one of the major battlefields.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **3) There is no such thing as a faithful person who surrenders to temptation.**\n  \nThis doesn’t mean that you won’t sin if you’re a faithful Christian. That would be impossible! There is [no one who is completely righteous](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+3%3A10&version=NIV). The key here is “surrender”, which means being so [hardened by sin’s deceitfulness](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+3%3A13&version=NIV) that you give yourself over to temptation instead of fighting it. No faithful soldier in this battle surrenders to the enemy. Even if you blow it, [get back up](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+24%3A16&version=NIV)! Don’t ever, ever, surrender. Keep fighting. Keep struggling! Read [this blog](http://www.theporchdallas.com/try-this-life-hack-to-fight-temptation/) and [this one](http://www.theporchdallas.com/5-steps-to-fight-temptation-and-win/) for more ammo.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **4) There is no Christian who is beyond falling.**\n  \nIf you think you’d never commit one of those “serious sins” (whatever you think that might be), or if you think that your consistent sins are small and unimportant, watch out! [Be especially careful so that you don’t fall](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+10%3A12&version=NIV). The only time you’ll be immune to sin is when you’re in heaven. Until then, shields up. No one ever thinks that it could happen to them, until it does.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **5) There are no special cases.**\n  \nJust like you aren’t immune to temptation, you can’t avoid the consequences of the sin that you give yourself to. You aren’t the special case that can pursue sin and not experience its effects. Thankfully, [Jesus paid for our sin](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+1%3A7&version=NIV), so those who have trusted in Him won’t experience the eternal consequence of separation from God, but your sin will still affect you in this life. [You will reap what you sow](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+6%3A7&version=NIV). If you sow porn and lust, you will reap an addiction and a twisted view of sexuality. If you sow a love of money, you’ll reap discontentment and materialism. The list goes on.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **6) There is no silver bullet.**\n  \nThere are no quick fixes to fight sin and temptation. You have to be alert, [battling daily](http://www.theporchdallas.com/battle-plan-for-fighting-sin/) against your fleshly desires and the attacks that Satan throws at you. There is no message, podcast, song, trip, or experience that will magically deliver you from sin’s influence. You must fight it every. Single. Day. The name of this game is 24/7 faithfulness, [getting from Jesus the strength you need for each day](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+15%3A4-5&version=NIV).  \n  \nIf you’d like to dig more into your recovery from any sin struggles, hurts, habits, or hang-ups that you have, we’d love to have you join us at [re:generation](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/regeneration-recovery)!  \n  \n  \n\n##### **7) There is no sense in going at it alone.**\n  \nThe Bible is clear – [if you isolate yourself, it won’t go well for you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+18%3A1&version=ESV). Struggling against sin all by yourself is a quick path to blowing it. You need people to [encourage you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+3%3A13&version=NIV), [challenge you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+3%3A16&version=NIV), and help [restore you and bear your burdens](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+6%3A1-2&version=NIV). [Two are better than one](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ecclesiastes+4%3A9-10&version=ESV)!  \n  \nAt Watermark, we do this through [community groups](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/community). You can also check out Open Community Group most Tuesdays right after the Porch for a chance to learn more about community and experience a taste of it.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Bonus: There is no such thing as a sinner so far gone that they are beyond hope!**\n  \nWhile you are alive, [God offers forgiveness to your repentance](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+3%3A19&version=NIV)! But He doesn't always offer tomorrow to your procrastination. There are usually second chances, but there will always be a[_last chance_](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+3%3A19&version=NIV), after which comes judgment. If you’re still breathing, it hasn’t come yet for you. If you haven’t trusted in Jesus Christ to pay the penalty for your sins and to give you eternal life, respond to Him before your last chance comes!  \n  \nKeep resisting,  \n  \n- Luke"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"11XFz7ff1g2aceAMcKSQAs"}}},"url":{"en-US":"your-enemy-is-after-you"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/your-enemy-is-after-you/"}}},

Whether it's Waze, Google Maps, or Apple Maps, have you ever been certain it's wrong? Once I was visiting a friend who lived in Keller, a town I don't visit often. Our families were meeting for dinner, and I was stuck in rush hour traffic. The cars in front of me were at a standstill, and cars were piling up behind me. To my left was a turn off. Even though my map app, which accounts for traffic, wasn't saying I should turn, I was certain it was a better way.  \n  \nAs I turned off, my GPS continued to tell me to turn around. It was wrong. I was driving parallel to the freeway-turned-parking-lot, thinking how I had outsmarted the machine. The kids were hungry and Monica wasn't so sure, but it appeared that I had gotten away with a fantastic shortcut. Then, just as the restaurant was within site, I hit a forced turnaround that took us around the city and put us back in line where we were. Only we were now behind all the cars that were previously behind us.  \n  \nWhen searching for direction, we have to know what source of information we should trust. Proverbs 3:5-6 exhorts us not to lean on our understanding. Ok, cool. Whose understanding should I lean on then? My GPS apps have proven trustworthy, but the problem is that I have another device that has proven untrustworthy. To confuse matters even more, it is the device I am most prone to trust. It's my heart. Not the beating, blood-pumping organ, but my emotional center, the core of my being, AKA my gut, AKA my feelings. That heart is untrustworthy.  \n  \nThink about it. Have you ever been in love? Are you still in love? If not, what happened? Your heart was being unreliable, that's what happened. Ever thought you were going to marry somebody? Or have you ever really wanted something, only to buy it and then let it collect dust? Our heart leads us astray all the time. So, if we can't \"follow our heart\", what things can we rely on to accurately navigate us through the directions of life?  \n  \n\n\n##### **Go to God**\n  \nWhen you [trusted in Jesus' death and resurrection for the forgiveness of your sins](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+10%3A9-10&version=NIV), you were [given the Holy Spirit](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+1%3A13-14&version=NIV). This is direct access to God Almighty. You can talk to Him, and He can hear you. He controls things...all things. [Trust in Him with all your heart and in all your ways acknowledge Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+3%3A5-6&version=NIV), and He will direct you.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Pray Through the Scriptures** \n  \nRight about now you're probably thinking, \"that's great, I can talk to God, but He's not so good at talking back.\" He's actually really great at talking back, but it seems the medium He most uses is His inspired Word, the Bible. Why should you read the Bible? One of many reasons is that you get to read the desires of and wisdom from God Himself. When you are reading the Bible, be in prayer. Ask God to help you understand His Word and ask Him for wisdom from it.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Seek Wise Counsel**\n  \nThere are about a dozen Proverbs that effectively say, \"you don't know, so you better ask somebody.\" Maybe a better paraphrase is \"[wisdom comes from the counsel of many](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+15%3A22&version=NIV)\". Get other solid Christians in a room. Present your questions and situation, with all the necessary details. Allow them to ask any questions they want. Then ask them what you should do. Let them work it out together with you and hopefully gain a consensus. Pray that the Lord would speak through them, and ask them to share Bible verses that inform their counsel. After all, why only listen to mortal man, when we have God's Word? Men who know me and know God's Word and who will tell me the truth are invaluable to me. They are priceless sources of godly direction.  \n  \nNext time you're lost in life's decisions, remember your **GPS** :  \n\n  \n- **G** o to God\n  \n- **P** ray through the scriptures\n  \n- **S** eek wise counsel\n  \n  \nIt will get you unstuck every time.  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n   \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

(It does.) But have you ever wondered _why_ God would warn against it?  \n  \nGod does not set up rules just to make things difficult or keep us from having fun. Actually, it is the opposite: God only prohibits things because they are harmful to us, and hurt our relationship with Him. We are not to murder, steal, lie, or cheat on our spouses because those things _always_ lead to pain for one or both of the parties involved. That is true even if you don’t believe in God, because the consequences we are talking about take place here in this life.  \n  \nThe same is true with premarital sex: regardless of your beliefs, premarital sex is still a really bad idea.\n\n##### **Sex Ed**\n  \nSome of the potential consequences of premarital sex, such as pregnancy or STDs, are so obvious that it seems almost silly to mention them. Besides, you can eliminate those possibilities if you are careful, right?  \n  \nMaybe not:  \n\n  \n- In the U.S., there are more than 3 million unintended pregnancies each year, and around 1 million abortions. Singles account for almost all of those abortions, and the majority were using some form of contraception.\n  \n- According to the CDC, there are about 19 million new cases of sexually transmitted diseases in the U.S. each year. STDs would be virtually nonexistent if not for sex outside of marriage; if each person had only one partner, they would have no STD to transmit.\n  \n  \nStill, at least you can take steps to make those things less likely. There are other consequences, though, that you can’t protect against.  \n\n##### **Your Brain on Sex**\n  \nThe reason sex is so pleasurable is because it triggers the release of chemicals (such as dopamine, oxytocin, and vasopressin) in the brain. Some important things to know about these natural drugs:  \n\n  \n- **They produce emotional bonds.** Oxytocin, for example, plays a big role in causing mothers to bond with their newborn children. They are part of God’s design for sex because they cause you to bond with your spouse. Outside of marriage, they still cause you to bond—with your girlfriend, your computer screen, or whomever/whatever may be present at the time.\n  \n- **They are addictive.** They create passageways in the brain that then become a “path of least resistance” towards that next chemical high. In other words, each time it becomes a bit easier to say “yes” and harder to say “no.”\n  \n  \nSo, when you have sex outside of marriage, you are creating that strong bond with the person, whether in real life or on a screen or in a fantasy. But most of the time, you don’t end up marrying that person. There is a break-up, which is more painful because of the bond. You start seeing someone else, and since you are becoming conditioned to it, you are now more likely to have sex with them—and also bond with them.  \n\n##### **Wrecking Your Marriage Before It Starts**\n  \nNow let’s say that you do get married at some point. Numerous studies show that people who have premarital sex are more prone to divorce. The biology of it explains why: they are not bonded just to their spouse. If anything, they are addicted to variety—taught not to bond. Here are a few examples:  \n\n  \n- The divorce rate is around 50% for all couples, but only 9% if both partners are virgins before getting married. If you wait to have sex until you're married, your chances of getting divorced decrease by 70%!\n  \n- Couples who live together before getting married are 250% more likely to divorce in the first five years of marriage than those who don't cohabitate.\n  \n- 90% of people who live together first, don't get married. 80% of those who do get married afterwards, get divorced. That is about an overall 2% success rate for a healthy marriage if you live together first!\n  \n  \nSome people claim that is just how humans are, and that we are not wired for monogamy. But the bonding chemicals prove that we actually _are_ [created for monogamy](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%202:24&version=NIV); the problem is that we have rewired our brains by using sex outside the commitment of marriage.  \n\n##### **My Story**\n  \nI say all this because this is part of my story. I started having sex in high school. By college, sex had become a sport for me, and I eventually became a sex addict.  \n  \nThen I came to know Christ, and got married. At my wedding, I literally prayed and thanked God that I had escaped the consequences: specifically, that I did not have an STD, or a child born out of wedlock, or a psycho ex-girlfriend waiting outside to kill me. I thought I had [gotten away with it](http://theporch.wpengine.com/getting-away-with-it/).  \n  \nI hadn’t.  \n  \nYear 1 of our marriage: honeymoon. Year 2: disaster. It was a misery I can’t even put into words. I know you may find this hard to believe, but I would have gladly chosen the consequences of having an STD or a child out of wedlock, over being imprisoned to a struggle with a woman that I had no idea how to love.  \n  \nGod has worked in and through us since then, to bring healing and to build this really amazing marriage that I don’t deserve. But it was hard, and I want to spare you that.  \n  \nI also want to let you know there is hope; you are not disqualified for anything just because you are not a virgin. But the best way to pursue what God has for you is to start healing now.  \n  \n- JP"},"featuredImage":{"en-US":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"2HYF735kCk0AWEqOeAO6UC"}}},"url":{"en-US":"why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea"},"postUrl":{"en-US":"http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/"}}},

This [desire to be married isn’t bad](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+18%3A22&version=NIV), unless it distracts you from the [work that God has for you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A10&version=NIV) while you’re single. And contrary to what some people think, being single is not a curse. If you believe that “real life begins when you get married,” you’ve swallowed some [bad advice](http://www.watermark.org/message/4855).  \n  \nThe time you spend single—which may be a temporary life stage, or could be your whole life—[is actually a gift](http://www.theporchdallas.com/gift-of-singleness/), and you should treat it like one. Being single gives you the opportunity to do some things that would become more difficult after marriage, and also to properly prepare for marriage if that is your goal. It’s a chance to live for God in a unique way, right here and now.  \n  \nSo how do you get the most out of your singleness? Here’s some good advice on how to use that gift.\n\n##### **1. Use time wisely.**\n  \nYou’ll never have more free time than you do right now, as a single person. If you’re tired of hearing that over and over from married people, that’s because it’s true. They’re all speaking from experience. So how will you use this time? ([1 Timothy 4:12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%204:12))  \n  \n\n##### **2.**  **Go somewhere difficult.**\n  \nYou can always travel, but you can’t always travel anywhere. Marriage, kids, and even older age can make many trips more difficult and complicated. But right now, you can travel pretty much anywhere that your car or an airline will take you. So see the world. Go somewhere that needs Jesus and share Him there. Spend your weekends sharing the gospel in your city. ([Romans 10:15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+10%3A15&version=NIV)). _Opportunities:_ [_International discipleship trips_](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/international/international-discipleship-trips)_;_ _[Unashamed weekend trips](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/unashamed)_  \n  \n\n##### **3. Work to learn, not just to earn.**\n  \nHaving things like a family and a mortgage do cost money, requiring a reliable income and somewhat limiting your job options. If you’re single and relatively young, you can prepare for that now by learning the skills you’ll need to get the job you really want. Look for a job that will pay you to learn those skills—it may not pay much, but that’s OK, because you only have one mouth to feed. [Even if you hate your job](http://www.theporchdallas.com/what-to-do-if-you-hate-your-job/), it gives you a place to learn and to live on mission. ([Proverbs 22:29](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+22%3A29&version=NIV))  \n\n##### **4.**  **Get to know the Bible.**\n  \nContinuing on the “learning” topic, the best time to learn your Bible is now. Again, you’ll never have more time to study, and you’ll never have more years to benefit from learning it and putting it into practice. There’s no better “skill” to learn than to know how to navigate and utilize the Word of God. You’ll learn who God is and what He desires for you, and be able to give Godly counsel to others when they are in need. ([2 Timothy 3:16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3%3A16&version=NIV)) _Opportunities:_ [_Men’s Bible study_](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/mens-bible-study)_,_ [_Women’s Bible study_](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/womens-bible-study)_,_ [_Equipped Disciple classes_](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/equipped-disciple)  \n  \n\n##### **5. Pursue purity.**\n  \nOne of the greatest gifts you can give your future spouse is to limit the amount of sexual baggage and bad habits you bring into the marriage. And there is no better time than now to learn how to be faithful in a relationship. If you practice blindly following your sexual urges, you’ll develop the habit of always following your sexual urges—even if they lead you outside your future marriage. [Learn to hate porn](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-hate-pornography/). [Don’t live together](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-not-live-together/). [Avoid premarital sex](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/). ([1 Corinthians 6:18](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A18+&version=NIV))  \n  \n\n##### **6.**  **Pray for your future spouse.**\n  \nPray how? Well, you can start by praying this list for them. Pray that they would be using their singleness well and preparing for marriage. Pray that they would know God and walk faithfully with Him. Pray that you both would trust His timing and not get derailed by “[shortcuts](http://www.theporchdallas.com/shortcuts-to-sex/).” ([1 Thessalonians 5:16-18](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16-18&version=NIV))  \n\n##### **7.**  **Join a church and serve there.**\n  \nThis seems like a no-brainer, but I had to put it in the list because for some crazy reason, young adults seem slow to join and get involved at a church. I don’t get it. If you’re a Christian and part of [the body of Christ](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+12%3A12-30&version=NIV), you’re not meant to live outside the body—it would be like your pancreas trying to survive outside your own body. God made you to be alive in His church. So, find some imperfect church (they are all imperfect in some way) that teaches the Bible and join there. Come under the elders’ authority. Live in community with other members. Serve and give there. Share your talents there so that you might experience life as it was given to you to experience.

Get a roommate.**\n  \nNothing will prepare you for marriage better than having a really dysfunctional roommate. I’m serious. Some single people say, “I like living by myself.” Well, then you are going to HATE marriage. I’d practice by living with roommates now. Work through conflict with them. Serve them. Practice communicating well with them. [In case you think I am talking about someone of the opposite sex: I am not. Read this.](http://theporch.wpengine.com/why-not-live-together/) ([Proverbs 27:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+27%3A17&version=NIV)) _Opportunities: a lot of people post roommate needs and openings on_ [_this Facebook group_](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2373518146/) _or_ [_this one_](https://www.facebook.com/groups/313860108735428/)_._  \n  \n\n##### **9.**  **Build healthy habits.**\n  \nTaking care of your body gets more and more difficult. At some point in life your metabolism slams on the brakes, but your eating habits and exercise habits continue as before. So, train them well now. Scripture says your body is a temple. It doesn’t need to be a chiseled temple that you stare at in the mirror, but it should remain a healthy temple. ([1 Corinthians 6:19-20](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+6:19-20&version=NIV))  \n  \n\n##### **10.**  **Look for a spouse.**\n  \nDisregard this one if you don’t want to be married. If you do, however, you can be sure that a spouse will not fall through the ceiling into your lap. (If they did, go back to number 4.) To find a spouse, you need to be where future spouses are—see also number 7.

But what does that even mean?  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s one of the [most important proverbs](http://theporch.wpengine.com/12-proverbs-for-young-adults/). In a book filled with hundreds of the wisest pieces of advice ever written, this is the only one to say “above all else.” In the original Hebrew, it basically means to guard it more than you guard anything else: more than your car, your house, or your family. More than you guard any of those things, guard your heart.  \n  \n  \n  \nBut how do you guard your heart?  \n  \n  \n\n##### **What “Guarding Your Heart” Means**\n  \nFor starters, it’s definitely not all about dating. It does include dating, but that would be just a small part of guarding your heart.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s also, perhaps obviously, not talking about the blood-pumping organ inside your chest. Although, notably, that is the most protected of all your vital organs; God designed us with a guarded heart.  \n  \n  \n  \nWhat it does mean is what we normally talk about being in someone’s heart or coming from the heart: our desires, morals, or feelings. As the proverb says, everything you do—your whole life—flows from those things.  \n  \n  \n  \nGuarding your heart means that you’re very careful what you let in it: what desires you feed, what you focus on, what thoughts or feelings you dwell on. You guard it like a knight guards a castle: letting allies in, keeping enemies out, and being very wary when you’re not sure the difference.  \n  \n\n##### **Why You Should Guard Your Heart**\n  \nBecause if your heart’s not doing well, you’re not doing well. Your relationships, your work, your words, your actions, are not going to go well for you. _Everything_ you do flows from it.  \n  \n  \n  \nYour heart functions on a standard garbage in, garbage out equation. Fill it with good things, and it will produce good things. Fill it with garbage, and it will produce garbage—and even start to seek out garbage. It develops an appetite for garbage.  \n  \n  \n  \nFor example: if you struggle with pornography (or have in the past), you’ll know that giving in and looking at pornography one time does not then make it easier to stop and turn away. It makes it more difficult, and makes your appetite for it that much stronger. And each time you go back, you desire just a little bit more: something more risqué, more taboo, more perverted. Your heart desires things that are worse and worse for you. This is why, to [overcome a pornography addiction](http://theporch.wpengine.com/how-to-overcome-a-pornography-addiction/), you have to remove all access to it so that you stop feeding your heart that and increasing those desires.  \n  \n  \n  \nAnother example: after speaking at The Porch, it’s not unusual to have single women come up looking for help because they “only date losers,” or some variation of that. They’re always attracted to, and always end up dating, “losers”—guys who will take advantage of them, or hurt them, or break their hearts. In response, I ask them what might seem like a random question: What are your favorite TV shows and favorite songs? The answers will usually be shows and songs that portray or glorify that kind of dating with those kinds of guys.  \n  \n  \n  \nIt’s not a complicated math equation. You’ve trained your heart to pursue losers. You’ve put it on the scent of losers. You’ve basically gone to a university of how to date losers.  \n  \n  \n  \nThe same thing can apply to just about anything else you feed into your heart—good, bad, or indifferent. Your heart’s like a GPS device: whatever you program into it, that’s where it’s going to lead you. And if you’re not careful with it, you’ll end up somewhere you don’t want to be: addictions, harmful relationships, broken marriage, or even despair. In fact, most cases of depression I've seen exist because someone was not careful about what they fed their heart.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **How to Guard Your Heart**\n  \nI know the world says to trust your heart. Follow your heart. Listen to your heart. But the Scripture doesn’t say to follow your heart; it says to inform your heart. Teach it what it should pursue.  \n  \n  \n  \nHow do you do that? The rest of Proverbs 4 gives us four things to consider:  \n\n  \n1. **Be careful what you talk about.** Proverbs 4:24: “Keep your mouth free of perversity; keep corrupt talk far from your lips.” What you talk about can feed your heart.\n  \n2. **Be careful what you look at.** Proverbs 4:25: “Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you.” What (or who) are you watching? Far too often we are entertained by the very things Christ died for. Some resources I’ve found that help me decide what would be healthy or unhealthy for me to watch: [Plugged In](http://www.pluggedin.com/) and [Kids in Mind](http://www.kids-in-mind.com/).\n  \n3. **Be careful where you go.** Proverbs 4:26: “Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways.” Often, guarding your heart—and changing what you talk about and look at—requires changing where you hang out and who you hang out with. Changing your playground and playmates.\n  \n4. **If something seems evil, stay far from it.** Proverbs 4:27: “Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.” Now, something good or neutral can become evil when it becomes more important than God in our lives. Think watching the Cowboys: there’s nothing wrong with that, _unless_ it becomes so important that a loss makes you angry or depressed all week.\n  \n  \n  \n  \nIn place of those things, feed your heart a healthy diet of the things of God. Read and memorize Scripture. Build deep relationships with other Christ-followers through [community](http://theporch.wpengine.com/connect/community/). Fellowship and [have a blast](http://theporch.wpengine.com/what-is-the-launch-retreat/) with people who will encourage you to pursue the right things.

We talked about whether he was more likely to be a positive influence on his friends in those situations, or if his friends were more likely to drag him down. Based on where he was, he made the tough – but wise and necessary – choice to move on from those friends and look for more positive influences in his life.  \n  \nIt’s [bad advice to think that you shouldn't leave your friends behind](http://www.watermark.org/message/4894) if they’re dragging you down. In fact, you _have to_, or you’ll get dragged down too. But how should you choose whether to stick around or find new friends?\n\n##### **Choosing Your Friends**\n  \nYour friends make a big part of who you are. God has a lot of wisdom to share on the type of people you should be doing life with. Here are three things He has to say:  \n\n  \n- **The company you keep is stronger than the convictions you hold**. No matter what you believe, if you consistently spend time in relationships with people who do not believe or live out those same things, you will be dragged down. Don’t be deceived – bad company corrupts good character (1 Corinthians 15:33).\n  \n- **Your friends determine who you are**. If you show me your friends, I’ll show you your future. We are all the sum of the someone’s in our lives. If you spend time with people who are wise, you’ll grow wise. But if you spend time with fools, it won’t go well for you (Proverbs 13:20).\n  \n- **Friendships aren’t built by chance; they are built by choice.** You have to choose well. People who want to follow God must choose their friends carefully, because hanging out with ungodly people leads you astray (Proverbs 12:26).\n  \n  \nThe [crowd you’re running with matters](http://www.theporchdallas.com/where-are-you-running-and-whos-running-with-you/). If it’s not the right one, you need to [change your playground and your playmates](http://www.theporchdallas.com/changing-playground-and-playmates/). You should be looking for friends who love Jesus and don’t just check the box on their faith (Matthew 22:37), who encourage you to follow Jesus (Hebrews 3:13), and who share truth with you, even when it hurts (Proverbs 27:6).  \n  \n_Ask yourself questions like these:_ Are my friends [wise or foolish people based on God’s definition](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+7%3A24-27&version=NIV)? Are they walking with Christ? Do they encourage me in my relationship with Christ? Are they running from sin and towards righteousness? Am I a positive influence on them? Are they a positive influence on me?  \n\n##### **Choosing Who You Date and Marry**\n  \nThe people you date, and the person you potentially marry, will have an incredible influence on you. They will lead you towards Christ or away from Him, towards temptation and sin or away from it, towards a healthy relationship or away from one. If you have children, they will also be profoundly influenced by this person. Would you want that person to be the mother/father of your kids?  \n  \nSo, what kind of things should you be looking for? Check these out:  \n\n  \n- [10 Things a Man Should Look for in a Woman](http://www.theporchdallas.com/10-things-a-man-should-look-for-in-a-woman/)\n  \n- [10 Things a Woman Should Look for in a Man](http://www.theporchdallas.com/10-things-a-woman-should-look-for-in-a-man/)\n  \n- [How to Know if You’ve Found “the One”](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-to-know-if-youve-found-the-one/)\n  \n  \n_Ask yourself questions like these:_ What do I value in a potential spouse? Do my decisions of who I’m interested in and pursuing actually reflect those values? Are my relationships marked by purity or impurity? Does my partner encourage me to be more like Jesus? What are my partner’s friends like?  \n\n##### **Bonus: Choosing a Church**\n  \nAre you deeply connected to a local church? [You should be](mailto:http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-church-membership-is-important/). How are you choosing the church you’re at – like a cruise ship or like a battleship? For that to make sense, watch [this short video](https://vimeo.com/1986489) (it’s a bit old school, but bear with me). The Bible says that your church leaders are watching over your soul (Hebrews 13:17) – you want to make absolutely sure that the right people are doing that! The [mission, leadership, and people of the church](http://www.theporchdallas.com/3-reasons-you-should-join-a-local-church/) will all have a profound influence on you. [Don’t just make an app or a podcast your church](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-an-app-shouldnt-replace-your-church/), and don’t church-hop – get deeply connected in a Christ-exalting, Bible-teaching, community-focused local church.  \n  \n_Ask yourself questions like these:_ Am I choosing a church based on how comfortable it is, or based on its mission? What are the things that I value in a church? Am I a church-hopper / church-shopper? If I haven’t committed to a local church, why not? Do I trust the church’s leaders to be accountable for my soul?  \n  \nIf you’re looking for new friends who love Jesus, or looking for a church to connect with, we’d love to help you with this!

If someone asked you why God might let you in, would your answer be anything like “well, I try to be a good person”? Or maybe because you haven’t killed anyone? A lot of people think they are good enough…or maybe they’re not sure if they are, but they’re trying to be. But what does “good” actually mean, and how good is “good enough”?  \n  \nOn [Tuesday at The Porch](http://www.watermark.org/message/4781) we talked about the bad advice that “good people go to heaven.” A lot of people believe this – and it might be the most dangerous lie that there is. Why? Because it affects where you’re going to spend forever and ever. If you believe it, your eternal soul is at risk. Good people don’t go to heaven.  \n  \nThe Bible is clear on the relationship between your goodness and heaven. In short, there isn’t one. Or more accurately, one Person’s goodness does determine whether you’ll go to heaven. But that person isn’t you.  \n  \n\n\n##### **No one is good enough for heaven**\n  \n_“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23)_  \n  \n _“For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.” (James 2:10)_  \n  \n If someone asked you, “are you a good person?” what would you say? I’m guessing that you’d try to be humble in your answer – after all, who’s perfect – but you probably think you’re a pretty good guy / gal. Here’s the problem, at least when we’re talking about being good enough to get into heaven: definitions really matter, and yours is probably wrong. When we talk about being good, we generally mean something like “good for the most part,” or “better than that obviously terrible person.” But God’s standard of goodness is [perfection](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5%3A48&version=ESV), and that’s what He requires to let you into heaven.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Doing good won't make you good enough for heaven**\n  \n_“Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.” (Romans 3:20)_  \n  \n _“Then they asked him, ‘What must we do to do the works God requires?’ **<sup> </sup>** Jesus answered, ‘The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.’” (John 6:28-29)_  \n  \n But what about doing good works? Isn’t that what God requires to get into heaven? No it isn’t, and that’s at the core of the “good people go to heaven” lie. We think that somehow, even if we aren’t perfect, doing enough good will let us earn our way into heaven. This is called “performance-based acceptance.” We perform for God by doing good things, and He accepts us into heaven as a result. That might make sense to our human way of thinking, but it doesn’t line up with God’s. He does [want us to do good works](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+2%3A10&version=ESV), but as a _response_ to our salvation – not to _earn_ it. This is called “acceptance-based performance.” God [accepts us in Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+15%3A7&version=NASB), and we obey Him as a response. It’s not the other way around. There is no amount of good that you can do for God to let you into heaven. It’s like trying to throw a baseball to the moon. You might get closer than I would, but you still won’t make it. Nice try, but still an epic fail.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **Only God can make you good**\n  \n_“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.” (Romans 3:23-24)_  \n  \n _“God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” (2 Corinthians 5:21)_  \n  \n You can’t get to God through your good works. But the amazing truth of [the gospel](http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-gospel/) is that God made a [way to Him](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14%3A6&version=NIV) through Jesus Christ. When [you personally trust in Jesus’ death and resurrection as payment for your sins](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+10%3A9-10&version=NIV), you’re saved! When that happens, [your slate is wiped clean forever](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+2%3A13-14&version=NIV) of all past, present, and future sins. God forgives you and welcomes you into His family [as His child](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+john+3%3A1&version=NIV). You can’t do anything to earn this, you can only accept the [free gift](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6%3A23&version=NIV). Only God can make you good enough for heaven. The beautiful thing is that when you trust in Jesus for your salvation, God _does_ make you good enough by giving you the perfect righteousness of Jesus.  \n  \nGood people don’t go to heaven, but forgiven people do. And the only way to get forgiven is through Jesus. Have you been forgiven?  \n  \n- Luke  \n  \n  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

The rats would hit that lever as much as 7,000 times per hour. Male rats would ignore a female rat in heat for the ease of hitting the lever repeatedly. A similar experiment was conducted on humans in the 60’s. While it clearly included some unethical practices, it yielded similar results. I share that with you to help us understand that we will pass up the sex that God designed us for in exchange for something quick and easy. This has tremendous implications for pornography, technology, prostitution, masturbation, and of course, the future of marriage.\n\n##### **Gourmet sex or “fast food” sex?**\n  \nHealthy sex within marriage requires a considerable amount of work. Husbands and wives must pursue each other. Work hard to keep peace with one another. Help each other. And create an environment where sex is even possible. The kids in the other room might have been tugging at them for attention. Work may have been stressful and demanding. Sexually healthy spouses are two selfish people who put their own desires aside in order to serve the other and create an environment conducive to marital intimacy. Every married person I’ve ever talked to would agree that intimacy in marriage requires a lot of work.  \n  \nI’m noticing more and more, that my generation isn’t prepared for this kind of work. They didn’t expect it. They had thousands of options for a sexual experience at their fingertips. In their pockets, they’ve had a little device that can display to them the most explicit images imaginable. They no longer need to go through the embarrassment of purchasing an adult magazine at the local gas station. They don’t have to seek out an adult bookstore or experience the shame of walking into a strip club. Porn is now readily available and anonymous. A virtual reality experience can be purchased for $12.99 and an iPhone. Prostitution can be found on Craigslist, and the development of “sex robots” is making headlines. In a similar way to how McDonalds changed the availability of the hamburger, the sexual landscape has changed considerably in that it is fast, cheap, and everywhere.  \n  \nBut we all know there’s a difference between a fast food hamburger and a gourmet steak. One takes high quality ingredients and skillful preparation, while the other is thrown together by a high school employee. But listen, this is where the metaphors break down. The difference between counterfeit sex and marital intimacy is a much bigger one. So many people have settled for counterfeit sex, that God’s design for marital intimacy is more and more like the unicorn. Most of you reading this will never even experience it.  \n\n##### **It’s worth it – but what is it?**\n  \nLet me define “it” for you. It is intimacy between a husband and a wife that has come after relentless pursuit. Remember when you tried to get the attention of the head cheerleader or the captain of the football team? It’s a much greater pursuit than that. “It” has prioritized the relationship above life’s distractions. “It” knows there is a lot at stake. “It” takes place in the safety of the marriage covenant, when you know that you do not only have an intimate partner, you belong exclusively to your intimate partner and they belong exclusively to you. Something has been paid for this relationship. It is valuable in that it was waited for, celebrated, and held in high regard.  \n\n##### **Settling for counterfeit sex**\n  \nToday, many of us will exchange that for an addictive, fleeting, moment of pleasure. Our appetite for the counterfeit product grows, and our resolve to fight for the real thing diminishes. In the end you have a bunch of people who have settled for something counterfeit, while being completely unaware of the reward that awaits the relentless pursuit of God’s ideal. “It’s not worth it” we subconsciously think. When in reality, we have no idea what “it” is worth. We have only trained for non-marital intimacy. We’ve become pros at adultery ([sex of any kind outside of marriage](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5%3A27-28&version=NIV)). More than pros, we’ve become addicts to sex outside of marriage. And in some naive ploy, we think we’re going to walk down an aisle and instantly be amazing lovers to our new spouse. That’s not going to happen, because [premarital sex is not just a really bad idea](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-premarital-sex-is-a-bad-idea/), it has real consequences for a marriage.  \n  \nAs it turns out, before marriage, purity is better training for marital intimacy than practice is. Within marriage, “practice” is a lot of fun. But when we’ve “practiced” outside of marriage, we bring so many insecurities and so much shame into marriage, that what we’ve actually been training for is failure.  \n\n##### **It’s not too late to start over**\n  \nThankfully, the gospel says [it’s never too late to begin to pursue God’s best](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+3%3A19&version=NIV). Our sins have real consequences, but when we trust in Christ’s payment for forgiveness, [we escape the eternal consequences](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+2%3A14&version=NIV). No matter your sexual background or baggage, your sin is not too big for God to forgive or heal you. Not only that, but [God Himself will help you pursue His sexual ideal here in this world](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=philippians+2%3A13&version=NIV).  \n  \nWhat are you waiting for? Do you want to keep training for failure by pursuing counterfeit sex, or do you want to start training for deep marital intimacy that can only be found between two people who are surrendered to Christ and loving each other with a love that only He can give? Commit to pursuing purity. If you have sexual hurts, habits, or hang-ups that you need help with, commit to pursuing Christ-centered recovery (check out [re:generation on Monday nights](http://www.watermark.org/events/20) in Dallas). And commit to pursuing and being pursued by a [community of other Christ-followers](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/community/grouplink/singles-community-formation) who will hold you accountable and help support you on the journey.  \n  \nStarting over on sex is part of my story.

Your heartbeat kicks up a notch. You look around to see who else might be watching. You rehearse your opening line a few times in your head, praying that you nail it on the first try. Wait! How does it go again?! OK. You take a deep breath, summon your courage, and open your mouth to…  \n  \nWhat’s the scenario? I’m not talking about asking that certain someone on a first date, though it might feel similar. I’m talking about sharing your faith. You get nervous. You feel awkward. You wonder what the best way to do it is. And then a lot of times, you just keep quiet.  \n  \nMost Christians believe that it’s [bad advice to keep quiet about their faith](http://www.watermark.org/message/4870). They know they _should_ share the gospel. But far fewer of them actually break the silence. How about you?  \n  \nWhether you’ve got the [gift of evangelism](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+4%3A11&version=NIV), or the need to share your faith feels like something you’d rather return, here are seven keys that anyone can apply to share their faith in a way that’s natural, clear, and effective.\n\n##### **1. Check your motives (or lack thereof)**\n  \nDo you really believe that everyone will live forever somewhere? Jesus said that every person is headed either for [eternal life or eternal punishment](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46). Their response to the gospel determines where they go. Does that motivate you to share it? There are some great reasons to share your faith, like compassion and care about someone’s eternal future, and obedience to [Jesus’ direct command](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV). There are also some not-so-great ones, like doing it just so that other people see you do it. Check your motives, and ask God to give you the [right ones](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A14-15&version=NIV).  \n  \nIf you aren’t motivated to share and don’t prioritize it in your life, dig into why that is. Do you really believe that everyone is headed to either heaven or hell, and do you care about which one? Do you think that someone else will share with that person, so why bother? Do you think that your time is more valuable than the few minutes it would take? Life is too short to be silent. No one is promised tomorrow. No reason is a good enough reason to not share. Ask God to make this [clear to you](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+1%3A16&version=NIV).  \n\n##### **2. Deal with your hesitations and fears**\n  \nWhy _wouldn’t_ you share your faith? That’s not a rhetorical question. Literally, what makes you hesitant or uncomfortable or afraid? Is it what someone else would think, or how they might react? Is it being unsure of what to say? Is it wondering what other questions you might be asked but couldn’t answer? Is it that it feels, well, awkward?  \n  \nIdentifying those things is the first step. But don’t stop there! Share them with your community group and ask them to help you work through them. Reach out to someone at your church. Chances are good that someone shared the gospel with you at one point – ask them how they share their faith. Put together a plan for how you can tackle your obstacles. Don’t worry about being perfect – God loves to use imperfect messengers to share His perfect message! Just be willing to work through whatever might be holding you back.  \n\n##### **3. Pray** \n  \nThis is really a part of every other step, but it’s important enough to be on its own too. Pray for opportunities to share your faith. Pray for courage and clarity to share when the time comes. Pray that God would draw people to Himself and save them. Pray that God would [raise up people to share their faith](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+10%3A2&version=NIV). Thank God for the privilege of being a part of the most important mission there is!  \n\n##### **4. Look for opportunities to engage people**\n  \nEmphasis on _look_. This requires effort and intentionality. Do you try to find moments in your daily or weekly routines to engage with people, or are you heads-down and moving as quickly as you can? Is your schedule so packed that you can’t stop and talk with someone for a few minutes? Are you on your phone everywhere you go? Do you fill the conversations that you do have with things that don’t really matter, overlooking opportunities to go deeper? The opportunities to engage are everywhere, but you have to look for them. And sometimes, you have to create them.  \n  \nDon’t just look overseas. [International discipleship trips](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/ministries/international/international-discipleship-trips) are great, but sharing the gospel is something you should do close to home, not only across an ocean. Jump in on an [Unashamed](http://www.watermark.org/ministries/unashamed) weekend mission trip right here in Dallas. And even better, look for opportunities in your everyday life to engage with people. Talk to that coworker over lunch, or with that person at the gym, or with that salesperson, or your neighbor, or with that person asking you for spare change. Look for ways to serve the people that God puts in your path, and use that as a way to live out the gospel and then share it.  \n\n##### **5. Connect relationally**\n  \nWhen you have a conversation with someone, treat them like a valuable fellow human being, not a project. You should be trying to _plant_ the gospel, not just crop-dust it as you fly by. If you have the time, get to know them personally. Ask them their story. Share yours. Show them that you care about them. Use their name. Look them in the eye. Be warm and friendly. People will see right through you if you’re just trying to drop some truth and then move on. Build a friendship, even if it’s one that lasts for only the few minutes that you’re talking. You never know – it might be a friendship that lasts for eternity in heaven!  \n\n##### **6. Get to the gospel** \n  \n[Make the most of every opportunity](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=colossians+4%3A5-6&version=NIV) you have by getting to the gospel. Sometimes you might have only one conversation with a person, like that waiter on your road trip, so it would need to happen pretty quickly. Or sometimes you might have a little more time, like with that new person in the cube next to you, so you can build a genuine friendship. Point being, whether it’s in five minutes, five days, or five weeks, share the gospel. Don’t procrastinate, and do it with your words, not just your actions.  \n  \nAs far as _how_ to share it, there are ways like the [Romans Road](https://www.gotquestions.org/Romans-road-salvation.html), the [Good News / Bad News](https://www.gotquestions.org/bad-news-good-news.html) approach, or the [Bridge Illustration](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rrgq5nf400y31ag/One-Verse%20Bridge%20Illustration%20-%20Romans%206.23.pdf?dl=0). Pick at least one and get familiar with it so that you’d be comfortable sharing it at any time. My personal favorite is the bridge illustration because it’s visual and easy to explain.  \n  \nAnd then practically, how do you transition the conversation to the gospel? There are a lot of different ways to work it in. The most simple and straightforward is asking a question like, “do you have a faith?” People are often willing to talk about what they believe. There are other ways you can do this too, based on what the person is sharing. Are they anxious? Share how the gospel addresses all our fears and worries. Are they insecure? Share how the gospel provides identity, value, and worth. Are they looking for answers? Share how the gospel gives the best explanation for the brokenness around us and the hope for the future. Are they suffering? Share how the gospel provides help to the hurting. Are they longing for something more? Share how the gospel satisfies our deepest desires.  \n  \nHowever and whenever you do it, make sure to actually get to the gospel.  \n\n##### **7. Trust God with the outcome**\n  \nOnce you’ve shared, the ball is not in your court anymore. Effective evangelism doesn’t mean that everyone you share with trusts Christ right then. You’re not responsible for saving anyone – that’s God’s job, so you can rest easy and trust Him. There will be mixed reactions. Some will be critics, others curious, and others converts. Success for you is to be faithful in sharing. Pray that people respond to the message by trusting Christ, but don’t consider yourself a failure if they don’t. You might be the one [planting the seed, or watering it, but God’s the one who makes it grow](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+3%3A7&version=NIV).  \n  \nWhich of these keys do you need to put into practice?

It was a war game and I was walking around an urban setting trying not to get shot. There were other people present, and it was the kind of game where you had to kill the bad guys but not shoot the good guys, and not get shot yourself. Just as I was starting to understand how the controls worked, I took a bullet to the head. These games are graphic! (But that’s another blog). My nephew leans over and says, “you gotta kill those guys.” I thought, “Ha. Thanks for telling me.”  \n  \nBefore playing a game like this, it’s important to understand the things that will help you succeed and the “enemies” that are seeking to destroy you. Life is similar. A lot of your life can be put into these two categories: things that help you succeed, and things that hurt you.  \n  \n\n\n##### **Get to know your enemies**\n  \nFor me, it seems easier to identify the things that help me be successful. However, sometimes it is very difficult to identify the things that are trying to kill me. For most of us they are camouflaged into our routines hidden behind familiarity. For example, I’ll catch myself at a stop light checking Twitter. It’s not a general “what are people saying?” check. Rather, I’ll go over to the “mentions” tab to see “what are people saying about me?” This was a nearly every day, sometimes multiple times a day, habit. And for me, it was deadly. If there was a criticism, it could impact my mood or distract me from what I needed to focus on. If there was nothing there, I’d wonder why? If there was praise, I would be [tempted to find identity in it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs+27%3A21&version=NIV). None of this was conscious thought. It was a normal activity that otherwise seemed harmless. It was like one of those guys from the video game that wanted to kill me, but I couldn’t recognize it as an enemy.  \n  \nThese enemies also live outside of social media. We’ve talked before about [how our enemy, Satan, is after us](http://www.theporchdallas.com/your-enemy-is-after-you/). The kinds of enemies I’m talking about here are the tools that he uses. They are second glances at someone who is not your spouse. They are schemes to make more money. They are Google image searches that might turn up something deadly. They are clicks into a world that could expose you to images that are hard to forget. They are thoughts of discontentment. They are conversations in your head with someone who is not even in your presence. Sooner or later you find yourself worked up about a conversation that never really happened – at least not in real life.  \n  \nThese enemies are so familiar, it is very difficult to kill them. We’ve lived with them for so long, they are a part of us – like brushing our teeth or eating. They are so much a part of routine that they’ve become some of who we are. It’s like when [Old Yeller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Yeller_(film)) became rabid, his owner really struggled to put down the pet that he lived with for so long. But his friend had become a dangerous enemy, and killing him was necessary.  \n  \n  \n\n##### **How to get rid of your enemies**\n  \nThe first thing you have to do is identify the enemy. Once you can see it as your enemy and clearly put it in that category, you are one step closer to success. Secondly, you need to determine how to kill it. In my nephew’s game, there were different options for weapons depending on the situations (important to note, I am obviously speaking figuratively and not of killing anything actually living). This part will probably take some time and thought, and you should get help from other Christians in your life. You have to get really specific here – just trying to fight “pride” or “lust” won’t help you. For example, you might need to remove a particular social media platform that is tripping you up, or stop clicking on a certain hashtag. You might need to stop watching certain movies or shows. You might need to commit to bouncing your eyes from all those second glances. You might need to commit to auditing your thoughts and work hard to change your thoughts toward something more productive when you begin to have imaginary conversations. Or, maybe you commit to calling the person every time you start a conversation with them in your head.  \n  \nAfter you’ve removed them from your routine, you should set out a checkpoint. Every game with a mission has some kind of checkpoint. This is a destination that you get to and evaluate how much life you have left and overall how you are doing. Go in your calendar and schedule a checkpoint 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, and 6 months out. Stop to reflect on how you’re doing at fighting the enemies that you’ve identified. Invite some other people in your life into praying with you for this and processing this with you.  \n  \nEvery now and then, these enemies are going to sneak up on you. Don’t get discouraged. Go back to your plan: identify them, remove them, and set opportunities in the future to evaluate how you’re doing at fighting them. Remember that Jesus ultimately defeated our enemy for us. Winning in this life starts with understanding that He has already won for us. He paid for every enemy that we succumb to, and so now we fight from a place of victory (1 Corinthians 15:57).  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

All my life, I’ve thought of slavery as a terrible thing. In the wake of our country’s gross abuse of humans, you can understand why. Slavery, though, is a metaphor used all through the Bible (_note: this is_ [_not the same kind of slavery_](https://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-slavery.html) _that Juneteenth commemorates)._  \n  \nMetaphor is not really the right word there, as I believe it is meant more literally than metaphorically. And in those cases that I’m referring to, slavery is not a bad thing. For example, Jesus Himself says that anyone who wants to be great must first be a “[slave of all](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark+10%3A43-45&version=NIV)” (Mark 10:44).  \n  \nFifteen years ago, I stumbled into a church hung over, and a story about a horse changed my life. This horse wanted to run free, but he didn’t truly experience freedom until he was fully submissive to his master, who was kind to him and met all his needs. At that point in my life, I wanted freedom. And if freedom came through submission, I was intrigued. As I trusted Christ and believed [the gospel](http://www.theporchdallas.com/the-gospel/), I experienced for myself the unique truth of Christianity – that absolute freedom comes from full submission, and victory comes by way of surrender.  \n  \nMy daughter Presley’s parakeet “Turquoise” serves as a modern reminder to me. We let him out of his cage all the time, but inevitably, at first opportunity, he flies back to it and wants to go back inside. Several months ago, while holding Turquoise, Presley made the mistake of taking him outside. Of course, he flew off, over the houses, until he became a small turquoise speck disappearing into the horizon. She stood there on the sidewalk, devastated. My wife and Presley drove around the city looking for Turquoise. This was more to help Presley cope with losing him than any actual strategy of finding the bird. But as they gave up and returned home, Turquoise was in the front yard waiting on them! He didn’t want to fly free. He wanted to go back in his cage, and he was waiting for someone to let him in. Freedom for Turquoise looks like being safe in our house and in his cage most of the time, letting us take care of him.\n\n##### **Freedom can make you a slave**\n  \nBut cages aren’t freeing or safe if _you_ are the one in it instead of a bird. Many of us want to be free. However, in our pursuit of freedom, we become slaves, locked in cages we can’t escape. We believe the lie that now is the time to treat ourselves to whatever we want, because we can always grow up and settle down later. We want the freedom to spend money however we want, and we become a slave to stuff, locked in the cage of materialism. We want the freedom to find significance in work, and we become a slave to the office, [locked in the cage of chasing success](http://www.theporchdallas.com/your-success-could-be-your-downfall/). We want the freedom to look at whatever we want, and then we’re trapped by porn and [can’t stop looking](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-i-love-porn/). We want the freedom to get drunk, and soon we can’t enjoy life without alcohol.  \n  \nIt might not happen right away. [The consequences don’t always show up immediately](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ecclesiastes+8%3A11&version=NIV). But the law of the harvest holds true if you are planting sin into your life with your attitude and actions – you reap _what_ you sow, you reap _more than_ what you sowed, and you reap it _later than you sowed it._  \n  \nLiving that way, sooner or later we want freedom from integrity and accountability. Ultimately, we receive freedom from spiritual growth, and our lives are devoid of any intimacy with Jesus. A fish might want to be free from water, but the pursuit of that freedom will not go well for the fish. Likewise, the pursuit of freedom from full submission to Jesus will not go well for anyone. Most often people with lots of freedom become dysfunctional. Think about that person you know who gets to do whatever they please. They often end up in a trap of narcissism, and empty, pointless, living.  \n\n##### **Slavery can make you free**\n  \nJesus Christ offers us freedom from our sin, but the freedom comes through slavery. We are slaves to Him. He is a good Master. I imagine the reason Turquoise loves his cage, is because he has a master who loves him and provides for his every need there. He is protected and cared for there. Where else would he go? Like the disciples said in the gospels when Jesus asked if they wanted to leave him, “[…to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+6%3A68&version=NIV).” (John 6:68)  \n  \n[Jesus is calling you to full devotion](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+16%3A24-27&version=NIV). If reading the Bible is challenging in this season, or if prayer feels toilsome, or your faith is stagnant, consider this: are you pursuing freedom in anything other than Jesus? Has your sin led you into an invisible cage that is not the cage of a loving Master? Jesus is calling you out of that cage and into another kind of cage. It is one of both slavery and freedom. It is where you are [doing everything He says](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+14%3A15&version=NIV), and it leads you to a [full, abundant, life](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+10%3A10&version=NIV). We’d love to help you find that freedom! It is one of absolute obedience, full surrender, and complete submission to a loving Master. Where in your life are you not fully submitting to God’s will? Get help from God’s people to stop it.  \n  \n- JP  \n  \n  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

They each walk up to an elephant and grab a different part and describe what they feel. One blind man grabs the tusk and thinks that an elephant is like a spear. Another feels the trunk and concludes that an elephant is like a snake. The guy hugging the leg thinks it’s like a tree. The one holding the tail claims that it’s like a rope. Another feeling the ear believes it’s like a fan. The last one leaning on the elephant’s side thinks that it’s like a wall.  \n  \nWhat does that have to do with God and faith? This parable is sometimes ([incorrectly](http://pleaseconvinceme.com/2013/the-six-blind-men-and-the-elephant-a-case-for-religious-pluralism/)) used to describe how different religions approach truth – each of them are only working with what they know, nobody sees the whole picture, and in a sense they are _all_ right – an elephant is like all of those things! Therefore, every religion is accurate in its own way, and they all share in some part of the truth. They should all just get along, since there are many ways to God / enlightenment / nirvana / paradise, and everyone is on their own truth journey. This sums up the idea of [religious pluralism](https://www.gotquestions.org/religious-pluralism.html).  \n  \nThere’s a big problem here. The idea that [“there are many ways to God” is incredibly bad advice](http://www.watermark.org/message/4874)! Not every way works, and not every way even claims to work the same. Here are four ways to get to God. Spoiler alert: they are not all good ones.  \n  \n**Bad Way #1: By any religion you choose**  \n  \nSome people choose their faith like they choose a flavor of ice cream. All ice cream is good, and you just go with the one that tastes best to you. “Buddhism tastes good to you? Go for it. Atheism has the best flavor for your palate? Can’t dispute that!” These are decisions of _preference_.  \n  \nBut is that the best way to make a decision about life, death, and eternity? A better way is to base that decision on _truth._ What is truth? It’s what most accurately reflects reality and life as it really _is_.  \n  \nYou might think that religions have different “flavors” but are all basically talking about the same thing, like the blind guys feeling the elephant. But that ignores the contradictory truth claims that are at the foundation of various religions. When we die, we either go to heaven, are reincarnated, are absorbed into the cosmic consciousness, or rot away in the ground. But we can’t do all of that at once. Either Jesus was a prophet but not God (Islam), a wise man (Hinduism), a wrongly misguided man (atheism), or God in the flesh (Christianity). But He can’t be all those things. The logical law of non-contradiction means that different, contradicting things cannot all be true at the same time. This applies to literally everything, including faiths.  \n  \nInstead of choosing your faith like ice cream – “what tastes best to me?”, choose it more like you’d choose medicine or a doctor – “which one will heal me?” That’s also an imperfect analogy, but it’s closer to the truth.  \n  \nWe believe that there is only one Divine Physician. Do His claims have any merit? Keep reading.  \n  \n**Bad Way #2: By being good enough**  \n  \nSomething about being good enough for God resonates with a lot of people. You largely get what you earn in life, so why would the afterlife be any different? We like the idea of getting into heaven based on our own merits. After all, we’re pretty good people, and most of us haven’t killed anyone!  \n  \nThe thing is, “good enough” is impossible when it comes to God and heaven. Romans 3:23 says that everyone’s a sinner. Nobody’s perfect. We can all agree there. But how good is good enough? Romans 3:20 says that it’s impossible to be righteous (“good enough”) in God’s eyes through good works. So there is no such thing as good enough, at least not in a way that you can earn yourself. John 6:28-29 says that God doesn’t even want us to try to be good enough but to believe in Jesus, the One who was good enough on our behalf. Trying to be good enough to be accepted by God is a literal dead end.  \n  \n_We’ve written more extensively about this_ [_in another post_](http://www.theporchdallas.com/you-arent-good-enough-for-heaven/)_. Read it if you’re wrestling with wanting to be good enough for God._  \n  \n**Bad Way #3: By standing before Him in judgment**  \n  \nThis last way of getting to God works 100% of the time, no matter your religion, but it’s not the way to you want to show up. Hebrews 9:27 says that every person is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment before Him. This means that in an incredibly ironic sense, every religion will get you _to_ God. But not every religion will get you [_accepted_ by God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+15%3A7&version=NIV). No matter what you believe, you will meet Him when you die. Jesus said in Matthew 25:31-46 that everyone will face Him and be at a crossroads. [The righteous](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A21&version=NIV) will go to eternal life, and the wicked will go away to eternal punishment.  \n  \nYou will eventually get to God, but there’s only one way for you to stay there.  \n  \n**Jesus: THE Way to get to God**  \n  \nJesus claimed to be the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). Sometimes Christians get a bad rap for being close-minded to other religions. People say that Jesus would have let people just believe and do whatever they wanted, because He was so full of love and acceptance. When that happens, you can point to what He actually said: “…no one comes to the Father except through me.” That’s a pretty exclusive statement! Jesus said He was the only way to God.  \n  \nWhy should you believe Him? Jesus backs up His claim with unique credentials. He lived a perfect life, embodied the attributes of God, and fulfilled dozens of prophecies written centuries before He was born. Unlike other religious leaders, Jesus also proved who He was by performing incredible miracles in broad daylight, in front of skeptics. He demonstrated His authority over nature, sickness, and death. In the most incredible example of Him being God, Jesus fulfilled His own prediction by being resurrected from the dead, which is a historical event that was witnessed by more than 500 people and that started a spiritual revolution unlike anything else in the history of the world. No other religious book or leader can claim all of those and validate its truth claims like Jesus and the Bible can.  \n  \nJesus is exclusive, yes, but He’s also incredibly _inclusive_. He invites _all_ people to come to Him (Matthew 11:28-30). No one is excluded from this invitation. Everyone is welcome! But they have to come through Jesus. Don’t buy the bad advice that there are many ways to God.  \n  \nDo you know Jesus? If not, we’d love to tell you about Him!  \n  \n- Luke  \n  \n  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

They’re an interruption, obnoxious, and generally trying to sell you things you don’t need. The only benefit might be that they allow you the opportunity to be somewhat productive and move around after sitting on the couch for awhile. While commercials compete for your hard-earned money and are usually mostly harmless, there are other things that compete for your attention and that, if left unchecked, could prove to be dangerous.  \n  \nLast week we talked about how there is a [very real, yet unseen enemy](http://www.theporchdallas.com/how-the-unseen-realm-is-affecting-you/) who affects our world and desires to steal your joy and wreck your life by any means necessary. This enemy is an enemy of everyone, though he [masquerades his tactics as innocent things](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+11%3A14&version=NIV) to lure you away from God.\n\n##### **What’s competing for your heart?**\n  \nStop for a minute and think about the [things that are competing for your heart](http://www.theporchdallas.com/identifyingyourenemies/). Is it social media and seeing all your friends getting married and popping out kids (1 Corinthians 7:32-35)? Is it your scrawny bank account and all the things you miss out on because the funds aren’t there (Philippians 4:12-13, Matthew 6:25-26)? Is it looking in the mirror and not being happy with the body that stares back at you (Psalm 139:1-14)?  \n  \nThese ideas and thoughts are dangerous because they lead you to believe that God doesn’t care about you, that He’s forgotten about you, or that He loves others more than you since they have all these things and you don’t. Satan uses thoughts like that to chip away at your faith and plant the seeds of doubt, which can cause you to do some pretty dire things to correct what you think is wrong. Ultimately this leads to very negative consequences.  \n\n##### **Consider the consequences**\n  \nGod, in spite of me, has allowed me the privilege of leading and preaching to young adults here and around the country. Now, imagine how much damage sin could do if I fell back into the traps of porn or adultery. Think of how that would hurt my wife, kids, extended family and all those in our ministry. Now think about yourself - what might the consequences in your life be if you gave yourself over to your sinful desires?  \n  \nI’m capable of all that and more if I’m living by my flesh. I need community to help me fully and quickly confess my sin (James 5:16), so I don’t allow the enemy to gain a foothold where he can lead me down a path of destruction (Ephesians 4:27). I need to abide daily in the Word of God (John 15:4) even when the desire to do so may not always be there.  \n\n##### **Using the tools at your disposal**\n  \nGod gives us protection from the evil one in the form of His Word and other believers, which is why [biblical community is so important](http://www.theporchdallas.com/choosingfriends/). And, [like we talked about on Tuesday](http://www.watermark.org/message/4913), God has given us armor and weapons to fight with (Ephesians 6:10-18). The helmet of salvation. The shield of faith. The belt of truth. The breastplate of righteousness. The sword of the Spirit. Do you know what these things are, and how to use them? [Here is a great explanation](https://www.gotquestions.org/full-armor-of-God.html).  \n  \nAs you look to use the tools at your disposal, you can’t fight alone. You must surround yourself with other believers – people you can turn to when you’re unsure of things and who you can confess your sins to. A primary tactic the enemy uses to keep you enslaved in a sin struggle is tricking you into keeping your sins in the dark instead of exposing them. While exposing your sin isn’t fun, exposing it reaps huge benefits for you (Proverbs 28:13, James 5:16). Your community also sees things that you don’t, and they can provide valuable insight and wisdom in your fight against sin. Lean on them.  \n  \nWith you in the fight,  \n  \nJP  \n  \n_(with help from Jordan Loa)_  \n  \n  \n  \n_We’d love to hear from you!

Paris. Charlottesville. Barcelona. What do all these places have in common? They were the settings where evil manifested itself in the form of great loss, hatred, and pain. What do you and all these places and terrible events have in common?  \n  \nThe same force that drove those that committed these crimes is also after you and will stop at nothing to see you destroy yourself.  \n  \nThat’s right. [God’s enemy, and your enemy, too, is constantly after you](http://www.theporchdallas.com/your-enemy-is-after-you/), throwing temptation after temptation at you, contorting the truth, and basically doing anything to lure you away from the light, truth, and hope of Jesus Christ.  \n  \nAt The Porch, we’re talking about the spiritual realities that surround us – unseen wars, worlds, and wonders. Last Tuesday we talked about the [unseen reason for evil in the world](http://www.watermark.org/message/4902). What does God’s Word tell us about these unseen enemies?\n\n  \n- The Bible tells us that our struggle is not of this world, (Ephesians 6:12) Satan is not limited in his travels (Job 2:2), he is powerful (Acts 19:15) and that he can even disguise himself (2 Corinthians 11:14).\n  \n- Satan twists the truth and is fluent only in the language of lies. He wants nothing more than to steal your joy, ruin your relationships and pull you away from God (John 10:10).\n  \n- Satan blinds people so they can’t see the truth of Christ or the error of their ways before major damage has been done (2 Cor. 4:4).\n  \n- He is always on the lookout for someone to ruin (1 Peter 5:8).\n  \n- Our own evil desires inside of us lead us to temptation, sin, and eventually death if we keep following them (James 1:13-15).\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##### **How is the enemy affecting you?**\n  \nWhile Satan may not be tempting you to commit mass murder or participate in violence, he is plotting and trying to trip you up in other ways, [often with things that don’t seem so harmful](http://www.theporchdallas.com/identifyingyourenemies/). Satan doesn’t care if you worship him; he just doesn’t want you worshipping or following Christ, and he uses your naturally sinful self to try to pull you away from God.  \n  \nThat half a pack a day habit. That occasional (or more than occasional) porn visit. The pride that fills your heart. The love of money and stuff. All of these things shift your focus from God and fill your heart and mind with things that will [cause you pain and enslave you](http://www.theporchdallas.com/freedomandslavery/).  \n  \nFor those that have accepted Christ’s payment for sins (Romans 5:8, John 3:16), your eternity rests securely in Christ and nothing can ever change that (John 10:28, Romans 8:38-39). But even though your eternity is secure, there can still be very real and damaging consequences for following your sinful nature.  \n\n##### **Fighting the enemy with truth**\n  \nSo, how can you stand firm in the midst of temptation from this unseen malicious force?  \n\n  \n- Get plugged in [to a church](http://www.theporchdallas.com/why-church-membership-is-important/) and [community](http://www.theporchdallas.com/choosingfriends/). God tells us that believers are strengthened and thrive in settings with other believers (Hebrews 3:13/Proverbs 17:17).\n  \n- Read and study God’s word daily. God’s Word renews your mind and reminds you of the truth. Satan is clever in his attacks, but is no match for the living word of God (Hebrews 4:12). If you’d like help in doing this, [check out these opportunities to grow in your faith](http://www.watermark.org/dallas/equipping)!\n  \n- Do whatever it takes to get well and fight the evil desires inside of you, like checking out a Christ-centered recovery program such as [re:generation on Mondays nights](http://www.watermark.org/events/20).\n  \n  \nRemember, Satan has already been defeated by Christ’s work on the cross, and he is fighting from a position of defeat. The mastery of your own sinful desires has also been broken by the [new nature that you received when you trusted Christ](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+corinthians+5%3A17&version=NIV). That being said, Satan can still wreak havoc in your life if you aren’t vigilant, and the sinful desires in your own heart will ruin you if they aren’t addressed.
